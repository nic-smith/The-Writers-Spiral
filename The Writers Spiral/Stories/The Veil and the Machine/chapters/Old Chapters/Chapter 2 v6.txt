Chapter 2: Into the Heat

The air was thick and heavy, each step dragging them deeper into the oppressive heat of the forest. The storm had broken, but its remnants clung to the trees, beads of water slipping from branches and pooling on the forest floor. With every step, the mud sucked at their boots, slowing them down, as if the forest itself were reluctant to let them pass.

“Feels like walking through a swamp,” Griffin muttered, slapping at the cloud of mosquitoes that buzzed relentlessly around him. He grimaced, wiping the sweat from his brow, his usual composure cracking under the barrage of bites. “I swear these things have been waiting for us.”

Sari swatted a mosquito off her arm, grimacing as another darted straight for her face. “Maybe they’re allies of Metis,” she joked, though her eyes were dark with irritation.

Talon gave a weak smile, the medallion’s weight pulling heavily at his neck as he adjusted it under his shirt. It was warm against his chest, like a sunbeam that wouldn’t fade, a constant reminder of the vision that had led them here. He tried to focus on the familiar pull, on the sense of purpose that had driven him into the forest, but Griffin’s grumbling broke through his concentration.

“You remember Red Arrow Camp?” Griffin asked, his tone lightening slightly as he glanced over at Talon. “That summer by the lake? You nearly lost a whole night’s sleep fighting off mosquitoes there too.”

Talon chuckled, swatting at a mosquito that buzzed too close. “I remember. And you were ready to call it quits before sundown.” He grinned, letting himself sink into the memory. “You said we were under ‘full-scale attack.’”

Griffin laughed, shaking his head. “Hey, that’s because we were. But I lasted longer than you give me credit for. Besides, you were the one who thought standing in the water would keep them off you.”

Sari gave a snort, raising an eyebrow. “Wait—you thought mosquitoes wouldn’t find you in the water?”

“Seemed logical at the time,” Talon admitted, laughing as he recalled the image of his younger self standing ankle-deep in the lake, surrounded by buzzing insects. “Turns out they’re persistent little demons.”

“Yeah, well, I was about ready to set up camp in a tent made out of mosquito netting.” Griffin grinned, wiping his brow as they continued to trudge through the dense underbrush. “Those were the days, huh? Just us, the lake, and a swarm of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.”

Sari shook her head, but there was a smile on her lips. “So basically, not much has changed.”

They laughed, the sound echoing faintly through the dense forest, blending with the rustling of leaves and the constant drone of insects. For a moment, the oppressive heat and the fatigue seemed to fade, replaced by the warmth of shared memories, the bond they’d forged through years of friendship.

But the forest was unyielding, each step forward feeling heavier as they moved deeper into its shadowed heart. The ground grew steeper, the mud thicker, and the air somehow even more stifling. Talon’s gaze drifted toward the distant mountains, barely visible through the canopy, their dark shapes etched against the sky like silent sentinels.

“Parque de Santiago,” he murmured, half to himself. “We must’ve entered somewhere near there.” He tried to gauge their distance, estimating how far they might have come. It felt like miles, though in the thick of the forest, distance seemed to stretch and blur, each step dragging them further into the unknown.

Griffin looked over, catching the faint uncertainty in Talon’s expression. “So, fearless leader, any idea where we’re actually headed?”

Talon hesitated, his fingers brushing against the medallion, feeling its faint warmth through his shirt. “The medallion… it’s guiding me. Or at least, I think it is. There’s something—” He broke off, glancing at Griffin, knowing how it must sound. “It’s like I’m being pulled, but I can’t explain it.”

Griffin’s face was a mixture of skepticism and something else, a hint of the trust they’d built over years that softened his usual edge. “You’ve always had a weird instinct, Talon. Just… don’t get us lost.”

“Don’t worry,” Sari added, smirking. “We’ll be fine. As long as we have a solid backup plan in case Talon’s ‘instinct’ starts acting up.”

Talon forced a smile, but his fingers lingered on the medallion. He could feel the pull, faint but steady, like a thread tying him to something unseen. Somewhere in his mind, Dominic’s words echoed—the warnings, the confessions, the way the man had spoken of being called into the shadows.

His gaze drifted to the journal in his pack. He hadn’t shared everything yet, and with each step forward, the weight of what he hadn’t said seemed to grow heavier. Griffin’s jokes, Sari’s calm support… they grounded him, reminded him of why they’d come this far together. But he knew that if he revealed everything, the darkness Dominic hinted at, the things left unsaid, would start to creep into their group like the forest’s shadows.

Griffin pushed another branch aside, his voice breaking into Talon’s thoughts. “So, if the mosquitoes are working for Metis, what’s next? Ants? Snakes? Maybe the trees?”

Sari snorted, grinning. “Great. Now we’re fighting an army of woodland creatures.”

They laughed again, but there was a strain to it, an undertone of unease. The forest was vast, a maze of green and shadow, each step forward taking them further from the world they knew and closer to something unseen, something waiting.

As they moved deeper, Talon felt the medallion grow slightly warmer, a subtle reminder of the path he couldn’t see but felt all the same. The forest seemed to close in tighter, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, the shadows growing darker with each step.

And though he kept the memories alive in their laughter, Talon knew that the further they went, the harder it would be to hold onto the light.

---

The forest grew denser as they pushed onward, each tree seemingly closer than the last, and the silence becoming more pronounced. The mud clung to their boots, dragging at their steps, while the canopy above formed a thick blanket, blocking out the sun’s warmth and leaving the air thick and damp.

Talon slowed, his gaze drifting down to the journal tucked securely in his pack. Dominic’s words had been gnawing at him, the confessions and warnings threading through his thoughts like tendrils of smoke. He glanced back at Sari and Griffin, who trudged along, swatting at mosquitoes and muttering under their breath.

Griffin caught his eye, raising an eyebrow. “You keep looking at that journal like it’s hiding the world’s secrets. Care to enlighten us?”

Talon hesitated, gripping the journal tighter. He’d been wrestling with how much to share, sifting through Dominic’s entries, trying to find a way to explain without casting shadows on himself or the medallion. The thought of Griffin’s skepticism only deepened his reluctance, but he knew he couldn’t avoid it forever.

“There’s… a lot in here,” he began, choosing his words carefully. “It’s not all clear. Dominic was… struggling with something. He felt like he was being pulled somewhere, like there was a place he couldn’t ignore.”

Sari leaned in, her face calm but curious. “Pulled? Like he was following something?”

“Sort of,” Talon replied, his voice low. “He doesn’t explain it exactly, but he wrote about shadows, things he could see but couldn’t understand.” He paused, gauging their reactions. “It’s as if… something was leading him, and he didn’t know if he could trust it.”

Griffin scoffed lightly, adjusting the strap on his pack. “Great. So, we’re trusting the ramblings of someone who sounds like they were half out of their mind?”

Talon looked down, brushing his thumb over the journal’s worn leather cover. “It’s not that simple. Dominic was… he was afraid of what he was feeling, of where he was being led. But he kept going because he thought it was important. Like there was something he was supposed to find.”

Sari’s eyes softened, and she placed a reassuring hand on Talon’s shoulder. “It sounds like he was searching for answers, just like we are.”

Talon nodded, grateful for her support, but his mind lingered on the parts he hadn’t shared—the passages where Dominic spoke of visions, of things that haunted him even in sleep. The hints that whatever power lay within the Veil piece he’d taken from Daniel had consumed him.

He wanted to keep that part hidden, to avoid Griffin’s inevitable skepticism. But he could feel the weight of those unspoken words pressing down on him, pulling at him like the medallion’s silent call.

They continued in silence, the forest growing darker as the canopy thickened. Talon’s mind raced, the lines from Dominic’s diary playing through his thoughts in a relentless loop:

*“The Veil… it isn’t protection. It’s something more, something darker. I took it from him, and now I can’t escape it. It calls to me, even when I try to run.”*

He closed his eyes briefly, as if the words themselves held a dangerous power, one he wasn’t sure he could contain. Griffin’s voice cut into his thoughts, sharp and laced with suspicion.

“So, Talon, this… Veil thing Dominic keeps mentioning—what exactly is it? You seem to know more than you’re letting on.”

Talon glanced at Griffin, trying to keep his expression neutral. “I don’t know exactly. He didn’t leave much about that part. Just… the name.” He took a slow breath. “And that it was something people used to believe had… power.”

Griffin frowned, clearly unconvinced. “People believe a lot of things have power. Doesn’t mean they’re real.” He let out a frustrated sigh. “I just don’t like the idea of wandering aimlessly because of someone else’s obsession.”

Sari stepped in, her voice steady. “None of us do. But we’re here because Talon had a vision, and we’re trusting that. Maybe Dominic’s experiences were different, but that doesn’t mean we should give up on what brought us here.”

Talon felt a surge of gratitude toward her, but Griffin’s words had left an uncomfortable residue in his mind. There was truth in them, a reminder that he was walking a thin line, one that could easily unravel if he wasn’t careful.

He ran his fingers over the journal’s cover again, feeling the worn edges beneath his fingertips, the weight of the words that Dominic had written, the darkness that seemed to seep through the pages. It was as if Dominic had been trying to leave a warning, a message to anyone who followed.

*“I took it from him… but it’s not mine to keep. It’s changing me, like it did him. I don’t know if I can control it.”*

Talon kept that part to himself, hiding it behind a carefully constructed wall of silence. He didn’t want to let the fear show, didn’t want them to see the cracks in his own resolve.

Sari glanced over, noticing his distant expression. “You all right?”

He forced a nod, shaking off the unease that had settled over him. “Yeah. Just… a lot to think about.”

She gave him a reassuring smile, and for a moment, the weight lifted. But Griffin’s skeptical gaze remained, piercing through the forest’s shadows as if searching for answers he knew Talon was withholding.

As they moved deeper into the woods, the forest grew quieter, the air thicker, pressing down on them with an intensity that was hard to ignore. The shadows seemed to stretch longer, darker, merging with the edges of their vision as though the forest itself were watching.

Talon’s hand drifted to the medallion, feeling its warmth, its steady pull. Somewhere in his mind, Dominic’s words echoed again, like a whisper from a forgotten place:

*“The Veil is a curse. And once you carry it, it’s never yours alone.”*

But he couldn’t say it. Couldn’t risk the fragile trust that held them together, the thread that bound them to this path. Instead, he tightened his grip on the medallion, forcing himself to focus on the journey, to ignore the growing shadows that crept closer with each step.

---

The forest grew thicker and darker as they pressed onward, each step feeling heavier, the air laden with an oppressive stillness that only deepened the further they went. The sounds of the forest, the quiet rustle of leaves, the occasional snap of a branch, seemed to fade, replaced by a silence that felt almost watchful, as if the trees themselves held their breath.

Talon lagged behind slightly, the medallion’s subtle pull drawing him forward, but the weight of Dominic’s journal was a heavier anchor, each word a reminder of the shadows he was carrying alone. He pulled it from his pack, flipping through the worn pages, the scrawled handwriting rough and hurried. Dominic’s words blurred before him, half-seen warnings buried within the frantic script.

A low voice broke through his thoughts. “What are you keeping from us, Talon?”

Talon glanced up, meeting Griffin’s hard gaze. The usual warmth in Griffin’s eyes had dimmed, replaced by a glint of distrust that Talon had been dreading. Griffin crossed his arms, his expression unreadable but edged with frustration.

“Nothing I haven’t told you,” Talon replied, forcing his voice to stay steady, even though he could feel his grip on the journal tightening. “It’s just… a lot to take in.”

Griffin’s eyes narrowed. “A lot to take in, or a lot to hide?”

Sari stepped forward, her expression softer, though her eyes were laced with curiosity. “We trust you, Talon. But if there’s more—anything that could help us understand this… Veil thing better—you should tell us.”

Talon took a slow breath, flipping to a page he’d already read a dozen times, each line haunting him with its weight. “Dominic was… haunted by it. He felt like he was carrying something he couldn’t control. He wrote about shadows, voices… things he could barely describe.” He hesitated, feeling the urge to stop, to tuck the journal away, but he forced himself to continue. “And he kept mentioning a pull, something drawing him deeper.”

Sari glanced around, her gaze thoughtful as she absorbed his words. “So, he felt what you’re feeling now?”

“Maybe,” Talon admitted. “But I don’t know if it’s the same thing. He never explained what he meant by the Veil, just… that it was more than he could handle.” He looked down, unwilling to meet their eyes, the words he hadn’t spoken pressing against his throat like a secret he couldn’t let out.

Griffin’s expression softened slightly, though his voice was still wary. “You’re saying he couldn’t handle it, but you think you can?”

Talon’s mouth went dry, the question cutting deeper than he’d expected. He hadn’t wanted to face it, hadn’t wanted to acknowledge the possibility that whatever Dominic had experienced could become his own fate. But he couldn’t let the doubt show, not here, not now.

“I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice barely more than a whisper. “But I have to try. We all have to, or we wouldn’t be here.”

Sari’s hand brushed his arm, her touch grounding him, pulling him from the depths of Dominic’s words and the shadows they cast. “We trust you,” she said softly, her eyes meeting his with a quiet assurance that steadied him, even as Griffin’s doubt lingered between them.

They moved forward, Talon’s mind still caught on Dominic’s entries, the cryptic phrases etched into his memory. He felt the medallion pulse again, a faint warmth that seeped into his chest, a reminder of the path he was bound to follow, even if he didn’t fully understand where it led.

---

The light began to fade, the sun sinking below the treetops, casting long shadows that stretched across the forest floor. The silence grew heavier, pressing down on them, each footfall swallowed by the dense undergrowth as they pushed deeper into the gloom.

“Why do I feel like we’re being watched?” Griffin muttered, glancing over his shoulder, his hand instinctively reaching for the knife at his side.

Sari’s gaze swept over the forest, her eyes alert, searching the shadows for any sign of movement. “It’s just the forest, Griffin. We’ve been out here for days. It’s bound to get to us.”

But Talon felt it too, a prickling at the back of his neck, a sense of something lurking just beyond their sight. He tried to shake it off, but Dominic’s words echoed in his mind, a haunting refrain that seemed to mirror the silence around them.

*“The shadows move when you’re not looking. They whisper, and if you listen too closely, you’ll forget what’s real.”*

He closed his eyes briefly, trying to push the words away, but they clung to him, settling into his thoughts like roots sinking into the earth.

Griffin let out a frustrated sigh, his voice a harsh whisper that broke the silence. “I still don’t get why we’re trusting this guy’s half-baked ramblings. This Dominic sounds like he lost his mind, Talon. We could be wandering in circles because of some hallucination.”

Talon felt a flash of defensiveness rise up, his hand clutching the medallion. “It’s more than that. He knew something. Something… real.”

Griffin opened his mouth to argue, but Sari stepped between them, her gaze firm. “Enough. We’re here, and we’re trusting Talon. We wouldn’t be out here if we didn’t believe in this. Let’s focus on getting through, not tearing each other down.”

Griffin let out a huff, but he nodded, his frustration simmering just below the surface. Talon felt a wave of gratitude toward Sari, her presence like a steady light in the encroaching shadows.

They walked on, the forest growing darker, the silence deeper, as if the trees themselves were watching, waiting. Talon felt the medallion’s warmth pulse stronger, its pull guiding him forward, though he didn’t dare tell the others just how strongly he felt it.

As they pushed through a dense thicket, a clearing appeared ahead, the fading light casting long shadows across the open space. Talon felt a shiver run down his spine, a sense that they were stepping into something they couldn’t fully understand.

He glanced at Sari and Griffin, his voice barely a whisper. “We’re close… I can feel it.”

Sari nodded, her face calm, but Griffin’s gaze was wary, his hand gripping his knife tightly. The silence pressed down on them, each of them caught in their own thoughts, their own doubts, as they stared into the growing darkness ahead.

And in the quiet, Talon heard it—the faintest whisper, a voice just beyond hearing, calling to him from the shadows.

---

The clearing was quiet, an unnatural stillness that felt heavy in the humid air. They stood at its edge, each of them tense, senses on high alert. The last traces of daylight faded, leaving the forest wrapped in shadow, the trees looming like silent sentinels around them.

Talon took a step forward, his hand instinctively reaching for the medallion. It pulsed faintly, a warmth that seemed to echo in his chest, guiding him. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were on the edge of something, that Dominic’s whispered warnings were about to manifest.

Sari’s voice broke the silence, low and cautious. “Do you feel that? Like… something’s watching us?”

Griffin scanned the darkening forest, his hand clenched around the hilt of his knife. “I don’t just feel it. I know it.” His voice was tense, his eyes sharp as he looked from shadow to shadow. “We need to be careful. If something’s out there, we’re sitting targets here.”

But even as he spoke, a sudden rustling erupted from the treeline, a shadow shifting against the darkness. Talon’s heart pounded, his fingers tightening around the medallion as he took a step back.

And then they emerged—silent, dark figures slipping from the shadows, their forms barely more than wisps, yet solid enough to send a chill through Talon’s veins. The Eidolons moved with a fluid grace, their shapes blending with the darkness, eyes glinting like shards of night.

For a moment, time froze, the silence between them stretching taut and thin, a breath held in the dark.

Then the first Eidolon lunged.

Griffin moved instinctively, bringing up his knife to meet the shadow, but it slipped past his blade, as if it were made of smoke. He stumbled back, eyes wide with shock as the creature circled him, moving with a predatory patience that made Talon’s skin crawl.

“Sari, watch out!” Talon shouted, his voice breaking the trance. He could see another Eidolon advancing on her, its shadowed form shifting, almost flickering as it closed in.

Sari raised her makeshift weapon, a thick branch she’d picked up earlier, and swung it toward the Eidolon. But it passed through the creature without effect, the branch slipping through its form as if it were striking air. Her eyes widened, her grip tightening as she backed up, her breaths coming quick and shallow.

“Talon, what are these things?” she gasped, her voice barely a whisper, her gaze locked on the advancing shadows.

He didn’t answer—he couldn’t. His mind raced, the medallion pulsing urgently against his chest, as if urging him to act. He gripped it tightly, feeling the heat intensify, the pull stronger, more insistent. But he hesitated, a voice in his mind whispering Dominic’s words, the warning he’d buried beneath the need to move forward.

*“The Veil is a curse. It doesn’t protect—it consumes.”*

But there was no time for caution. The Eidolon closest to him lunged, its dark form stretching, shifting, reaching toward him with shadowed fingers that seemed to leech the light from the air. Talon gritted his teeth, feeling the medallion’s pull, the warmth spilling over him like a wave.

He closed his eyes, letting the energy surge, feeling it rise within him. And then, with a sudden burst, he released it.

A blinding light erupted from the medallion, a flare of energy that pulsed outward, illuminating the clearing in a wash of searing white. The Eidolons shrieked, their forms flickering, retreating, as if the light itself was poison to them. Talon felt the energy drain from him, a wave of exhaustion crashing over him as his vision blurred, his knees buckling under the weight.

But the light faded too quickly, the darkness rushing back, swallowing the clearing once more. The Eidolons recoiled, but only for a moment before they began to regroup, their forms gathering, dark and ominous, their eyes locked on Talon with a new intensity.

Griffin moved to his side, gripping his arm to steady him. “What was that?”

Talon shook his head, his breaths shallow, each one a struggle. “I… I don’t know.” The words were barely a whisper, his mind spinning, the edges of his vision blurred with fatigue. He felt as though he’d given up something vital, the energy that had surged from the medallion leaving him hollow.

Sari was at his other side, her face etched with worry as she looked between him and the shadows gathering at the edge of the clearing. “Can you do it again?”

Talon’s hands trembled, his body drained, the medallion cold against his skin as if it had taken what it needed and left him empty. “I don’t think… I don’t think I can.”

The Eidolons closed in, their forms flickering like flames in the darkness, a silent threat that filled the air with a thick, suffocating dread.

Griffin gritted his teeth, positioning himself between Talon and the advancing shadows. “Then we fight. Whatever it takes.”

Sari took her place beside him, her makeshift branch raised, her stance firm despite the fear in her eyes. “We’re not going down without a fight.”

The first Eidolon lunged again, and Griffin met it head-on, his knife slicing through the air. Though his blade barely seemed to graze its form, the creature shrieked, its shadowy body flickering, retreating only to circle around again.

Sari swung her branch, her movements sharp and focused, forcing the Eidolons back as best she could. But they were surrounded, the shadows pressing in from all sides, a living darkness that seemed to absorb every sound, every breath.

Talon struggled to his feet, his vision swimming, the weight of exhaustion pressing down on him like a leaden cloak. He gripped the medallion, feeling its weight, its power lingering just beyond his reach. But he knew he couldn’t rely on it again—not without risking himself entirely.

The Eidolons circled them, their movements slow, deliberate, as if savoring the fear that clung to the air, the tension thickening with each passing second. Talon could feel their hunger, a darkness that went beyond mere survival, a force that seemed to pull at the very edges of his mind.

And then, as suddenly as they had appeared, the Eidolons froze, their dark forms rippling, shifting as though caught by an unseen force. They paused, their eyes fixed on something beyond the clearing, something only they could sense.

Without a sound, they began to retreat, slipping back into the shadows, their forms dissolving into the forest’s dark embrace. The silence returned, heavy and thick, the clearing empty save for the three of them, each of them catching their breath, their bodies tense with the memory of the shadows.

Talon’s legs gave out, and he sank to his knees, the medallion cold against his skin, his heart pounding in his chest. Sari knelt beside him, her hand on his shoulder, her gaze steady and filled with concern.

“Are you okay?”

He nodded, though he could barely keep his eyes open, the exhaustion settling over him like a fog. “I… I think so.”

Griffin’s voice was sharp, though edged with relief. “What were those things?”

Talon shook his head, his voice barely more than a whisper. “I don’t know. But… I think they’re part of the Veil. Or whatever’s guiding us.”

Sari looked out at the dark forest, her eyes hard, determined. “Then we’ll be ready next time. Whatever it takes.”

The silence settled over them, a quiet that felt both heavy and foreboding, a promise of the darkness yet to come. They were safe, for now. But each of them knew that this was only the beginning.
