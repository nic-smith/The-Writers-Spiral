Prologue: “Echoes of the Unbroken Cycle”

Talon was suddenly nowhere and everywhere, adrift in a landscape where ruin sprawled in every direction, endless and dark. The sky above him was split by a crimson light that poured down in sickly waves, illuminating twisted spires that jutted from the earth like broken teeth. Everything was desolation—a forgotten kingdom of shadow and silence, where every ruin whispered of horrors buried beneath the ground.

The air was thick with decay, the scent heavy and cloying, filling his lungs with a staleness that left him gasping. He could feel it in his bones, the age of this place, the weight of lives lost and memories bound to the ruins around him. And, in the distance, he saw it—a throne carved from the same blackened stone that littered the land, rising from the earth as if it were the land’s heart, bleeding shadows.

Seated upon it was Metis.

The figure’s form was vast and wrong, a thing that twisted as he looked at it, as though each glance revealed something new, something worse. Eyes and mouths appeared and disappeared within its shape, hollow sockets that flickered in and out of being, eyes of nothing but void. Its presence exuded a hunger that reached across the distance between them, touching Talon’s mind with a force that felt like fingers scraping against his skull.

He couldn’t look away. A deep, bone-deep dread held him in place, his gaze locked on Metis’s shifting form, feeling its darkness reach through him, finding every hidden fear, every suppressed memory. The medallion pulsed cold against his chest, like a heartbeat in reverse, pulling him toward the figure, binding him to this place, this fate.

*The cycle remains unbroken.*

The words echoed through him, not heard but felt, a dark whisper that vibrated through his bones, through the medallion, binding him tighter to the nightmare surrounding him. He clutched the medallion, its icy surface biting into his palm, but the cold felt endless, growing deeper, burrowing into him as though it wanted to become part of him.

Around him, shapes began to crawl from the ruins, skeletal figures that twisted and snapped, their limbs moving at impossible angles, dragging themselves across the ground toward the throne. Their faces were hollow, eyes dark as the void that pulsed within Metis. And yet, as they crawled, their heads turned to him, as though recognizing him, acknowledging his presence with a silent, dreadful awareness.

The medallion’s pull intensified, an insistent beat that matched the rhythm of his heart, a dark pulse that felt almost alive. Talon staggered, his vision blurring as he felt the medallion’s power seep into him, filling his veins with a chill that went beyond the physical, a cold that whispered of ruin and fate.

The figures continued to drag themselves forward, their movements synchronized, a broken and twisted procession that bound him to the throne, to Metis, to the prophecy that echoed within him. He felt his mind fray, slipping into the cold, into the darkness that seeped from the throne, filling his thoughts with fragments of shadows, of places long forgotten, of ruins that stretched beyond memory.

*Bound by ancient ruin,* the voice whispered, louder now, filling his mind, drowning out every thought. *A fate sealed in shadows. The ruin knows you.*

The words hammered against him, breaking through his thoughts, binding him to the vision with a force that felt almost physical. He tried to resist, to fight against the pull, but the medallion’s cold had settled into him, filling him, consuming him.

He could see it now—a hand, his own, bloody and reaching, grasping at a thread of light. But the light was fading, slipping through his fingers, lost to the shadows that encroached from every side, swallowing him whole.

And then, as the skeletal figures reached the base of the throne, their hollow faces tilted toward him, he felt a final pulse from the medallion, a pull that dragged him forward, binding him to the prophecy, to the fate he could not escape.

---

Talon gasped, snapping back to reality, his body drenched in cold sweat, the medallion searing against his chest.

The cold sweat still clung to his skin as Talon’s eyes adjusted, the darkness of his vision replaced by the dim shadows of the present. The medallion lay heavy against his chest, as if it had fused to him, its chill seeping into his bones, a reminder of the vision that had torn through him. His breathing was shallow, uneven, each breath a struggle to pull himself back into reality.

A soft sound broke the silence—a footfall, cautious and deliberate. Sari’s face emerged from the shadows, her lantern casting a faint glow that barely reached him, her eyes catching the light with a mixture of curiosity and concern. She watched him carefully, as though weighing the depth of whatever he’d just seen, her own expression a mask of calm, though Talon sensed something darker in her gaze, something she kept hidden.

“Talon.” Her voice was quiet, steady, but beneath it, he sensed a tremor of unease, an unspoken worry that mirrored his own. She stepped closer, her gaze drifting to the medallion as it lay against his chest, its cold, unyielding presence a silent participant in the conversation.

“You saw something, didn’t you?” she asked, her voice barely more than a whisper, a question that carried more weight than the words themselves.

He nodded, struggling to put the experience into words. “It was… Metis.” The name left a bitter taste on his tongue, heavy with the darkness he’d felt in the vision. “I saw ruins, endless ruins. A throne… and him. And those things—figures twisted and broken, all drawn to him. It felt like… like they knew me.”

Sari’s gaze flickered with recognition, but she quickly masked it, a practiced shift of expression that left him wondering how much she already knew, how much she had seen or felt herself. She took a steadying breath, nodding slowly. “The visions are growing stronger,” she murmured, as though speaking more to herself than to him. “It means we’re getting closer to something—something that won’t let us go until we face it.”

Talon’s chest tightened at the words. “Closer to what? To ruin? To him?” The fear laced his voice, raw and unguarded, the echoes of the vision still lingering, binding him to the darkness that had seeped into his mind.

Sari looked away, her gaze scanning the forest, as though seeking answers in the shadows beyond the lantern’s light. When she finally spoke, her voice was soft, almost distant. “The ruin knows you. The ruin binds you.” She repeated the words from his vision, her tone carrying a weight of understanding that sent a chill down his spine.

He stared at her, a hollow realization settling into his bones. “How do you know those words?”

Her eyes met his, a flicker of something unreadable passing over her face before she answered. “I’ve heard them before. In fragments. Echoes from my own visions, maybe.” She hesitated, her fingers brushing the hilt of her blade, as though seeking comfort in its solidity. “Talon, sometimes knowing doesn’t give us control. Sometimes it’s a burden—a chain.”

He swallowed, the cold weight of her words pressing down on him, grounding him in a way he hadn’t expected. For the first time, he saw in her a reflection of his own fears, his own struggle against the medallion’s unyielding pull. She, too, carried a weight, a knowledge that was as much a curse as it was a path forward.

Silence stretched between them, thick and tense, filled with the unspoken fears that lingered in the shadows. Talon could feel the weight of her words settle into him, a reminder of the prophecy that bound him, of the path that lay ahead, veiled in darkness and blood.

A subtle shift in the shadows caught his attention—a flicker of movement at the edge of his vision, something quick and silent, gone before he could fully register it. He looked over his shoulder, the sense of being watched prickling along his spine, but there was nothing there—only the silent stretch of trees, cloaked in darkness and mist.

“Sari…” he began, his voice trailing off, his gaze scanning the shadows, searching for something he couldn’t name. “Do you ever feel like… there’s something else? Watching us?”

Her expression hardened, her gaze sharpening as though she, too, sensed the unseen presence that seemed to hang over them. “Places like this don’t forget,” she replied, her tone edged with caution. “They’re filled with memories, fragments of things that once were. And sometimes, those things don’t stay buried.”

The words sent a chill through him, an unspoken warning that lingered in the air, heavy and oppressive. He felt the medallion pulse in response, a cold, relentless reminder that he was bound to this place, to the prophecy, to the fate that awaited him in the shadows.

She glanced back at the path, her voice quiet but firm. “Come on. The others are waiting, and we shouldn’t linger here.” She started walking, her steps cautious but steady, the fog swirling around her feet like a living thing, wrapping around her ankles and pulling at her cloak.

He followed, each step feeling like a descent into something darker, something that didn’t want them there. The forest around them seemed to shift, the trees bending closer, the shadows thickening, as though drawn to the medallion, to the prophecy that pulsed within it.

In the distance, he caught a glimpse of faint shapes within the fog, twisted and broken, almost human but distorted, silent witnesses to the path he’d chosen.

The fog closed in thicker as Talon and Sari moved forward, shrouding the forest in a heavy veil that swallowed sound and stifled light. Each step felt slower, heavier, as though they were wading through a place that held its own gravity, something ancient pulling them deeper into its grasp. The medallion lay cold and immovable against Talon’s chest, each pulse matching the beat of his heart, a reminder of the prophecy that bound him to this path.

Ahead of them, the trees grew gnarled and twisted, their limbs interlocking overhead, creating a canopy that blocked even the faintest glimmers of moonlight. Shadows moved between the trunks, dark shapes that seemed to shift and ripple as they passed, figures that felt alive, aware, yet indistinct—barely more than memories of things that had once roamed these woods.

Sari’s pace slowed, her eyes scanning the darkened path, her hand resting on the hilt of her blade. Talon watched her, sensing her unease, the tension that ran beneath her calm exterior. She seemed attuned to the forest in a way he couldn’t quite understand, as if she knew its secrets, as if the shadows whispered to her as they did to him.

They reached a clearing, a place where the fog lifted slightly, revealing a circle of stones jutting from the ground, their surfaces covered in the same twisted symbols he had seen in his vision. The stones were tall, weathered by time and the elements, each one carved with lines and curves that seemed to pulse with a faint, eerie glow. It was a place that felt untouched by time, preserved in its own dark eternity.

Sari’s eyes moved over the stones, her face pale in the dim light. “This place…” Her voice was barely a whisper, filled with a strange reverence. “It’s older than anything we’ve seen. These symbols—they’re warnings.”

Talon felt the medallion pulse harder, the cold seeping deeper into his bones, filling him with a sense of purpose and dread. He moved closer to one of the stones, his fingers grazing its rough surface, feeling the grooves of the symbols, their meaning hidden yet familiar, fragments of his vision threading through his mind.

As his hand touched the stone, a sharp pain shot through him, a flash of something ancient and violent. Images flooded his mind—a throne shrouded in shadows, a sea of faces twisted in silent screams, and Metis’s hollow gaze piercing through the dark, locking onto him with a recognition that sent a shiver down his spine.

He staggered back, clutching the medallion, its pulse now an insistent beat, a rhythm that matched the heartbeat of the forest, of the shadows that surrounded them.

Sari steadied him, her eyes searching his face, her concern barely masked. “What did you see?”

He swallowed, the words coming slowly, thick with the weight of the vision. “It’s Metis… the prophecy. It’s like it’s all bound here, waiting.” He looked at the stones, at the twisted symbols that seemed to writhe beneath his gaze, alive with a dark energy that pulsed in time with the medallion.

Sari’s face tightened, her gaze shifting between him and the stones, understanding and fear mingling in her eyes. “The medallion is pulling you here, tying you to this place.”

He nodded, feeling the weight of her words settle into him, binding him further to the prophecy, to the dark fate that awaited him. The symbols on the stones seemed to pulse, growing brighter, a silent acknowledgment of the medallion’s presence, a welcome he hadn’t asked for.

A faint, rhythmic sound echoed through the clearing, a low hum that vibrated through the air, filling the silence with a resonance that felt both familiar and foreign. It was a heartbeat, muffled and distorted, seeping from the stones, from the ground itself, filling his mind with the same cold, unyielding energy that pulsed from the medallion.

The shadows around them shifted, thickening, drawing closer, and Talon could feel the presence of something watching, waiting, its gaze heavy and unblinking. He felt exposed, laid bare before whatever force lay bound within this place, a force that recognized him, acknowledged him as part of the prophecy, a part of the cycle.

Sari’s hand tightened on her blade, her gaze fixed on the shadows, her posture tense. “We’re not alone here.”

Talon’s grip on the medallion tightened, the cold seeping deeper into him, sharpening his senses, filling his mind with fragments of the vision—the throne, the skeletal figures, the ruin. He could feel it now, the prophecy pressing down on him, binding him to this place, to the stones, to the dark presence that lingered in the shadows.

A faint whisper brushed against his mind, a voice soft and ancient, filled with a knowledge that defied time. *Bound by ancient ruin, a fate sealed in shadows. The ruin knows you.*

The words reverberated through him, echoing in his bones, a reminder of the fate he could not escape, a fate that had been written long before he had ever touched the medallion. He felt himself drawn to the center of the stone circle, the shadows pressing in, thick and heavy, filling his mind with a dark energy that pulsed in time with the heartbeat of the forest.

Sari’s voice was a quiet plea, pulling him back from the darkness. “Talon, don’t let it consume you.”

He looked at her, the weight of the prophecy heavy in his gaze, the medallion’s pulse relentless, binding him to the stones, to the shadows, to the fate that awaited him. But her presence grounded him, anchoring him against the dark pull that threatened to consume him.

Together, they stepped back from the stones, the medallion’s pulse fading slightly, its pull weakening as they moved out of the clearing, the shadows lingering, watching, waiting.

As they disappeared into the fog, a final whisper echoed in his mind, soft but unyielding, a promise and a threat bound in one.

*The cycle remains unbroken.*
