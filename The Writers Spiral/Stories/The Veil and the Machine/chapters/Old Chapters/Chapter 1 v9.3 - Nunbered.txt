Chapter 1: Into the Unknown

#### **[P1]**
As the trio pushed deeper into the forest, the trees loomed over them like ancient sentinels, their gnarled branches intertwining to form a dense, oppressive canopy. The air thickened with the musty scent of damp soil and decaying foliage, pressing down on them like an oppressive weight. Talon felt the forest constrict around him, the shadows flickering and whispering secrets that danced just beyond his grasp, stirring a sense of foreboding in his gut.

#### **[P2]**
Griffin’s breaths were sharp, slicing through the silence with irritation. “We’ve been wandering for hours, and this medallion isn’t leading us anywhere. Are we just going in circles?” His eyes darted nervously between the looming trees, unease creeping into his tone as the forest seemed to close in, branches twisting like fingers ready to ensnare them.

#### **[P3]**
Sari remained silent, her expression set and focused, flicking her gaze between the undergrowth and Talon’s back. She held one blade at her side and the other in her right hand, using them to cut through patches of thick grass and tangled vines that blocked their path.

#### **[P4]**
“We need to find a place to rest,” Sari proposed, her gaze falling on her nearly depleted water supply. “We have to locate a source soon. I packed enough for two days, but we’ve been lost for nearly four. If we don’t find something before it’s too late…” Her voice trailed off, the weight of unspoken fears heavy in the air, thickening the tension among them.

#### **[P5]**
Talon clenched the medallion in his pocket, feeling its cool surface against his palm. He opened his mouth to try to explain what he really didn't understand himself, but his breath hitched at the first word, making only a small shuddered sound.

#### **[P6]**
Griffin’s frustration bubbled over, a mix of skepticism and urgency in his voice. “So what now, Talon? You’re still not telling us what this vision was about. What are we even looking for here? Are we just chasing phantoms in this overgrown maze?” He scanned the trees with apprehension, the encroaching wilderness a reminder of their perilous situation.

#### **[P7]**
“It’s supposed to guide us,” Talon replied with no conviction in his tone as uncertainty gnawed at his resolve. The force propelling him forward was something he couldn’t fully articulate. The power he felt in the medallion was wholly new to him. The memories of his father’s stories about the heirloom echoed in his mind—the tales of its power and how it could reveal hidden truths. Until recently, they were just stories. He had scarcely worn it until his dad's funeral, but on that day, the medallion had come to life in his mind and soul. Now, it felt more like a burden than a blessing—a call he couldn't ignore.

#### **[P8]**
“Maybe we should take a break and regroup,” Sari suggested, glancing at her dwindling water supply. “We need to find water soon, or we will have bigger problems. I only packed enough for two days, but we’ve been lost for nearly four. If we don’t find something soon…” Her voice trailed off, the unspoken worry heavy in the air.

#### **[P9]**
Talon didn’t turn around. His grip tightened on the medallion hanging from his neck, fingers tracing the familiar grooves as if seeking reassurance. The pull at his soul was strong, a steady pulse that felt like it was guiding him through the darkness. But he knew how it must look to Griffin—stumbling blindly through the forest, chasing shadows.

#### **[P10]**
“It’s this way,” he said quietly, the certainty in his voice betraying the uncertainty he felt inside. He didn't mean to ignore Sari's suggestion, but he couldn't bear to sit and watch Griffin stew.

#### **[P11]**
The vision he had the night of the funeral was still fresh in his mind, its images flickering in his thoughts like shards of a broken dream. He couldn’t explain why he felt drawn to this place, only that he did. And he knew, deep down, that turning back was not an option.

#### **[P12]**
Griffin muttered something under his breath, his frustration barely contained. “We’re low on food, low on sleep, and you’re leading us who knows where, following… that thing.” His gaze flicked to the medallion, his expression hard.

#### **[P13]**
Sari glanced back at Griffin, her voice calm but firm. “We agreed to follow Talon’s lead, Griffin. Whatever he’s feeling, there’s a reason we’re here.” She moved past a thick patch of brambles, carefully lifting a branch out of her way. “Maybe… maybe there’s something we’re supposed to find.”

#### **[P14]**
Griffin’s expression didn’t soften, but he held his tongue, casting a wary look at the forest around them. “Fine,” he muttered, though his voice was heavy with doubt. “But this place… it feels wrong. Like we’re not supposed to be here.”

#### **[P15]**
The silence that followed his words was thick, pressing down on them like a weight. Talon felt the tension settle into his shoulders, the pressure of Griffin’s mistrust gnawing at his resolve and pulling weakly at his knees. He didn’t know how to explain it to Griffin, didn’t know how to make him understand that this was more than just a feeling. It was a pull, a call—something he couldn’t ignore even if he wanted to.

#### **[P16]**
They walked in silence, each of them lost in their own thoughts, the forest closing in tighter with every step. The light filtering through the canopy was thin and pale, casting long, twisted shadows that stretched across the forest floor like skeletal fingers. Talon’s steps slowed as the path grew more treacherous, the ground uneven and littered with roots that seemed to reach up from the earth to trip them.

#### **[P17]**
Sari was the first to stumble, her foot catching on a hidden root. Her neck and shoulder smacked hard against the bark of a tree, bounded off of before catching herself. A small scream escaped from her lungs as she hit the ground off the rebound. Without betraying the pain, she dug her blade into the ground to steady herself, her hand gripping the hilt tightly. “Watch your step,” she warned, but it was too late. She glanced back at Griffin, who muttered a curse as he tripped on the same root and narrowly avoided a collision with her. She limped forward into a walk again, then reached up to wipe the blood off the cut on her neck.

#### **[P18]**
Talon glanced back, catching the brief flicker of frustration on Griffin’s face that was compounded by the near collision with Sari. His face betrayed him before he quickly masked it with a scowl. They were all tired, worn down by days of travel, their supplies dwindling and their patience running thin. The medallion’s pull was the only thing driving Talon forward, and even he was beginning to feel the weight of doubt pressing down on him.

#### **[P19]**
Griffin’s voice broke the silence again, his tone low and edged with frustration. “You still haven’t told us exactly what you saw in that vision, Talon. All we know is that you felt something… calling you here. But what are we supposed to find?”

#### **[P20]**
Talon hesitated, feeling the cool weight of the medallion against his chest as fragmented visions surged through his mind. He was transported back to his childhood bedroom, the echoes of grief still fresh from his father’s passing. In this surreal reverie, time stretched infinitely; the world around him faded into nothingness. Scenes flashed before his eyes—ancient structures bathed in a green glow, their outlines shimmering with an otherworldly light. Hollow eyes stared back at him from the depths of a swirling purple sky, their gaze both haunting and familiar.

[P20.1]As the vision deepened, he shuddered at the sound of a voice calling his name—one that felt both close and distant, like a memory just out of reach. Then his father appeared, holding the glowing medallion out to him, a gesture that felt like the passing of a heavy legacy. In an instant, his father’s face morphed into that of a warrior, adorned with tribal markings and war paint. His body battle-worn, etched with scars; his eyes reflecting the weight of earned wisdom.

#### **[P21]**
He came to lying half off his bed, one leg over the foot of the bed and half his body askew over the side. The vision brought panic like he had never experienced. He rolled over, falling to the floor and retching. He recalled the frantic call to Sari moments after the vision. He lunged up from the ground, still choking from the vomit, and ran for his phone. Her voice on the other end was his lifeline. He panicked and balled, this voice coming in gasps. Her voice on the other end was a lifeline. "Talon, I'm here, and you are safe. Listen to my voice and breathe deep. Are you OK?" she asked as his gasping turned to choking.

#### **[P22]**
“I don’t know,” he choked, his voice barely more than a whisper. He held his breath in vain to calm his nerves. He stammered through parts of the vision and sped through others. Lost to what he was saying, Sari reached into his soul with practiced poise, saying what he needed to hear. "Talon, listen to my voice," she stated again and focused on breathing deep. Moments passed, and his gasps turned to slow breaths. "Something happened..." Talon exclaimed. "Talon, stay on the phone with me. I am on my way."

#### **[P23]**
She drove the five minutes to his house, and they spent all night into early morning pouring over the vision. Then she lay next to him, stroking his hair until he finally fell asleep.

#### **[P24]**
Talon shook his head to get the dazed cobwebs out of his mind, the memory of that night just a few weeks back fading into the real world. It had been some time since Griffin had asked about the vision, assuming that Talon was ignoring him. By the time Talon answered, he simply said, "The vision was... hard to explain. It just gives me a... a feeling, I guess."

#### **[P25]**
Griffin paused, trying to remember the question he asked, then scoffed, his gaze hardening. “That’s it? A feeling? We’re out here, risking our lives, low on food, following a feeling?”

#### **[P26]**
Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s shoulder, her touch grounding him. “It’s more than just a feeling, Griffin,” she said softly, though there was a hint of uncertainty in her own voice. “Talon wouldn’t have led us here if he didn’t believe there was a reason.”

#### **[P27]**
Talon felt the weight of Griffin’s words settle over him, a chain tightening around his mind. Every day removed from the vision brought his resolve down, and each step through these woods made the doubt grow heavier. Doubt wrapped tighter around his chest, restricting his breaths. He wanted to believe in the medallion’s pull, but fear gnawed at the edges of his resolve.

#### **[P28]**
Sari felt it too—his fear, like a tremor reaching across an invisible thread that bound them. She stepped closer, her voice quiet but unshakable. “Talon,” she murmured, “fear is a chain; courage breaks it.” She met his gaze, her expression steady. “Trust what you feel. We’re here because you believe in this path—and I believe in you.”

#### **[P29]**
Griffin scoffed, frustration etched into his features. “Belief doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. We need food, shelter, something tangible to hold on to. Right now, it feels like we’re grasping at straws.”

#### **[P30]**
The weight of his words settled over them, a cold reminder of their dwindling resources and the uncertainty that lay ahead. But Talon couldn’t shake the pull of the medallion, the feeling that they were on the brink of something vast and concealed, just beyond the edge of perception.

#### **[P31]**
As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, the forest grew darker, the shadows lengthening and merging into a solid wall of black. The air felt heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves, and Talon found it harder to breathe, as if the forest itself was pressing down on them, tightening around them like a noose.

#### **[P32]**
“We need to make camp while we still have light,” Griffin said bluntly, but Talon caught sight of something in the distance. A shape that did not fit the pattern of the forest. He started to speed up toward the shape, leaving Griffin and Sari to run to catch up.

#### **[P33]**
Just as they caught up to him, he broke into a run. Sari, jogging behind him, finally saw what he saw and broke into a joyful giggle. “Is that…?” she exclaimed just as Talon came to a sudden halt.

#### **[P34]**
The oppressive doubt he felt inside melted away, replaced by a giddy fervor. Half-hidden by twisted branches and thick undergrowth stood a rundown old cabin, alone and decaying, its walls warped and broken in places, its roof sagging under the weight of time.

#### **[P35]**
Sari let out a breath, her voice filled with a mixture of relief and caution. “Is that…?”

#### **[P36]**
Talon nodded, his heart pounding as he took a step closer. “Looks like shelter.”

#### **[P37]**
Griffin’s expression was unreadable as he moved forward, scanning the area around the cabin with a wary gaze. “Or a trap,” he muttered, his voice barely more than a whisper.

#### **[P38]**
But even as he spoke, Talon felt a strange sense of familiarity, as though the cabin had been waiting for them all along, hidden deep within the forest’s dark embrace.

#### **[P39]**
As they reached the cabin’s entrance, a chill ran down Talon’s spine. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were crossing a threshold, stepping into a place that was both sanctuary and prison.

#### **[P40]**
Pushing open the door, Talon stepped inside, the musty air wrapping around them like a thick blanket. Dust motes danced in the slanting light that filtered through the cracked windows. It was as if they were entering a forgotten world, one that held the secrets of the past and the promise of the unknown.
