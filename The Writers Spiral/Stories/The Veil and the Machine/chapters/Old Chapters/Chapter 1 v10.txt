Chapter 1

The forest loomed over them, a tangled maze of branches and shadows. The sun barely pierced the thick canopy, casting a dim, muted light that made everything feel damp and close. Talon moved ahead, his fingers brushing against the medallion at his chest, feeling the faint warmth that seemed to pulse beneath his touch, guiding him forward. Every step felt heavier as though the weight of his vision was pulling him deeper into something he couldn’t fully grasp.

Griffin trailed close behind, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. The blade, as familiar as his own heartbeat, felt reassuring under his grip, an anchor amid the shadowy vastness of the forest. He shot a look at Talon, frowning. "So, we’re just wandering out here, following a… what exactly, Talon?"

Talon hesitated, his mind flashing briefly to Dominic’s journal, to the frantic scrawl that had hinted at a pull, a need that even Dominic hadn’t understood. *The shadows hold something we don’t see… something I can’t resist.* He shook the thought away, focusing instead on the medallion’s subtle warmth, the way it felt like a gentle tug from an invisible thread.

“It’s more than a ‘what,’ Griffin,” Talon replied, trying to sound assured, though the words felt shaky. “I can feel… I don’t know, it’s like something is drawing us forward. I don’t have the words for it.”

Griffin let out a skeptical huff, his hand gripping his sword a little tighter. “You’re feeling pulled? That sounds like Dominic’s journal. And he ended up… well, we know how that turned out.” His gaze flicked to Talon’s chest, where the medallion rested under his shirt. “How do we know it’s even safe to trust that thing?”

Sari slipped between them, her tone measured and calm. “Griffin, enough. Talon had the vision, and we agreed to trust him, remember? Besides, arguing isn’t getting us anywhere.”

Talon offered her a grateful nod, though Griffin’s mistrust lingered, a quiet presence that pressed on him as surely as the humid air. He looked away, his fingers tracing the edges of the medallion, feeling its heat seep into his skin. For a moment, the vision came back to him—the shadowed figure, the strange, hollow eyes watching him, silently judging. He pushed the memory back, feeling a faint chill ripple over him despite the heat.

“We entered somewhere near Parque de Santiago,” Talon said finally, glancing back at the two of them. “If we keep heading in this direction, we’ll eventually hit the foothills. That’s… that’s where I think we’re supposed to go.”

Griffin’s expression hardened, his eyes narrowing. “So we’re just wandering until this ‘feeling’ leads us somewhere specific? That sounds solid.”

“Trust isn’t easy out here, I get it,” Sari said, turning to face Griffin, her voice softening. “But it’s better than standing still.” She gave him a small smile, something between reassurance and a challenge.

Griffin grunted, but his hand fell from the hilt of his sword, and he gave a slight nod. They walked in silence after that, the sounds of the forest filling the void. The air was thick with the hum of insects and the occasional rustle of unseen creatures, all blending together in a rhythm that was both foreign and strangely constant.

Talon’s thoughts drifted back to Dominic’s journal, to entries he hadn’t yet shared. *The Veil has a darkness, one that holds more than I can see… I fear it more each day.* The words had stuck with him, an ominous thread that he couldn’t pull free from. He knew Griffin would question every word if he shared too much, and he wasn’t ready to show them the shadowed side of what Dominic had left behind. Not yet.

As they trudged through the undergrowth, Griffin let out an exasperated sigh, reaching back for his sword. He didn’t draw it but kept his hand on the hilt, as though waiting for something to emerge from the shadows. “You know, I wouldn’t mind knowing what exactly we’re up against. If this thing in the journal—the ‘Veil’ or whatever—was so dangerous, maybe you should clue us in.”

Talon felt a pang of guilt, his fingers instinctively curling around the medallion. He could almost feel the pulse beneath his touch, a quiet echo of Dominic’s warnings, of his descent. “It’s not about knowing everything,” he said slowly. “Sometimes… it’s about trusting what you feel.”

Griffin’s mouth twisted, but he said nothing, turning back to the path with a resigned shake of his head. Sari gave Talon a supportive glance, her gaze lingering as if to say, *I’ve got your back.*

They continued, the forest stretching out endlessly before them, the light fading as the sun dipped lower. And as they moved deeper, Talon could feel the pull of the medallion grow stronger, a silent, insistent guide that seemed to draw them into the shadows.

They moved deeper into the forest, the canopy thickening above them, turning daylight into an endless twilight. Each step felt heavier, and the underbrush seemed to close in tighter, slowing their progress. Talon could feel the medallion’s pull, faint but persistent, a quiet guide in the otherwise silent woods.

Griffin muttered to himself, his hand never straying far from his sword. His fingers drummed against the hilt, a habit that Talon had seen before—Griffin’s version of a safety net, something to ground him in moments of unease. It was a subtle thing, but Talon could see the doubt etched in his friend’s expression, the silent question that hovered between them.

Sari, walking at Talon’s side, broke the silence. “Have you read more of the journal, Talon? I mean… there’s more in there than what you’ve told us, right?”

Talon hesitated, his hand brushing over the journal tucked in his pack. He had read further, seen Dominic’s words spiral into fear and paranoia, watched his writing grow erratic as he struggled to understand the Veil’s pull. But the parts he hadn’t shared felt like shadows, things that might cast doubts he wasn’t ready to face.

“Yeah, I’ve read some,” he said carefully, choosing his words as though handling fragile glass. “Dominic… he struggled with the Veil piece he had. He felt like it was leading him somewhere, but he wasn’t sure if he could trust it.”

Griffin’s eyes narrowed, catching the faint tremor in Talon’s voice. “And we’re supposed to just trust it? Based on some guy’s notes and a gut feeling?”

Talon looked away, his fingers tightening around the medallion. Memories of his vision flashed in his mind—the hollow eyes, the strange whispers, things that felt more like warnings than guidance. “It’s more than just a feeling, Griffin. The vision… it was clear. This path, this place—it’s where we’re supposed to be.”

“Supposed to be, huh?” Griffin’s voice held a bitter edge, his grip tightening on his sword. “Just because Dominic thought he was meant for something doesn’t mean it ended well. You’ve read the whole thing, right? You know he lost his mind.”

Talon felt the words pierce through his resolve, the reminder of Dominic’s fate echoing in his mind. *The Veil is no protection—it consumes. Each day I feel it pulling me further, until I don’t know what’s left of me.* He’d read those lines, felt the chill of Dominic’s fear, but sharing them aloud felt like letting the shadows in.

“He was afraid, yeah,” Talon said finally, trying to keep his voice steady. “But he kept going. Whatever he felt, whatever the Veil was showing him, it was bigger than his fear.”

Sari’s gaze softened as she looked at him, sensing the conflict he was trying to hide. “Sometimes fear is part of the path, Griffin. We’re here because we trust each other, right? We agreed to follow this.”

Griffin’s gaze flicked between them, a muscle in his jaw tightening. “Trust isn’t blind, Sari. And it’s not asking much to want a real answer instead of… ‘It’s meant to be.’”

The words hung heavy between them, the silence stretching out until only the sounds of their footsteps and the forest’s muted hum remained. Talon glanced at Griffin, feeling the unspoken divide growing with each step, the weight of Dominic’s warnings pressing down on him.

They pressed onward, each lost in their own thoughts. The shadows grew longer, the air thicker, and the path seemed to twist and wind in ways that felt unnatural, as if the forest itself were shifting around them.

“Feels like we’re going in circles,” Griffin muttered, looking around, his grip on the sword tightening. “If that medallion’s supposed to lead us somewhere, it better get to the point.”

Talon forced a faint smile, though he felt the same unease settling over him. The medallion’s pull was there, but each step forward felt like stepping into a darker unknown, guided by nothing more than fragments of a vision and Dominic’s half-finished thoughts.

They broke through the thick brush and found themselves in a small clearing, the forest opening up around a dilapidated cabin that looked as though it had been forgotten by time. Moss crept up its wooden walls, and the roof sagged under the weight of years, branches draped over it like skeletal fingers.

Sari let out a breath of relief, her eyes scanning the structure. “Looks abandoned, but it’s better than another night out here.”

Griffin moved past her, hand still resting on his sword, his gaze sharp and untrusting. “Let’s hope whoever owned this place isn’t planning a return trip anytime soon.”

Talon approached slowly, feeling the medallion grow warmer against his chest as he neared the cabin. It was a subtle pulse, but enough to make him pause, sensing the strange familiarity of this place. He couldn’t explain it, but he knew, without a doubt, that they were meant to be here.

Griffin went inside first, his sword drawn as he scanned the shadowed interior. The air was stale, thick with dust and the faint scent of decaying wood. Talon followed, his gaze taking in the remnants of what must have once been a safe haven—a bed pushed against the wall, a wooden table with a single chair, and shelves lined with tattered books and rusted tools.

Sari stepped in behind them, her face softening as she looked around. “It’s… quiet. Almost peaceful.”

Talon placed his hand over the medallion, feeling its warmth pulse stronger, a reminder of Dominic’s journal. He pulled it out, flipping to the page where Dominic had written about a place hidden in the forest, a place he felt called to but could never fully explain.

*“It pulls me here, though I don’t know why. A part of me feels at rest, but another feels the shadow growing.”*

The words resonated, echoing in Talon’s mind as he looked around the cabin. This was it—the place Dominic had described. But the shadow he spoke of, the darkness he had felt… it lingered, as if etched into the very walls.

Griffin sheathed his sword and looked over, a hint of curiosity in his eyes. “So, does the journal say anything about this place?”

Talon hesitated, weighing his words. “He mentioned a place in the woods, somewhere he felt safe… but also somewhere that made him feel… different.” He glanced at Griffin, reluctant to reveal Dominic’s growing paranoia, the way he had felt watched, followed by shadows only he could see.

Sari moved closer, her gaze thoughtful as she studied him. “What kind of different?”

Talon swallowed, his fingers grazing the page, tracing the faded ink. “He said it felt like there was something here, something just beyond his reach. He couldn’t see it, but he felt it… watching.”

A silence settled over them, thick with unspoken tension. Griffin’s eyes darkened, suspicion flickering across his face. “So we’re sleeping in a haunted shack, is that it?”

Sari rolled her eyes, giving Griffin a playful shove. “Haunted or not, it’s dry. And it’s the best shelter we’ve had in days.”

They moved to set up their gear, each of them claiming a small corner of the cabin. Talon spread his cloak on the floor near the wall, leaning back and closing his eyes, though his mind remained alert. He could feel the weight of the medallion pressing against his chest, the warmth seeping into his skin, grounding him but also filling him with a sense of quiet unease.

As darkness settled in, the only sound was the soft rustling of leaves outside and the distant call of an owl. Talon glanced at the journal in his hands, the pages worn and weathered, filled with Dominic’s fragmented thoughts.

*“The Veil consumes. I took it from him by force, but it’s no protection… it’s a weight, one I’m not sure I can carry much longer.”*

The words lingered, a warning he hadn’t yet shared. He looked at Griffin and Sari, who were already settling down, their faces softened by exhaustion. He wanted to protect them, to shield them from the truth of what Dominic had hinted at, the darkness that seemed to bleed from the Veil’s power.

But as he held the journal, he knew that secrets, even those meant to protect, came with a cost.
