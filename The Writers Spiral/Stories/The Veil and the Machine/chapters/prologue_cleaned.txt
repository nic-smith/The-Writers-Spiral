Talon’s vision pulled him into a realm both hauntingly familiar and utterly alien. Silhouettes stretched across a landscape of jagged ruins, their forms distorted and sharp against the murky, oppressive sky. Symbols—ancient, indecipherable—glowed faintly across walls that seemed more like bones than stone, like markers from a civilization lost to time, or something far more disturbing. The symbols flickered, each pulse casting an eerie light that felt alive, pulsating with its own unsettling rhythm.

Its mere presence radiated a gloomy, cold energy that seeped into Talon’s bones. This figure wasn’t human; it was something vast, something that knew him without ever having met him, and the depth of its knowing sent a chill through his very soul.
