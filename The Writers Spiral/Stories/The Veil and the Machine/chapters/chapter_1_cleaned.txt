As the trio ventured deeper into the forest, the trees rose like ancient sentinels, their twisted branches knitting together overhead to form a dense, shadowy canopy. The air thickened with the damp scent of rotting leaves and soil, pressing down on them like a shroud. Talon felt the forest constricting around him, a dark weight settling into his chest. Shadows flickered at the edge of his vision, whispering secrets he couldn’t quite grasp, stirring a deep sense of unease.

Griffin’s breaths grew sharper, each exhale laden with irritation. “We’ve been wandering for hours,” he muttered, his voice tight with frustration. “This medallion isn’t leading us anywhere. Are we just walking in circles?” His eyes darted uneasily between the gnarled trees, his skepticism evident in every glance, as if the forest itself were mocking their efforts.

Sari walked with focused determination, her gaze flicking between the undergrowth and Talon’s back as she used her twin blades to slice through tangles of vine and thorn. “We need to rest,” she said, casting a glance at her dwindling water supply. “I packed enough for two days, but it’s been nearly four. If we don’t find water soon…” Her voice trailed off, worry lacing her words.

Talon clutched the medallion, its cool surface pressing into his palm, grounding him even as doubt gnawed at his resolve. “It’s supposed to guide us,” he murmured, though he felt the weakness in his own voice. His father’s stories of the medallion echoed in his mind, tales of its hidden power to reveal paths no one else could see. Until recently, those tales had felt like folklore, but now they weighed heavily, an inherited burden he couldn’t ignore.

Griffin let out a bitter sigh, slicing through the silence. “Supposed to? Talon, we’re just stumbling through this place, chasing a feeling.” His eyes narrowed, irritation shading into something closer to fear. “Your medallion better start showing us something real, or we’re in serious trouble.”

###[TO BE REWRITTEN]: Let's look at redoing P6-P7 to introduce Griffin's sword. In P6 Sari is clearing brush with a knife. Her anxiety is high and she is woried about their supplies. The group has been the in the woods longer than they thought they would be. Griffin is going to come in at this moment, pull his sword (which is a silly weapon to have on a trip through the forest) and he is going to hack at the underbrush with excess bravado. Sari, annoyed at his show of excess of over the top strength will use her dark sarcasm to ask him something like may I ask why on a trip thought the woods you decided to bring such an impractical weapon. Griffin will quip with something scarscastic explaining how the sword is not impractical. Then Sari will go back into her "Maybe we should regroup." statement. This whole thing should be light but dark sarcastic humor. It should bite but not be overly mean and it should also be somewhat memorible because we are introducing the sword which will become very improntant in the future. You can also add some body language or a huff from Talon.

The path ahead narrowed, winding as though the forest itself had reshaped to mislead them. Sari cleared a dense patch of vines, her eyes flickering with a hint of doubt. “Maybe we should regroup,” she suggested, her voice calm but edged with caution. “If we don’t find water soon, we’re going to be in worse shape.”

Ignoring her, Talon kept moving, clutching the medallion as though it held answers he couldn’t articulate. It was this way, he told himself, though desperation simmered beneath his resolve. He knew how it must look—three young wanderers, lost in an endless maze. But the medallion tugged at him, pulling him forward, deeper into the unknown. “This way,” he said quietly, more to himself than anyone else.

They pressed on, each lost in thought as the forest seemed to close in around them, shadows weaving along the path like silent witnesses. The air grew dense, heavy with a humid, electric charge that prickled against their skin—the kind that comes just before a downpour. A low rumble echoed in the distance, rolling through the trees and lingering, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. The sound hinted at a storm building, muted yet relentless, the Earth bracing to wash itself clean. Sari felt a chill creep up the back of her neck as the sound faded, a weight settling on her shoulders. Something was coming, she felt sure of it, but kept the thought to herself, unwilling to add to the unease already thick between them.

The medallion was a steady weight against Talon’s chest, cool and constant, as though reminding him of its silent pull. His mind drifted back to his father’s funeral, the moment he first felt its true weight. Until that day, the medallion had been nothing more than a family relic, a trinket tied to stories he hadn’t fully believed. But after his father’s passing, it had come alive, haunting his nights with fractured visions—glimpses of places he couldn’t recognize yet felt within him like buried memories.

He could almost hear his father’s voice, a steady murmur urging him forward, filling him with the sense that he wasn’t alone on this path. His father’s face, half-lost to time, resurfaced in his mind, his expression a blend of fierce determination and sorrow. Talon hadn’t understood it then, but now the medallion’s pull felt like a command—a responsibility too ancient to ignore.

A sudden, bone-chilling gust swept through the trees, and Talon’s vision fractured, plunging him back into an echo of the vision that had haunted him since his father’s funeral. He saw glimpses of shadowed structures wreathed in green mist, hollow eyes staring down from a sky tinged with a strange, unnatural purple. His father’s face appeared amid the chaos, eyes full of sorrow and warning as he clutched the medallion with a desperation Talon hadn’t understood. Talon reached out, heart pounding, but his father’s face twisted, morphing into that of a fierce, battle-scarred warrior, his skin etched with markings, his gaze blazing with ancient resolve.

Talon’s grip on the medallion tightened, grounding himself against the weight of the vision. The fractured images dissipated, but a prickle of unease lingered. He had seen this before—on the day of his father’s funeral, when the medallion had first called to him. The feeling it left behind was the same: an urgency he couldn’t shake, a pull into the unknown.

Talon forced a nod, though his mind lingered on the vision. He knew it was just a fragment—a reminder of what had set all of this into motion, the strange, elusive purpose pulling him forward. Whatever they were moving toward, it felt far more profound than a trek through the woods. He shook his head, the medallion’s weight growing heavier, its pulse pressing against his chest like a heartbeat out of sync. “I don’t know what any of this means,” he murmured, the words almost to himself, trying to give shape to the gnawing feeling inside. “But… we’re close. It’s like something’s been waiting, drawing us in.”

The humidity thickened, carrying a faint metallic tang—a warning of rain. A sudden gust rattled the branches above, and a chill seeped into Talon’s bones, drawing an involuntary shiver. He glanced up, catching a flicker of shadow moving through the canopy, an ominous darkness that seemed to watch, hovering just out of sight.

Before Talon could say more, Sari’s foot caught on a hidden root, pitching her forward. She collided with a tree, bark scraping against her shoulder. She hissed, pressing a hand to the fresh cut, where blood was already beginning to bead. “Watch it!” she snapped, her voice tight with pain.
Griffin stepped forward to steady her, his gaze flicking to Talon with a flash of frustration. “Damn it, Talon!” he spat, anger simmering beneath his words. “If this medallion of yours is just a wild goose chase…” He stopped, his words hanging in the air like a threat. “This isn’t a journey—it’s a death march.”

Talon stepped aside, casting a glance at the forest pressing in around them, then back to Sari’s fresh wound. A faint, reassuring smile played on his lips. “Stick with me,” he whispered a plea, his voice steady but soft. “I know this is crazy, but if we turn back now, all we’ll have are shadows and what-ifs. They say the only way out is through.” His words held a quiet weight, catching Sari’s attention as her gaze softened. Griffin only sighed, rolling his eyes, but the truth of it settled over them all. Whatever lay ahead, Talon knew, was waiting just beyond—hidden, but within reach.

Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s shoulder, her expression soft yet resolute. “Talon, you wouldn’t have brought us here without a reason,” she said, though there was a hint of uncertainty, as if she were trying to convince herself as much as him. Her hand lingered, a silent reminder of the trust she’d placed in him.

Griffin’s words lingered like a shadow over Talon, a weight pressing down on his resolve. Each day in the forest had chipped away at his confidence, every tangled step eroding the certainty he’d felt since that first vision. He wanted to believe in the medallion’s pull, but with each passing hour, doubt gnawed a little deeper.

Sari sensed his unease and stepped closer, her voice a whisper just for him. “Talon, courage and fear… they walk the same path,” she murmured. “Trust what you feel. We’re here because you believe in this journey—and I believe in you.” Her gaze held his, grounding him in a quiet steadiness he desperately needed.

Griffin shook his head, looking away. “Belief doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. Food does. Shelter does. And right now, we’re running low on both.” His words were a cold reminder of the reality pressing down on them, the practical dangers overshadowing the mysteries they were chasing.

The silence thickened, the weight of Griffin’s doubts hanging over them. Talon felt the medallion pulse against his chest, a steady beat urging him forward even as uncertainty gnawed at his thoughts. He forced himself to push the doubts aside, to trust in the pull that had brought them this far.

They trudged on, the forest growing darker as the light continued to fade. Shadows stretched across the ground, merging into the trees as though the forest itself were alive, watching them with unseen eyes. Talon’s steps quickened, his heart racing in time with the medallion’s pull, which seemed to grow more insistent with each passing moment.

“We need to make camp soon,” Griffin said, his voice flat with exhaustion. “We’re low on everything, and we’re not going to last much longer at this pace.” Talon heard the weariness in Griffin’s tone, the frustration replaced by fatigue, and he couldn’t ignore the toll the journey had taken on all of them.

“Feels like the air’s thick enough to bring rain, doesn’t it?” She glanced around, barely able to see the sky through the thick canopy but still feeling the damp weight of it pressing down.

Another low rumble echoed, rolling through the trees, louder this time, pressing against them from all directions. The sound wasn’t just thunder—it felt like the forest itself was groaning, straining under some unseen weight. The three paused, glancing up as the darkening sky flickered with distant lightning, casting the forest in brief, eerie flashes.

As the sun dipped lower, shadows pooled around them, merging into an unbroken wall of darkness. Talon was about to agree they should make camp when he saw it—a shape looming through the twisted branches and thick undergrowth. It was dark and hulking, half-hidden but unmistakable. His heart quickened, doubts and exhaustion momentarily forgotten. “There,” he whispered, moving toward it, forcing Sari and Griffin to follow.

As they drew closer, the shape solidified into a rundown cabin, leaning under the weight of creeping vines and age-worn wood. The roof sagged, and the warped walls seemed ready to collapse, as if burdened by years of neglect. Relief mingled with unease in Talon’s chest; the cabin felt unnatural, an interruption in the endless forest, waiting in silence for something—or someone.

Sari caught up, her eyes widening with a mix of relief and wariness. “Is that...?” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, as if speaking louder might make the vision vanish. The cabin stood as if watching them, its darkened windows like hollow eyes reflecting the fading light.

Griffin’s gaze swept the area around the cabin, lingering on its warped exterior. “Could be a trap,” he muttered, his hand tightening around the hilt of his knife. A damp gust stirred the stagnant air, carrying a faint, metallic tang that prickled his skin, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. He glanced up through the thinning canopy, catching sight of dark clouds gathering low—a promise of rain and something darker hovering just beyond reach.

Another crack of thunder, louder this time, rumbled through the forest, vibrating in the ground beneath them. The air turned colder, and scattered raindrops began to slip through the thick branches above, spattering against leaves and shoulders. The light dimmed as clouds gathered overhead, smothering the last traces of daylight. Sari exchanged a look with Talon, both feeling the storm’s encroaching threat—a force neither could ignore.

But Talon felt something different. As he stared at the cabin, a strange sense of familiarity washed over him, as though he had been here before—though he knew that was impossible. The medallion at his chest pulsed, its rhythm matching his heartbeat. This place held something for them, something hidden, something waiting just beyond their sight.

They stepped closer, each of them feeling the weight of the forest lift slightly, as if the cabin itself offered a reprieve from the oppressive shadows. The air around it was heavy, unsettlingly calm, and Talon’s skin prickled under the sensation of being watched, an invisible gaze tracking their every movement.

The forest finally gave way, opening into a small clearing, and for the first time, they could see the sky. Dark clouds gathered low, their edges bruised and heavy with an incoming storm. Sari’s unease solidified, but the promise of shelter kept her silent.

Griffin looked back at Talon, skepticism flickering with a faint, reluctant hope. “So, is this where the medallion’s been dragging us?” His voice was edged with bitterness, softened only by the fatigue etched into his face, as though even his frustration had grown weary.

Talon nodded slowly, feeling the medallion’s pull stronger than ever, urging him forward. He could see the strain in his friends’ faces—the doubts, the fear, and the exhaustion. “I don’t know what we’ll find,” he admitted, his voice steady but quiet. “But we didn’t come this far to turn back now.”
