#Talon Mercer
Origin: Born in Huejotzingo, Mexico, Talon descends from a family of Mayan heritage. His parents are archaeologists, dedicated to studying significant sites in Atlixco and Teotihuacán. Growing up surrounded by artifacts and ancient stories, Talon developed a deep connection to history and his cultural legacy.
The Medallion: A family heirloom passed down through 19 generations, the medallion became Talon’s responsibility during the Villa Iluminada festival in Atlixco. This event marked a pivotal moment in his life, binding him to the mysteries of his ancestry. While the medallion’s ancient inscription does not directly translate to "Veil," it carries a profound sense of purpose and secrecy. This artifact is central to Talon’s identity, embodying his lineage and the weight of untold stories.
Personality: Introspective and artistic, Talon channels his thoughts and emotions through sketching and journaling. While he embraces his heritage, the medallion’s enigmatic legacy weighs heavily on him, instilling both wonder and apprehension. Talon’s quiet resilience masks a persistent internal conflict, as he grapples with the medallion’s pull and the growing uncertainty of its purpose.
Visions: At age 16, Talon began experiencing fragmented visions of ruins, shadows, and cryptic warnings. These intensified after inheriting the medallion, culminating in a powerful vision that compelled him to enter the forest with Sari and Griffin. His visions are disjointed but vivid, often leaving him questioning their meaning while fueling his determination to uncover their origin.

#Sari Aydin
Origin: Born in Turkey, Sari immigrated to Wisconsin with her family as a child. Her upbringing blended Turkish traditions with the challenges of adapting to a new culture. Her parents fostered her love for art and storytelling, which later influenced her distinctive approach to combat and problem-solving. This duality in her identity—rooted in tradition yet open to exploration—shapes her empathetic and creative worldview.
Fighting Style: Sari’s combat techniques draw on her background in Turkish dance, combining fluidity, precision, and adaptability. Her movements are both elegant and effective, reflecting her ability to think creatively in high-pressure situations. Her discipline, honed through years of dance and martial practice, complements her artistic instincts, allowing her to improvise and adapt seamlessly.
Personality: Empathetic, resourceful, and resilient, Sari often serves as the emotional anchor for the trio. Her open-mindedness allows her to mediate conflicts, offering clarity and balance. Sari’s optimism and determination inspire those around her, though she occasionally struggles with self-doubt, masking it with her natural charisma.
Role in the Trio: As the group’s mediator and stabilizing force, Sari tempers Griffin’s skepticism and supports Talon’s conviction, ensuring the group remains unified despite challenges. Her intuition and emotional intelligence allow her to navigate the group’s dynamics effectively, earning the trust of both Talon and Griffin.

#Griffin Blake
Origin: Hailing from Milwaukee, Griffin has British or Irish roots. His father, a conservationist, exposed him to the outdoors early, teaching him survival skills and fostering a strong connection to nature. This upbringing instilled a sense of discipline and practicality, shaping Griffin into a protector and realist.
Swordsmanship: Griffin’s fascination with swords began when his father gifted him a simple replica during childhood. This sparked a lifelong interest in martial arts and combat, making him the group’s protector. Talon later deepened this connection by gifting Griffin a unique sword, purchased at great personal cost. The sword, unknowingly tied to the Veil, symbolizes Griffin’s role as both defender and skeptic.
Personality: Grounded and pragmatic, Griffin approaches situations with caution and logic. His protective instincts make him a reliable ally, but his distrust of mysticism—particularly Talon’s medallion—often creates tension within the group. Griffin’s skepticism is rooted in his desire to shield the group from perceived threats, though it sometimes blinds him to the possibilities Talon and Sari embrace.
Role in the Trio: Griffin acts as the realist and protector. His skepticism counters Talon’s faith in the medallion, ensuring their decisions are rooted in practicality. His loyalty to the group drives him to question anything that might endanger them, even at the cost of personal conflict.

#The Origins of Their Bond
Red Arrow Camp: The trio first met as preteens at Red Arrow Camp in Woodruff, Wisconsin. Talon attended during a summer stay with relatives, Griffin was a regular camper, and Sari’s family enrolled her to help her acclimate to life in the U.S. Shared experiences, from forest exploration to campfire storytelling, solidified their friendship. Their time at camp established the foundation for their dynamic—Talon’s introspection, Sari’s vivacity, and Griffin’s protective instincts.
Early Dynamics: Talon and Sari bonded over their mutual love for art and nature, while Griffin naturally took on the role of protector. Though Griffin’s practicality sometimes clashed with Sari’s independence, their differing personalities ultimately strengthened their bond. Together, they learned to navigate challenges, laying the groundwork for their future journeys.

#Shared Experiences
Camping Adventures: As teenagers, the trio deepened their friendship through annual camping trips. These adventures tested their resilience and teamwork, laying the foundation for their ability to face challenges together. The wilderness became their shared sanctuary, a place where their bond flourished amidst trials and triumphs.
The Medallion’s Revelation: During one of these trips, Talon shared the story of his family’s medallion. While Sari was intrigued by its mysticism, Griffin’s skepticism grew, foreshadowing future tensions. This moment marked a turning point in their dynamic, introducing the first hints of the medallion’s enigmatic power.
Move to Huejotzingo: Drawn by opportunities in Mexico and a desire to escape the encroachment of technology, their families relocated to Huejotzingo. The town’s rich cultural history and proximity to archaeological sites provided the trio with a new backdrop for their explorations. Their shared history and connection to the region’s traditions deepened their bond, setting the stage for their journey into the forest.

#The Sword and Talon’s Sacrifice
Talon’s gift of a sword to Griffin became a transformative event, strengthening their bond while introducing themes of sacrifice, trust, and mystery that would shape their journey. During one of his explorations in Huejotzingo, Talon was inexplicably drawn to a pawn shop where an ornate sword caught his eye. Its craftsmanship was exquisite, with intricate carvings and an almost otherworldly aura. Talon immediately recognized that the sword was perfect for Griffin, whose fascination with weaponry had been a defining trait since their early years. However, the sword’s price far exceeded anything Talon could afford.

Driven by a desire to honor Griffin’s loyalty and leadership, Talon made the difficult decision to sell the medallion—an irreplaceable family heirloom passed down for generations—to gather the necessary funds. This act of sacrifice was both impulsive and profound, reflecting Talon’s deep connection to his friends and his struggle to reconcile his heritage with his present reality.

After purchasing the sword, Talon was struck by the void left by the medallion’s absence. His immediate regret led him back to the pawn shop, only to discover that the medallion had already been sold to Eli Rivas, a reclusive yet perceptive figure in the community. Determined to reclaim the medallion, Talon approached Eli and found himself unexpectedly drawn into the older man’s world.

Mentorship and the Medallion’s Return
Eli Rivas, a retired entrepreneur with a passion for historical artifacts, quickly discerned the medallion’s significance to Talon. Rather than simply selling it back, Eli offered Talon work tending to his property, using the opportunity to impart lessons about integrity, patience, and the value of meaningful sacrifices. Through weeks of labor and introspection, Talon grew to understand not only the medallion’s importance but also the broader implications of his actions and responsibilities.

Eventually, Eli returned the medallion to Talon, acknowledging his growth and resilience. This experience became a turning point for Talon, embedding in him a deeper sense of purpose and a renewed appreciation for his heritage.

The Gift’s Impact on Griffin
When Talon presented the sword to Griffin, the gesture resonated deeply, symbolizing their shared loyalty and mutual respect. Unbeknownst to either of them at the time, the sword held a fragment of the Veil, adding layers of significance to their journey. Griffin’s initial wariness of the medallion was tempered by his gratitude, though his skepticism toward its mystical nature remained a source of tension within the group.

This moment encapsulated the trio’s dynamic—Talon’s introspective determination, Griffin’s pragmatic caution, and Sari’s ability to mediate and anchor their relationship. The sword, as a symbol of sacrifice and connection, became a pivotal artifact in their shared narrative, foreshadowing its greater role in the unfolding mystery of the Veil.

#The Journey into the Forest
The Vision: Talon’s final vision compelled the trio to enter the forest. It revealed cryptic scenes of darkness, ruin, and a distant light connected to the medallion, suggesting an ancient power hidden within the wilderness. Talon’s conviction was unwavering, though Griffin’s skepticism and Sari’s mediation were pivotal in the group’s decision to follow him. The vision, though fragmented and unsettling, served as a catalyst, driving them toward an uncertain destiny.
Tensions Within the Group: The journey was fraught with challenges. Griffin’s mistrust of the medallion and his doubts about Talon’s vision created friction, testing their bond. Sari’s role as peacemaker was crucial in maintaining unity, balancing Griffin’s realism with Talon’s conviction.
Provisions and Survival: Leaving Huejotzingo with hastily packed supplies, the trio faced the uncertainty of their mission. Their survival depended on their ability to navigate the forest’s dangers and rely on one another. The forest, both a physical and symbolic trial, mirrored the complexities of their relationship and their individual struggles.
