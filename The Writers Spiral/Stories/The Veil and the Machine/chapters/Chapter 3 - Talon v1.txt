Sleep doesn’t come for me anymore. Not really. I lie down, close my eyes, but rest never follows. My body feels like it’s betraying me, stiff and aching from days of this relentless journey. The medallion whispers like a second heartbeat, thrumming in my chest, its pull as constant and unrelenting as gravity. Now this journal. Now this perfect spiral into madness written in a phantasmagoria daze. I can feel the Veil draw on my soul as I pour through its pages. The medallion led us here. I wish I could forget... forget... forget. It wants me to move, to keep going, even now while the others are asleep. Especially now.

Griffin is sprawled out near the far wall, his snoring filling the cabin like a low, ceaseless grumble. Even in sleep, he manages to irritate me. I love him, but his endless complaining cuts through me in a way that leaves wounds. He’s not wrong—this place is madness wrapped in misery—but his constant negativity gnaws at what little resolve I have left. The guilt pooling in my gut churns, threatening to spill over, and his attitude makes it harder to keep myself from unraveling completely. His sleeping bag is twisted around him, a cocoon of warmth that seems to mock my restlessness.

Sari... She’s tucked into her sleeping bag near the fireless hearth, her silhouette barely visible in the faint light that filters through the cabin’s cracks. Her face is calm, beautifully peaceful, like a fleeting memory of a time untouched by this madness. She’s not just my anchor—she’s everything. My driving force. The one steady point in a world that feels like it’s crumbling around me. She isn’t just my friend; she’s my purpose, the reason I haven’t given in to the pull of the medallion entirely. And yet, I feel guilt, sharp and unrelenting, because I’m dragging her into something she doesn’t deserve.

Reluctant, dark envy creeps in, though I know it’s ridiculous. Her strength, her intellect—it feels almost unfair how effortlessly she embodies those qualities. Her beauty, too, is unmatched, a quiet radiance that draws people to her without her even trying. I know deep down that if we hadn’t met at that summer camp all those years ago, she would’ve never had a reason to be my friend. She’s the one who should be leading us. It’s her.

But she doesn’t feel the pull. The medallion chose me, for reasons I’ll never understand, and it refuses to let go, even in the moments I wish it would.

The cabin feels like a tomb, the air pressing down on me with a weight that claws at my chest. Every creak of the damp wood whispers a reminder of how fragile this place is, how fragile we are. But I can’t focus on it, not really. I can’t let myself. If I let it in—if I let the thought settle in my mind—I’ll shatter. And shattering isn’t an option. Not now. Not ever.

The journal reposes on the floor by my head. It landed there when I fell asleep—if I even slept. Closed tightly as if to trap its secrets. I’ve read those pages so many times I don’t need to look at them; they’re burned into my memory. But even now, in the silence, the vision crawls back into my mind, as vivid and unrelenting as the medallion’s pull. My stomach tightens, and the air in the cabin feels thinner, harder to pull into my lungs. It’s the reason I’m here, dragging Sari and Griffin into this.

I saw it before we left—clearer than any dream, more vivid than anything I’d ever experienced. The medallion seared against my palm, its hum vibrating through my bones, pulling me into a place that felt ancient and alive, as though the world itself had opened a wound. I was standing in a jungle, the air oppressive with heat and thick with the sound of creatures moving unseen. Ahead of me was the temple: colossal, weathered, and alive in a way no building should be. Vines crawled up its stone walls, pulsing like veins feeding a beating heart, and the moss-covered steps seemed to vibrate under my gaze. It wasn’t just old; it was waiting.

Inside, the air shifted. It was colder, sharper, carrying whispers that pressed against my skin. They weren’t words, but emotions: anger, desperation, despair. And something else—a presence at the edges of my mind, vast and formless, watching from the shadows. It wasn’t the Veil, but it was connected, like a puppeteer pulling unseen strings. The hallways twisted unnaturally, narrowing and darkening until it felt like the temple itself was alive, shifting to swallow me whole.

And then I saw it: the Veil. Suspended in a shaft of light that cut through the blackness, it radiated power. It wasn’t just an object; it was alive, aware. Its presence filled the room, demanding submission from everything around it, including me. I felt it watching, studying, like it already knew everything I’d ever been and everything I could be. And then the visions came.

Blood. Sari’s. Griffin’s. Mine. Thick and glistening, pooling across the cold stone floor in sluggish rivers that reflected the unnatural light of the Veil. The light from the Veil reflected in pools of red that grew larger, swallowing the room. My chest felt hollow, as though the life had been ripped from me, leaving behind only the searing pull of the medallion in my hand.

I look back at the journal, at the spidery handwriting scrawled across the yellowed pages. The words feel alive, like they’re writhing just beneath the surface, daring me to read them again. One line in particular won’t leave me alone: “The path to the temple is the path to madness, but it is also the only path to salvation.” That was the last line in the journal. Or it’s the last line before Dominic tore out the last pages.

I don’t know what that means, not fully, but I feel it in my bones. This isn’t just a journey—it’s a reckoning. And if I tell Sari and Griffin, if I let them see how broken I already am, they’ll leave. Or worse, they’ll try to stop me, and I can’t let that happen. I’d rather lose my mind completely than lose them, even if it means dragging them deeper into the madness.

The medallion hums against my chest, its pulse uneven now, erratic, as if it senses the memory forcing its way to the surface. I wrap my fingers around it, its unnatural warmth radiating into my palm like it’s alive, reacting to my thoughts. I watch the green shadows on the wall dance as I open and close my fist. It’s beautiful, in a way that feels wrong, like it’s mocking me for being so entranced by it. I run my thumb over the edge, and the hum grows louder, sharper. It’s not just a pull anymore. It’s a command.
