The air was thick and heavy, each step dragging them deeper into the oppressive heat of the forest. The storm had broken, but its remnants clung to the trees, beads of water slipping from branches and pooling on the forest floor. With every step, the mud sucked at their boots, slowing them down, as if the forest itself were reluctant to let them pass.

“Feels like walking through a swamp,” Griffin muttered, slapping at the cloud of mosquitoes that buzzed relentlessly around him. He grimaced, wiping the sweat from his brow, his usual composure cracking under the barrage of bites. “I swear these things have been waiting for us.”

Talon gave a weak smile, the medallion’s weight pulling heavily at his neck as he adjusted it under his shirt. It was warm against his chest, like a sunbeam that wouldn’t fade, a constant reminder of the vision that had led them here. He tried to focus on the familiar pull, on the sense of purpose that had driven him into the forest, but Griffin’s grumbling broke through his concentration.

But the forest was unyielding, each step forward feeling heavier as they moved deeper into its shadowed heart. The ground grew steeper, the mud thicker, and the air somehow even more stifling.

“Parque de Santiago,” he murmured, half to himself. “We must’ve entered somewhere near there.” He tried to gauge their distance, estimating how far they might have come.

Talon hesitated, his fingers brushing against the medallion, feeling its faint warmth through his shirt. “The medallion… it’s guiding me. Or at least, I think it is.

Talon forced a smile, but his fingers lingered on the medallion. He could feel the pull, faint but steady, like a thread tying him to something unseen. Somewhere in his mind, Dominic’s words echoed—the warnings, the confessions, the way the man had spoken of being called into the shadows.

His gaze drifted to the journal in his pack. He hadn’t shared everything yet, and with each step forward, the weight of what he hadn’t said seemed to grow heavier. Griffin’s jokes, Sari’s calm support… they grounded him, reminded him of why they’d come this far together. But he knew that if he revealed everything, the darkness Dominic hinted at, the things left unsaid, would start to creep into their group like the forest’s shadows.

Talon slowed, his gaze drifting down to the journal tucked securely in his pack.

Talon hesitated, gripping the journal tighter. He’d been wrestling with how much to share, sifting through Dominic’s entries, trying to find a way to explain without casting shadows on himself or the medallion. The thought of Griffin’s skepticism only deepened his reluctance, but he knew he couldn’t avoid it forever.

“Sort of,” Talon replied, his voice low. “He doesn’t explain it exactly, but he wrote about shadows, things he could see but couldn’t understand.” He paused, gauging their reactions. “It’s as if… something was leading him, and he didn’t know if he could trust it.”

Talon nodded, grateful for her support, but his mind lingered on the parts he hadn’t shared—the passages where Dominic spoke of visions, of things that haunted him even in sleep. The hints that whatever power lay within the Veil piece he’d taken from Daniel had consumed him.

But he couldn’t say it. Couldn’t risk the fragile trust that held them together, the thread that bound them to this path. Instead, he tightened his grip on the medallion, forcing himself to focus on the journey, to ignore the growing shadows that crept closer with each step.

The forest grew thicker and darker as they pressed onward, each step feeling heavier, the air laden with an oppressive stillness that only deepened the further they went.

Talon lagged behind slightly, the medallion’s subtle pull drawing him forward, but the weight of Dominic’s journal was a heavier anchor, each word a reminder of the shadows he was carrying alone.

Talon took a slow breath, flipping to a page he’d already read a dozen times, each line haunting him with its weight. “Dominic was… haunted by it. He felt like he was carrying something he couldn’t control.

“Maybe,” Talon admitted. “But I don’t know if it’s the same thing. He never explained what he meant by the Veil, just… that it was more than he could handle.” He looked down, unwilling to meet their eyes, the words he hadn’t spoken pressing against his throat like a secret he couldn’t let out.
