[Atmosphere]
[Discomfort]
[InternalReflection]
I can’t sleep. This floor feels like it’s been chiseled from stone, every shift sending a fresh stab of discomfort into my aching body. The air is damp, cold, and thick with a musty staleness that feels ancient, like it belongs to a place long forgotten by life itself. Everything here is filthy, suffocatingly wrong. This whole thing… it’s so wrong. How did we let it come to this?

[Motivation]
[Conflict]
I didn’t expect to be here—not last week, not ever. When Talon told me about the vision and the medallion, it sounded insane. But he caught me at just the right moment—mid-fantasy of burning my painfully bland, meticulously curated princess life to the ground and twirling through the ashes like a deranged pyromaniac ballerina. I don't know if it was the pain and fear in his eyes, or my own desperate need to escape the suffocating expectations of my family’s predestined prison, but either way, I said yes. I thought it would be a short escape—a few hours hiking through overgrown trails, a little fun, a little adventure.

[Talon]
[Tension]
Talon, my Talon, sits hunched over by the lifeless fireplace, his hands clasped tightly enough to make his knuckles pale. Even in sleep, the weight of everything seems to press on him, etching worry into his posture. The medallion’s burden isn’t just something he carries—it’s inside him, winding tighter with every passing day, pulling all of us into its spiraling madness. I’ve thought about turning back more times than I care to admit, about dragging Griffin and his incessant complaints with me. But something always stops me. Maybe it’s the way Talon looks at the world—that haunted, faraway gaze that seems to hold truths too vast and terrible for the rest of us to comprehend. Or maybe it’s just me, desperate to believe in something—anything—that feels bigger than my suffocatingly small life.

[Griffin]
[Humor]
[Attraction]
And then there’s Griffin. Or as I’ve started calling him in my head, ‘Knightmare.’ He hasn’t stopped grumbling since the moment we set foot in the forest, but of course, he’s still here. For all his maddening theatrics, there’s something steady in him—a raw instinct that feels like he’d throw himself into the fire to keep us safe, even if he complained the whole way. Swinging that ridiculous sword around like we’re in some medieval drama and he’s the star—clumsy, dirty, and absolutely infuriating. Honestly, it’s a miracle he hasn’t chopped his own leg off yet. He’s maddening. He’s ridiculous. And God help me, he’s… sexy, in a way I’d never admit out loud. It’s not like the steady warmth I feel with Talon—the kind that’s been there for years. No, this is sharper, hotter, dangerous, and forbidden. Tangled up with something I can’t quite name.

[Cabin]
[Mystery]
[Journal]
This cabin is disgusting. Sure, I’m glad to be indoors and out of the rain, but calling it shelter feels generous. The floorboards creak under every step, dust coats every surface, and the air reeks of decay. But it’s got a strange, unsettling character, like it’s hiding secrets just out of reach. It feels like part of the tangled mystery we’ve stumbled into.
And then there’s the journal—an unassuming little thing that feels oddly monumental. Half the time it reads like the unhinged ramblings of a lunatic, but I can’t tell if it’s a warning, a clue, or simply chaos given form. There’s a pull to it I can’t quite explain. Maybe it’s the way the words on the pages echo Talon’s haunted look or how they make this whole ordeal feel like a thread I need to unravel. The look in Talon’s eyes as he reads the pages aloud... the way they dart, almost frantic, the way his voice trembles like he’s holding something back. The tears that gather at the edges but refuse to fall. It wasn't by accident we found it. The journal calls to me, whispering secrets I don’t yet understand. It feels like a thread that, if pulled, might unravel everything—or maybe tie it all together. It’s as if it’s waiting for me, destined to be part of this chaos we’re caught in. But the weight of survival presses harder. Food, water, not dying—that has to come first. The madness can wait.

[Freedom]
[Escape]
Everything inside me loves this. The mystery. The danger. It’s like nothing I’ve ever felt before. I’ve spent my whole life doing what I was supposed to do, living up to expectations. But this… this is different. Out here, in the middle of nowhere, with two boys who couldn’t be more opposite, chasing something that might not even exist? It’s freedom. It’s fun. It’s terrifying. I just wish there was an outhouse.

[Introspection]
[Medallion]
[Burden]
Sleep doesn’t come for me anymore. Not really. I lie down, close my eyes, but rest never follows. My body feels like it’s betraying me, stiff and aching from days of this relentless journey. The medallion whispers like a second heartbeat, thrumming in my chest, its pull as constant and unrelenting as gravity. Now this journal. Now this perfect spiral into madness written in a phantasmagoria daze. I can feel the Veil draw on my soul as I pour through its pages. Each word feels alive, tugging at the fragile threads of my sanity. The medallion led us here. I wish I could forget... forget... forget. It wants me to move, to keep going, even now while the others are asleep. Especially now. The darkness outside presses against the cabin walls, its weight mirroring the storm in my chest. Rest feels like a distant, unattainable luxury, one I can’t afford even if I wanted to. The medallion is both my tormentor and my guide—the reason I am awake and the reason I will never truly sleep again.

[Griffin]
[Conflict]
[Frustration]
Griffin is sprawled out near the far wall, his snoring filling the cabin like a low, ceaseless grumble. Even in sleep, he manages to irritate me. I love him, but his endless complaining cuts me leaving wounds that bleed. He’s not wrong—this place is madness wrapped in misery—but his constant negativity gnaws at what little resolve I have left. The guilt pooling in my gut churns, threatening to spill over, and his attitude makes it harder to keep myself from unraveling completely. His sleeping bag is twisted around him, a cocoon of warmth that seems to mock my restlessness. I envy his ability to shut it all out, even for a moment, and resent it in equal measure. His breaths rise and fall steadily, a rhythm that grates against my own chaos, a cruel reminder of how detached he can be from the weight pressing on me.

[Love]
[Anchor]
Sari... She’s tucked into her sleeping bag near the fireless hearth, her silhouette barely visible in the faint light that filters through the cabin’s cracks. Her face is calm, beautifully peaceful, like a fleeting memory of a time untouched by this madness. She’s not just my anchor—she’s everything. My driving force. The one steady point in a world that feels like it’s crumbling around me. She isn’t just my friend; she’s my purpose, the reason I haven’t given in to the pull of the medallion entirely. And yet, I feel guilt, sharp and unrelenting, because I’m dragging her into something she doesn’t deserve.
Reluctant, dark envy creeps in, though I know it’s ridiculous. Her strength, her intellect—it feels almost unfair how effortlessly she embodies those qualities. Her beauty, too, is unmatched, a quiet radiance that draws people to her without her even trying. I know deep down that if we hadn’t met at that summer camp all those years ago, she would’ve never had a reason to be my friend. She’s the one who should be leading us. It’s her. The way she seems untouched by the storm raging both inside and outside only deepens my self-loathing. How can someone so vital, so centered, remain tethered to someone as fractured as me? The medallion didn’t choose her—it chose me—but perhaps it got it wrong. Or maybe the Veil needs someone broken to do its bidding.
But she doesn’t feel the pull. The medallion chose me, for reasons I’ll never understand, and it refuses to let go, even in the moments I wish it would.

[Cabin]
[Oppression]
[Fragility]
The cabin feels like a tomb, the air pressing down on me with a weight that claws at my chest. Every creak of the damp wood whispers a reminder of how fragile this place is, how fragile we are. The storm outside has returned with a vengeance, the wind howling like a beast circling its prey. Branches claw at the windows, and the sound of rain drumming on the roof merges with the groan of the old beams. It’s relentless, like the medallion’s pull. But I can’t focus on it, not really. I can’t let myself. If I let it in—if I let the thought settle in my mind—I’ll shatter. And shattering isn’t an option. Not now. Not ever. The wind seems alive, the draft through the cracks brushing against my face like unseen fingers. Somewhere deep in the storm’s chaos, I can hear whispers—not words, but emotions, desperate and hollow.

[Journal]
[Vision]
[Prophecy]
The journal reposes on the floor by my head. It landed there when I fell asleep—if I even slept. Closed tightly as if to trap its secrets. I’ve read those pages so many times I don’t need to look at them; they’re burned into my memory. But even now, in the silence, the vision crawls back into my mind, as vivid and unrelenting as the medallion’s pull. My stomach tightens, and the air in the cabin feels thinner, harder to pull into my lungs. It’s the reason I’m here, dragging Sari and Griffin into this. The words etched into the yellowed pages echo in my mind like a chant, looping endlessly. Each line feels like a thread pulling me deeper into something I don’t understand, something I might never escape. The edges of the journal are frayed, as though it resists its own existence, as if Dominic himself tried to erase its burden and failed.

[Vision]
[Veil]
[Metis]
I saw it before we left—clearer than any dream, more vivid than anything I’d ever experienced. The medallion seared against my palm, its hum vibrating through my bones, pulling me into a place that felt ancient and alive, as though the world itself had opened a wound. I was standing in a jungle, the air oppressive with heat and thick with the sound of creatures moving unseen. Ahead of me was the temple: colossal, weathered, and alive in a way no building should be. Vines crawled up its stone walls, pulsing like veins feeding a beating heart, and the moss-covered steps seemed to vibrate under my gaze. It wasn’t just old; it was waiting.
Inside, the air shifted. It was colder, sharper, carrying whispers that pressed against my skin. They weren’t words, but emotions: anger, desperation, despair. And something else—a presence at the edges of my mind, vast and formless, watching from the shadows. It wasn’t the Veil, but it was connected, like a puppeteer pulling unseen strings. The hallways twisted unnaturally, narrowing and darkening until it felt like the temple itself was alive, shifting to swallow me whole. The feeling of being watched didn’t fade—it grew stronger, pressing down on me like an unbearable weight. I felt it in my chest, the medallion pulling tighter, as though it had fused to my very bones.

[Veil]
[Blood]
[Horror]
And then I saw it: the Veil. Suspended in a shaft of light that cut through the blackness, it radiated power. It wasn’t just an object; it was alive, aware. Its presence filled the room, demanding submission from everything around it, including me. I felt it watching, studying, like it already knew everything I’d ever been and everything I could be. And then the visions came.
Blood. Sari’s. Griffin’s. Mine. Thick and glistening, pooling across the cold stone floor in sluggish rivers that reflected the unnatural light of the Veil. The light from the Veil reflected in pools of red that grew larger, swallowing the room. My chest felt hollow, as though the life had been ripped from me, leaving behind only the searing pull of the medallion in my hand. The scent of iron filled my nostrils, thick and choking, as if the blood in the vision wasn’t confined to the dream but had seeped into the air around me. The Veil’s power wasn’t just radiating—it was consuming, threading itself into the air and into me.

[Madness]
[Resolve]
I look back at the journal, at the spidery handwriting scrawled across its yellowed pages. The words seem alive, writhing just beneath the surface, daring me to read them again. One line in particular gnaws at me, refusing to let go: *“The path to the temple is the path to madness, but it is also the only path to salvation.”* That was the last line Dominic wrote—or at least, the last line he allowed to survive before tearing out the remaining pages.
I wonder what truths, what horrors, were lost with those pages. Did he rip them out to protect others, or to shield himself? Was he afraid of the weight of the words, or the power they might unleash? The absence is louder than anything else, a void I can’t ignore.
I don’t know what the line truly means, not fully, but I feel it in my bones. This isn’t just a journey—it’s a reckoning. And if I let Sari and Griffin see how deeply I’ve already unraveled, they’ll leave. Or worse, they’ll try to stop me, and I can’t let that happen. I’d rather lose my mind completely than lose them, even if it means dragging them deeper into the madness alongside me.

[Medallion]
[Weight]
[Burden]
The medallion hums against my chest, its pulse uneven now, erratic, as though it senses the memory forcing its way to the surface. I wrap my fingers around it, its unnatural warmth radiating into my palm like it’s alive, reacting to my thoughts. It feels heavier than it should, like it’s absorbing the storm outside, the cabin’s oppressive weight, and my own fractured will.
The green shadows on the wall dance as I open and close my fist, the medallion’s glow casting faint patterns that twist and shift. It’s beautiful, in a way that feels utterly wrong, like it’s mocking me for being so entranced by its pull. I run my thumb along its edge, the hum growing louder, sharper.
It’s no longer a pull. It’s a command.

[Skepticism]
This whole trip? Stupid. Reckless. I can’t believe I let Talon rope me into this mess. No—that’s not fair. He didn’t rope me into anything. I came because I knew he’d need me, and I wasn’t wrong. Talon’s a good guy, but let’s be real—he’s not built for this. Without me, he’d probably trip over a root and impale himself on a pinecone, claiming it was destiny. And this medallion of his? Don’t get me started. Every time he talks about it, I see the cracks forming, like it’s some mystical artifact instead of a glorified trinket. I’ve seen better at flea markets in La Lagunilla, complete with fake ancient curses for half the price. Even if he’s right—even if the medallion is real and everything he says it is—dragging us out here still feels like the worst idea in a long list of bad ones.

[Sword]
[Connection]
[Symbolism]
It's freezing in here. How did Sari get the only blanket? Part of me wants to crawl under it with her, you know body heat and all that but I don't want to give her the wrong impression. The last thing I need is her sweating me while we are in the middle of no where. And what is with her and my sword? OK, so it's not practical. She thinks my sword is ridiculous. Sure, it’s impractical—she’s not wrong—but she doesn’t get it. The sword rests next to me, its weight a quiet reassurance I can’t quite put into words. It’s old, sure—a relic from another time—and completely impractical, but it feels right. It’s not just a weapon; it’s a connection, a thread tying me to something bigger than this mess we’re tangled in. When I hold it, I feel grounded, like it’s the only thing in my life that makes any sense right now. Maybe carrying a sword through these woods is laughable. I get that. But I don’t care. It’s mine. A reminder that even in chaos, some things endure. And I’ll be damned if I let go of it.

[Conflict]
And then there’s Sari. Sari, Sari. She’s always been the smartest person in the room, the one who can see the angles no one else notices. She’s calm under pressure, sharp as a blade, and beautiful in a way that stops me in my tracks if I think about it too long. But she’s also impossible. Always taking Talon’s side, no matter how ridiculous he sounds. If he said the medallion told him to jump off a cliff, she’d probably hand him a parachute and tell me to carry his bags. Meanwhile, she’s harder on me—like I’m the one dragging us into danger. Maybe I am, but it’d be nice to win one argument for once. But it’s more than that. It’s the way she cares, the way she makes you feel like you matter, even when she’s annoyed with you. I’d follow her anywhere, but she’s following Talon, and that… that I don’t get. He’s my friend, my brother, but he’s weak. Still, I’ll give him this—he keeps moving forward, even when it’s clear he’s about to break. That’s more than a lot of people could manage. He’s cracking under the weight of whatever this medallion is doing to him. And Sari? She deserves better than to be dragged into this.

[Brotherhood]
[Burden]
Talon doesn’t see himself the way I do. He thinks he’s failing us, and maybe he is, but I can’t let him fall apart. Not here. Not now. He’s got this look in his eyes lately, like he’s drowning, but he’s too proud to ask for help. I’d carry him if I had to, just to keep him moving forward. That’s what you do for family. And Talon? He’s family. Weak, stubborn, and a complete mess—but he’s still here, still trying, and that’s enough for me. Family isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being there, even when you’re cracked and falling apart.

[Doubt]
[Danger]
[Resolve]
Every sound outside the cabin sets my teeth on edge. This place feels wrong, like it’s watching us, waiting for the right moment to swallow us whole. I don’t trust this forest. I don’t trust this medallion. And I don’t trust whatever’s waiting for us at the end of this insane journey. But I trust them. Sari. Talon. As much as I hate this, as much as I want to turn back and drag them both with me, I can’t. Not until I know they’ll be okay. Not until I know they’ll make it out of this alive.
