Talon’s vision pulled him into a realm both hauntingly familiar and utterly alien. Silhouettes stretched across a landscape of jagged ruins, their forms distorted and sharp against the murky, oppressive sky. Symbols—ancient, indecipherable—glowed faintly across walls that seemed more like bones than stone, like markers from a civilization lost to time, or something far more disturbing. The symbols flickered, each pulse casting an eerie light that felt alive, pulsating with its own unsettling rhythm.
