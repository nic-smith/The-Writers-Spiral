**Purpose**: Escalate both the tension within the group and Talon’s internal struggle with the medallion’s power. Set the stage for Griffin’s growing distrust and reveal Talon’s fear of his potential role in the prophecy.

**Writing Style**: Darkly Gothic and tense, with rich, foreboding descriptions of the forest and a sense of cosmic inevitability woven into Talon’s connection to the Veil.

**Key Events**:

1. **Distorted Environment and Ominous Symbols**:
   - The group treks through a forest distorted by the Veil’s influence—*trees appear unnaturally twisted, faint symbols flicker in the shadows, and a low mechanical hum fills the air*.

2. **Griffin’s Distrust and Skepticism**:
   - Griffin confronts Talon, expressing his belief that the medallion is a corrupting force. He warns Talon that unchecked power only brings ruin. This clash between Griffin’s skepticism and Talon’s curiosity ignites tension, revealing Griffin’s protective yet suspicious nature.

   - Talon briefly hesitates as he feels the medallion’s pull intensify, overwhelmed by a flash vision of himself as a destructive force. This moment of hesitation unsettles him, exposing a vulnerability to the medallion’s influence and deepening his fear of the prophecy. Griffin catches the flicker of fear on Talon’s face, amplifying his own distrust.

4. **Sari’s Leadership and Silent Doubt**:
   - Sari steps in to quell the rising tension, guiding the group forward with calm resolve. Her internal monologue, however, reveals her own doubts about the medallion’s impact on Talon, underscoring her role as the group’s reluctant but steady leader.

   - **Talon**: Feels the unsettling pull of the medallion, plagued by fear that he might embody the very prophecy he dreads.
   - **Griffin**: Growing mistrustful, caught between loyalty to Talon and fear of the medallion’s corrupting influence.
   - **Sari**: Calm on the surface but harboring doubts, concerned about the group’s unity and the medallion’s impact on Talon.

**Writing Style Notes**:

**Writing Style**: Heavy and foreboding, with layered Gothic symbolism and an ominous atmosphere that foreshadows the group’s inner discord.

   - Overwhelmed by his distrust, Griffin tries to seize the medallion from Talon. Startled and fearful, Talon instinctively taps into its power to defend himself, unleashing a brief surge of dark energy. This frightens them both and leaves Talon feeling guilty, shaken by his fear that he’s slipping toward a destiny of destruction.

4. **Eowyn’s Chilling Neutrality**:
   - Observing the incident, Eowyn responds with a detached remark—“Emotion clouds judgment”—which strikes Sari as disturbingly logical. Her lack of empathy hints at a deeper, alien alignment, foreshadowing her role as an unsettling presence in the group.
