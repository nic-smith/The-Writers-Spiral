### **Chapter 18: Seeds of Betrayal**

- **Purpose**: Set up Eowyn’s hidden agenda, deepen Talon’s dependency on the medallion, and escalate external threats with a stronger influence from Metis and the Veil.

- **Key Events**:
   - **Eowyn’s Subtle Changes**: Eowyn’s guidance shifts toward emotionless logic, suggesting paths that align with her hidden agenda. Sari notices minor inconsistencies in her past advice and brief lapses in empathy, hinting at a hidden side.
   - **Revenant Ambush**: The group encounters the Revenant, now equipped with advanced tactics. Talon relies on the medallion, but the Veil’s force pushes harder, creating blurred lines between vision and reality. He sees scenes of crumbling alien structures and darkened skies, symbols reminiscent of Revelation.
   - **Talon’s Inner Struggle**: Talon’s power struggle with the medallion intensifies. He catches glimpses of himself wielding apocalyptic force, which shakes his sense of self and control, subtly eroding his confidence.

- **Emotional State**:
   - **Talon**: Torn between a need for control and fear of losing himself to the medallion’s influence.
   - **Sari**: Anxious, suspicious of Eowyn’s motives but unsure of Talon’s mental state.
   - **Eowyn**: Detached, calculated, testing the group’s reactions and quietly manipulating Talon.

- **Writing Style Notes**: Vision scenes should be fragmented, with jarring shifts that disorient Talon. Prose should emphasize the thin veil between reality and vision, making Talon’s disorientation palpable.

   - **Conflicting Loyalties**: Talon’s sense of paranoia heightens as he feels both Sari and Eowyn are hiding intentions. Sari, meanwhile, senses Eowyn’s manipulation but questions her own suspicions amid Talon’s instability.

- **Emotional State**:
   - **Talon**: Deeply paranoid, feeling reality slip and seeing himself as a pawn in a cosmic game.
   - **Sari**: Suspicious, increasingly certain that Eowyn is manipulating them, but conflicted by Talon’s worsening mental state.
   - **Eowyn**: Emotionally distant, calmly guiding the group toward an inevitable breaking point.
