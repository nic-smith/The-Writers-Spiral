### **Background**

Sari grew up in a family that demanded excellence, both intellectually and emotionally. Her father, an engineer with an analytical mind, encouraged her to question everything, while her mother, a social worker, instilled a deep empathy for others. These influences made Sari a natural problem-solver, able to assess situations logically without losing sight of the human element.

However, her upbringing wasn’t without challenges. As the eldest sibling, she often found herself mediating family disputes, a role she grew into out of necessity. These early experiences honed her ability to navigate conflict but also left her with a need to control her environment—sometimes at the expense of her own vulnerability.

A defining moment in her past was a failure to prevent a major fallout between close friends, Ava and Nolan, during her university years. Despite her best efforts to mediate their growing divide, the situation escalated, leaving a lasting impact on Sari’s confidence in resolving deeply personal conflicts. During this time, Talon and Griffin were not actively present in her daily life, which forced Sari to rely entirely on herself for emotional support and decision-making. While this fostered her independence, it also reinforced her tendency to internalize stress.

Sari pursued a degree in psychology with a specialization in conflict resolution and group dynamics. Her academic focus reflected her natural strengths as a mediator and strategist, providing her with tools she would later apply in her interpersonal relationships. After graduating with honors at 22, Sari spent four years honing her skills in high-pressure environments, developing her ability to navigate crises with both logic and empathy. While this fostered her independence,

   - **Traits**: Sari excels at analyzing situations from multiple angles and planning for contingencies. She’s a natural strategist who thrives on solving complex problems.
   - **Behavior**: Her calm, methodical approach is a source of stability in the group. However, her tendency to plan everything sometimes clashes with Talon’s impulsiveness and Griffin’s frustration at their lack of progress. She is humble choosing the good of her friends to self elevation.

2. **Sarcasm and Dark Humor**

   - **Traits**: Humor is Sari’s go-to defense mechanism, a way to mask stress and lighten the mood. Her dark humor developed as a coping mechanism during her teenage years, stemming from the high expectations and family tensions she often faced. While it helps her navigate difficult moments, it can sometimes catch others off guard or alienate those who misinterpret her tone. During arguments or tense moments, she’s quick with a biting quip that can either de-escalate or exacerbate the situation, depending on her audience.

3. **Empathy and Emotional Depth**

   - **Traits**: Sari’s ability to read people and intuitively sense their emotions makes her an excellent mediator. Her emotional intelligence balances her analytical side, allowing her to guide others through crises.

   - **Behavior**: She often uses humor and sincerity to connect with her friends, though her reluctance to share her own vulnerabilities can create a sense of distance.
