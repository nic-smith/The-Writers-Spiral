Chapter 1: Into the Unknown

[P1] They pushed deeper into the forest, trees looming over them, closing in like a thick, silent barrier. Twisted branches formed a canopy that blocked out the dying light, their gnarled fingers clawing at Talon’s arms and catching on his sleeves, scraping his skin. The air grew heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves, pressing down on them like a noose /*Note: Nooses don't press down, they pull up*/. Shadows danced at the corners of his vision, whispering secrets he couldn’t quite grasp, while the dim areas between the trees seemed to grow more obscure with each step, creating the sense that the forest itself was tightening its grip, ensnaring them deeper within its grasp.

[P2] Talon could hear Griffin’s frustrated breaths behind him, every exhale sharp with irritation. If Sari and Talon couldn't hear the darkness in his tone, they could feel it through every slash of his sword against the underbrush that stood definately in his path. 

[New Paragraph]Sari remained silent, her expression set and focused, flicking her gaze between the undergrowth and Talon’s back. /*Rewrite this next sentence to have one blade stored at her side and the other in her right hand*/ She held her blades tightly, using them to cut through patches of thick grass and tangled vines that blocked their path. 

[New Paragraph]“We’ve been wandering for hours," Griffin irked. We've been wondering for days!,” Griffin barked with even more conviction. His voice edged with frustration. “Your medallion isn’t leading us anywhere but around in circles!” Griffin said. His eyes darted nervously between the trees, doubt creeping into his tone as the oppressive forest seemed to close in around them. This, their 2nd day of trudging through the underbrush, had fraid their nerves and brought their anxiety to a boiling point. It was sticky with heat and humidity making their breaths labored as they tried to suck in the thick air around them.  

[P3] Talon clenched the medallion in his pocket, feeling its cool surface against his palm. He opened his mouth to try to explain what he really didn't understand himself but his breath hitched at the first word making only a small shuddered sound.

[New Paragraph] "What!?!" Griffin spat in frustration of Talon's timidness.

[New Paragraph] “It’s supposed to guide us,” Talon replied with no conviction in his tone as uncertainty gnawed at his resolve. The force that propelling him forward was not something that he could explain. The power that he felt in the medallion was holy new to him. The memories of his father’s stories about the heirloom echoed in his mind—the tales of its power, of how it could reveal hidden truths but until recent they were just stories. He had sparcly worn it until his dad's funeral but the night of the day he told his dad goodbye the medallion came to life in his mind and in his soul. Now, it felt more like a burden than a blessing. A call he can't ignore.

[P4] “Maybe we should take a break and regroup,” Sari suggested, glancing at her dwindling water supply. “We need to find water soon or we will have bigger problems. I only packed enough for two days, but we’ve been lost for nearly four. If we don’t find something soon…” Her voice trailed off, the unspoken worry heavy in the air.

[P4.5] Talon didn’t turn around. His grip tightened on the medallion hanging from his neck, his fingers tracing the familiar grooves as if seeking reassurance. The pull at his soul was strong, a steady pulse that felt like it was guiding him through the darkness. But he knew how it must look to Griffin—stumbling blindly through the forest, chasing shadows.

[P5] “It’s this way,” he said quietly, the certainty in his voice betraying the uncertainty he felt inside. He didn't mean to ignore Sari's suggestion but he couldn't bear to sit and watch Griffin stew. 

[New Paragraph]The vision he had the night of the funeral was still fresh in his mind, its images flickering in his thoughts like shards of a broken dream. He couldn’t explain why he felt drawn to this place, only that he did. And he knew, deep down, that turning back was not an option.

[P6] Griffin muttered something under his breath, his frustration barely contained. “We’re low on food, low on sleep, and you’re leading us who knows where, following… that thing.” His gaze flicked to the medallion, his expression hard.

[P7] Sari glanced back at Griffin, her voice calm but firm. “We agreed to follow Talon’s lead, Griffin. Whatever he’s feeling, there’s a reason we’re here.” She moved past a thick patch of brambles, carefully lifting a branch out of her way. “Maybe… maybe there’s something we’re supposed to find.”

[P8] Griffin’s expression didn’t soften, but he held his tongue, casting a wary look at the forest around them. “Fine,” he muttered, though his voice was heavy with doubt. “But this place… it feels wrong. Like we’re not supposed to be here.”

[P9] The silence that followed his words was thick, pressing down on them like a weight. Talon felt the tension settle into his shoulders, the pressure of Griffin’s mistrust gnawing at his resolve and pulling weakly at his knees. He didn’t know how to explain it to Griffin, didn’t know how to make him understand that this was more than just a feeling. It was a pull, a call, something he couldn’t ignore even if he wanted to.

[P10] They walked in silence, each of them lost in their own thoughts, the forest closing in tighter with every step. The light filtering through the canopy was thin and pale, casting long, twisted shadows that stretched across the forest floor like skeletal fingers. Talon’s steps slowed as the path grew more treacherous, the ground uneven and littered with roots that seemed to reach up from the earth to trip them.

[P11] Sari was the first to stumble, her foot catching on a hidden root. Her neck and shoulder smacked hard against the bark of a tree, bounded off of before catching herself. A small scream escaping from her lungs as she hit the ground off the rebound. Without betraying the pain, she dug her blade into the ground to steady herself, her hand gripping the hilt tightly. “Watch your step,” she warned but it was too late. She glancing back at Griffin, who muttered a curse as he tripped on the same root and narrowly avoided a collision with her. She limped forward into a walk again then reach up to wipe the blood off the cut on her neck.

[P12] Talon glanced back, catching the brief flicker of frustration on Griffin’s face that was compounded by the near collosion with Sari. His face betraying him before he quickly masked it with a scowl. They were all tired, worn down by days of travel, their supplies dwindling and their patience running thin. The medallion’s pull was the only thing driving Talon forward, and even he was beginning to feel the weight of doubt pressing down on him.

[P13] Griffin’s voice broke the silence again, his tone low and edged with frustration. “You still haven’t told us exactly what you saw in that vision, Talon. All we know is that you felt something… calling you here. But what are we supposed to find?”

[P14] Talon hesitated, his fingers tightening around the medallion. The vision, although fragmented, was surreal and incredibly vivid. He was home in his bedroom still reeling from his father's death when the vision pulled him in. It felt like it lasted a life time and the world around him was completely lost. There were things that were familiar and things that were ancient. There were clips of structures that were other worldly and things that were ancient but known. There were flashes of people around a green glow and hallow eyes against a purple sky. He shuttered as he remembered vividly remembered the voice—a voice that felt both familiar and distant, calling his name. Nothing made sense until the moment before he came too; it was his dad, the man he just buried, holding a glowing green medillion, his medillion, out to him like a gesture to pass a generations responsibility to him. Then in a moment this father's face morphed into a man in a giant headdress. His nose was pierced with a straight bar through it. Earings like medillions hanging from his hears. War paint on his face and tattoos of tribal markings on his face, neck and arms. He looked battle worn with scars and fresh cuts on his face and body but his face was weathered with earned wisdom.

[New Paragraph]He came to lying half off his bed, one leg over the foot of the bed and half his body assque over the side. The vision brought panic like he had never experienced. He rolled over falling to the floor and retched. He recalled the frantic call to Sari moments after the vision. He lunged up from the ground still choking from the vomit and ran for his phone. Her voice on the other end was his lifeline. He panicked and balled, this voice coming in gasps. Her voice on the other end was a his lifeline. "Talon, I'm here and you are safe. Listen to my voice and breath deep. Are you OK?" she asked as his gasping turned to choking. 

[P15] “I don’t know,” he choked. His voice barely more than a whisper. He held his breath in vain to calm his nerves. He stammered through parts of the vision and speed through others. Lost to what he was saying, Sari reached into his soul with practiced poise said what he needed to hear "Talon listen to my voice." she stated again and focus on breathing deep. Moments passed and his gasps turned to slow breaths. "Something happened..." Talon exclaimed. "Talon, stay on the phone with me. I am on my way".

[New Paragraph] She drove the 5 minutes to his house and they sent all night into early morning pooring over the vision. Then she lay next to him stroking his hair until he finally fell asleep.

...

[New Paragraph] Talon, shook his head to get the dazed cobwebs out of his head, the memory of that night just a few weeks back fading into the real world. It has been some time since Griffin had asked about the vision, assuming that Talon was ignoring him. By the time Talon answered simply "The vision was... hard to explain. It just gives me a... a feeling I guess."

[P16] Griffin paused trying to remember the question he asked then scoffed, his gaze hardening. “That’s it? A feeling? We’re out here, risking our lives, low on food, following a feeling?”

[P17] Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s shoulder, her touch grounding him. “It’s more than just a feeling, Griffin,” she said softly, though there was a hint of uncertainty in her own voice. “Talon wouldn’t have led us here if he didn’t believe there was a reason.”

[P17.1] Talon felt the weight of Griffin’s words settle over him, a chain tightening around his mind. Evedyday removed from the vision brought his resolve down and each step through these woods made the doubt grow heavier. Doubt that wrapped tighter around his chest, restricting his breaths. He wanted to believe in the medallion’s pull, but fear gnawed at the edges of his resolve.

[P17.2] Sari felt it too—his fear, like a tremor reaching across an invisible thread that bound them. She stepped closer, her voice quiet but unshakable. “Talon,” she murmured, “fear is a chain; courage breaks it.” She met his gaze, her expression steady. “Trust what you feel. We’re here because you believe in this path—and I believe in you.”

[P18] Griffin shook his head, looking away. “Belief doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. Food does. Shelter does. And right now, we don’t have much of either.”

[P19] The weight of his words settled over them, a cold reminder of their dwindling resources and the uncertainty that lay ahead. But Talon couldn’t shake the pull of the medallion, the feeling that they were on the brink of something vast and concealed, just beyond the edge of perception.

[P20] As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, the forest grew darker, the shadows lengthening and merging into a solid wall of black. The air felt heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves, and Talon found it harder to breathe, as if the forest itself was pressing down on them, tightening around them like a noose /*Note: We used this line. We can use it again but we need to refer to the first used and make the second use unique and more deadly*/.

[New Paragraph] "We need to make camp while we still have light." Griffin said bluntly but Talon could see something in the distance. A shape that did not fit the patter of the forest. He started to speed up toward the shape in the distance leaving Griffin and Sari to have to run to catch up. 

[New Paragraph] Just as they got to him he broke into a run. Sari, jogging behind him finally saw what he saw and broke into a joyful giggle. Finally, Griffin exclamed "It that...?" just as Talon broke to a total halt.

[P21] The oppressive doubt he felt inside melted away replaced by a giddy furver. There half-hidden by twisted branches and thick undergrowth stood a run down old cabin, alone and decaying, its walls warped and broken in places, its roof sagging under the weight of time.

[P22] Sari let out a breath, her voice filled with a mixture of relief and caution. “Is that…?”

[P23] Talon nodded, his heart pounding as he took a step closer. “Looks like shelter.”

[P24] Griffin’s expression was unreadable as he moved forward, scanning the area around the cabin with a wary gaze. “Or a trap,” he muttered, his voice barely more than a whisper.

[P25] But even as he spoke, Talon felt a strange sense of familiarity, as though the cabin had been waiting for them all along, hidden deep within the forest’s dark embrace.

[P26] As they reached the cabin’s entrance, a chill ran down Talon’s spine. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were crossing a threshold, stepping into a place that was both sanctuary and prison.

[P27] Pushing open the door, Talon stepped inside, the musty air wrapping around them like a thick blanket. Dust motes danced in the slanting light that filtered through the cracked windows. It was as if they were entering a forgotten world, one that held the secrets of the past and the promise of the unknown.
