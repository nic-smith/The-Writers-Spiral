Prologue

[P1] Talon’s vision pulled him into a realm both hauntingly familiar and utterly alien. Shadows stretched across a landscape of jagged ruins, their forms distorted and sharp against the dark, oppressive sky. Symbols—ancient, indecipherable—glowed faintly across walls that seemed more like bones than stone, like markers from a civilization lost to time, or something far more disturbing. The symbols flickered, each pulse casting an eerie light that felt alive, pulsing with its own unsettling rhythm.

[P2] He felt drawn to them. Or, rather, something inside him was drawn, pulled deeper toward the center of this shadowed world. His heart beat in sync with the flickering symbols, and his hands tingled as if reaching for something unseen. Talon didn’t want to move forward, but the medallion around his neck pulsed insistently, each throb pulling him deeper. It was like an invisible tether, wrapping around his heart, his mind—binding him to whatever this place was.

[P3] There, in the heart of the ruins, a figure waited—a hulking shadow with eyes as hollow as death itself. It didn’t move. It didn’t need to. Its mere presence radiated a dark, cold energy that seeped into Talon’s bones. This figure wasn’t human; it was something vast, something that knew him without ever having met him, and the depth of its knowing sent a chill through his very soul.

[P4] He tried to turn, to force himself back, but his feet stayed anchored to the spot. The pull was stronger now, almost like a command. The figure’s eyes, empty and depthless, seemed to focus on him alone, and in those eyes, he felt the weight of his own insignificance against whatever power this was. He was nothing—a flicker of light in an endless darkness.

[P5] As he stared, a pressure built in his head, something clawing its way into his mind, whispering fragments of thoughts and memories that weren’t his own. For a split second, images flashed: a crumbling city, a sea of endless shadows, and the faint echo of a voice he couldn’t understand. Every fiber of his being told him to run, but there was no escape. The medallion was an anchor, chaining him to this place, to this figure. And as the figure seemed to draw closer without moving, Talon’s heart hammered with a dread he couldn’t name.

[P6] Suddenly, he felt himself pulled back, tumbling through darkness, and everything vanished.

[P7] Talon gasped awake, lungs clawing for air, as if he’d been suffocating under an invisible weight. His hands shook as he instinctively reached for the medallion hanging around his neck. It was cold, almost burning against his chest, and each pulse of it felt like an echo of the vision he’d just escaped. But even here, in the quiet of reality, the vision lingered like a shadow cast on his mind.

[P8] He sat up slowly, pressing his palms into the rough earth beneath him, trying to ground himself. The forest around them was quiet, almost unnaturally so, the kind of silence that felt like a held breath. The air was thick with dampness, and a faint mist clung to the underbrush, coiling around tree trunks like ghostly tendrils.

[P9] Sari shifted nearby, her eyes opening with a soft murmur as she noticed his movement. She didn’t say anything, but her gaze held a quiet understanding, a familiar empathy that made his heart tighten. She didn’t press for answers or explanations. Instead, she simply watched him with that calm, steady gaze, her presence as grounding as the earth beneath him.

[P10] Across the small clearing, Griffin was on watch, leaning against a tree with one hand resting on his weapon. His gaze flicked briefly toward Talon, dark and unreadable. There was something there, a slight narrowing of his eyes as he took in Talon’s distress. It was protectiveness, perhaps, but Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something else beneath it—a tension, a hesitation, as if Griffin were weighing something unspoken.

[P11] The silence stretched between them, thick and tense, and Talon felt the weight of his vision pressing on him, a burden he couldn’t share yet didn’t want to carry alone. He looked down at the medallion, its faint pulsing slowing to a steady beat, almost as if it had a heartbeat of its own.

[P12] He could still feel the pull, the whisper of that dark place beckoning to him, and it took everything he had to resist it.

[P13] Talon forced himself to his feet, the weight of the vision lingering like a shadow that wouldn’t leave him. The forest around them was just beginning to stir with the first hints of dawn, though the light struggled to penetrate the dense canopy. He turned his back to the sleeping camp, hoping the act of walking might shake off the grip of what he’d seen.

[P14] But the medallion’s pulse persisted, slow and steady against his chest, a constant reminder of the place he had glimpsed and the figure that had awaited him. It was as if the medallion was both a shield and a tether, keeping him grounded here yet hinting at something vast and terrible beyond. 

[P15] “Talon.” Sari’s voice was a quiet murmur behind him. She had risen without sound, standing just a few paces away, her face softened by the dim light filtering through the trees. Her gaze was steady, offering understanding without prying. 

[P16] He managed a faint nod, the memory of the vision still pressing in on him, filling his mind with fragments of ruin and hollow eyes. “It was… something dark,” he said finally, the words slipping out before he could hold them back. “Something vast… waiting. It felt like it knew me.”

[P17] Sari’s expression didn’t change, but he could see the concern in the slight furrow of her brow. “Maybe it’s a warning,” she offered. “Or… maybe it’s the medallion trying to tell you something, in its own way.”

[P18] Griffin’s voice cut in from the side, rougher than usual. “Or maybe it’s just a trick, something to mess with your head.” He didn’t look at Talon as he spoke, his gaze still scanning the perimeter, watchful and alert. “That medallion isn’t a gift, Talon. We don’t know what it is, or what it wants.”

[P19] Talon bristled slightly but kept his reply measured. “I know the risks. I’m not… careless.” The words felt hollow, even to him, as if he were trying to convince himself as much as Griffin.

[P20] Griffin’s gaze flicked briefly toward him, a flash of something unreadable in his eyes. “Just keep in mind that not everything that pulls you is worth following.”

[P21] The tension simmered in the quiet that followed, lingering even as Griffin returned to his watch. Talon knew Griffin meant well, that his protectiveness had kept them alive through countless trials. But tonight, it felt different. The distrust, though subtle, was there, woven between words and glances.

[P22] Sari, ever perceptive, broke the silence. “We’ll figure this out,” she said softly, her tone like a balm, a quiet reassurance that cut through the tension. Her gaze shifted from Talon to Griffin, as if anchoring them both, grounding them in the present.

[P23] The sky lightened further, casting long shadows over the camp. But Talon’s mind lingered on the darkness he’d seen, the hollow eyes that seemed to reach across worlds. He could only hope the figure remained in that place, that whatever lay waiting within the vision’s depths would not follow him here.

[P24] As he clutched the medallion, feeling its weight, he knew that hope was fragile at best.
