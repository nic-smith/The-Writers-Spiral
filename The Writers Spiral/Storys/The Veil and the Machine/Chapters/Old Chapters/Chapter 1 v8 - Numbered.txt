Chapter 1: Into the Unknown

[P1] The forest loomed over them, dense and unyielding, each step forward like pushing against a thick, silent wall. Branches clawed at Talon’s arms as he led the way, their twisted fingers catching on his sleeves and scraping his skin. The shadows between the trees seemed to grow deeper with each step, creating the sense that the forest itself was closing in around them.

[P2] He could hear Griffin’s frustrated breaths behind him, every exhale sharp with irritation. Sari was silent, her face set and focused, her gaze flicking constantly between the undergrowth and Talon’s back. She held her blades in her hands, using them to cut through patches of thick grass and tangled vines that blocked their path.

[P3] “Are you sure we’re not just wandering in circles?” Griffin’s voice broke the silence, rough and edged with skepticism. He swatted a low-hanging branch out of his way, glaring at Talon. “Feels like we’re going nowhere.”

[P4] Talon didn’t turn around. His grip tightened on the medallion hanging from his neck, his fingers tracing the familiar grooves as if seeking reassurance. The pull of it was strong, a steady pulse that felt like it was guiding him through the darkness. But he knew how it must look to Griffin—stumbling blindly through the forest, chasing shadows.

[P5] “It’s this way,” he said quietly, the certainty in his voice betraying the uncertainty he felt inside. The vision was still fresh in his mind, its images flickering in his thoughts like shards of a broken dream. He couldn’t explain why he felt drawn to this place, only that he did. And he knew, deep down, that turning back was not an option.

[P6] Griffin muttered something under his breath, his frustration barely contained. “We’re low on food, low on sleep, and you’re leading us who knows where, following… that thing.” His gaze flicked to the medallion, his expression hard.

[P7] Sari glanced back at Griffin, her voice calm but firm. “We agreed to follow Talon’s lead, Griffin. Whatever he’s feeling, there’s a reason we’re here.” She moved past a thick patch of brambles, carefully lifting a branch out of her way. “Maybe… maybe there’s something we’re supposed to find.”

[P8] Griffin’s expression didn’t soften, but he held his tongue, casting a wary look at the forest around them. “Fine,” he muttered, though his voice was heavy with doubt. “But this place… it feels wrong. Like we’re not supposed to be here.”

[P9] The silence that followed his words was thick, pressing down on them like a weight. Talon felt the tension settle into his shoulders, the pressure of Griffin’s mistrust like a shadow at his back. He didn’t know how to explain it to Griffin, didn’t know how to make him understand that this was more than just a feeling. It was a pull, a call, something he couldn’t ignore even if he wanted to.

[P10] They walked in silence, each of them lost in their own thoughts, the forest closing in tighter with every step. The light filtering through the canopy was thin and pale, casting long, twisted shadows that stretched across the forest floor like skeletal fingers. Talon’s steps slowed as the path grew more treacherous, the ground uneven and littered with roots that seemed to reach up from the earth to trip them.

[P11] Sari was the first to stumble, her foot catching on a hidden root. She caught herself just before she fell, her hand gripping the hilt of her blade as she steadied herself. “Watch your step,” she warned, glancing back at Griffin, who muttered a curse as he nearly tripped on the same root.

[P12] Talon glanced back, catching the brief flicker of frustration on Griffin’s face before he masked it with a scowl. They were all tired, worn down by days of travel, their supplies dwindling and their patience running thin. The medallion’s pull was the only thing driving Talon forward, and even he was beginning to feel the weight of doubt pressing down on him.

[P13] Griffin’s voice broke the silence again, his tone low and edged with frustration. “You still haven’t told us exactly what you saw in that vision, Talon. All we know is that you felt something… calling you here. But what are we supposed to find?”

[P14] Talon hesitated, his fingers tightening around the medallion. The vision had been fragmented, like pieces of a puzzle that didn’t quite fit together. He remembered shadows, ruins half-hidden in mist, and a voice—a voice that felt both familiar and distant, calling his name. But he didn’t know what it meant, didn’t know why it felt so urgent.

[P15] “I don’t know,” he admitted quietly, his voice barely more than a whisper. “I just… felt like we needed to come here. Like something was waiting for us.”

[P16] Griffin scoffed, his gaze hardening. “That’s it? A feeling? We’re out here, risking our lives, low on food, following a feeling?”

[P17] Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s shoulder, her touch grounding him. “It’s more than just a feeling, Griffin,” she said softly, though there was a hint of uncertainty in her own voice. “Talon wouldn’t have led us here if he didn’t believe there was a reason.”

[P18] Griffin shook his head, looking away. “Belief doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. Food does. Shelter does. And right now, we don’t have much of either.”

[P19] The weight of his words settled over them, a cold reminder of their dwindling resources and the uncertainty that lay ahead. But Talon couldn’t shake the pull of the medallion, the feeling that they were on the brink of something vast and hidden, just beyond the edge of sight.

[P20] As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, the forest grew darker, the shadows lengthening and merging into a solid wall of black. The air felt heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves, and Talon found it harder to breathe, as if the forest itself was pressing down on them, tightening around them like a noose.

[P21] And then, just as he was beginning to wonder if they would be wandering forever, he saw it—a dark shape looming in the distance, half-hidden by the twisted branches and thick undergrowth. A cabin stood there, alone and decaying, its walls warped and broken in places, its roof sagging under the weight of time.

[P22] Sari let out a breath, her voice filled with a mixture of relief and caution. “Is that…?”

[P23] Talon nodded, his heart pounding as he took a step closer. “Looks like shelter.”

[P24] Griffin’s expression was unreadable as he moved forward, his gaze scanning the area around the cabin with a wary look. “Or a trap,” he muttered, his voice barely more than a whisper.

[P25] But even as he spoke, Talon felt a strange sense of familiarity, as though the cabin had been waiting for them all along, hidden deep within the forest’s dark embrace. He didn’t know what they would find inside, didn’t know if it held answers or more questions, but he felt an undeniable pull, a sense of inevitability that left him with no choice but to press forward.

[P26] As they reached the cabin’s entrance, a chill ran down Talon’s spine, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were crossing a threshold, stepping into a place that was both sanctuary and prison.

[P27] And as he pushed open the door, the shadows inside seemed to shift, welcoming them with a dark, silent promise.

[P28] The air inside the cabin was thick, stale with the scent of damp wood and decay. Dust floated through the beams of weak light that seeped in through cracks in the walls, illuminating patches of the room in thin, uneven streaks. Talon took a cautious step forward, his gaze sweeping across the sparse, forgotten remains of whoever had once lived here.

[P29] A broken lantern lay on a table, its glass cracked and splintered. The floor was littered with debris—bits of rotting fabric, dried leaves, and splinters of wood that crunched underfoot. Talon felt a shiver crawl up his spine as he stepped deeper into the room, the silence pressing down on him, heavy and unyielding.

[P30] Griffin entered next, his eyes scanning every corner, every shadow, his grip tight on his knife. “Great,” he muttered, his voice low. “We’ve traded the open forest for a place that’s barely holding itself together.”

[P31] Sari moved past him, her expression thoughtful as she ran her fingers over the cracked surface of an old table. “It’s still shelter. At least we won’t be out in the rain… if it rains.” She looked over at Talon, a glint of quiet curiosity in her eyes. “What do you think?”

[P32] Talon didn’t answer immediately. There was something strange about this place, something he couldn’t put into words. It felt… familiar, in a way that was unsettling, as if he’d seen it before, maybe in his vision or in a memory he couldn’t quite reach.

[P33] “It’s better than nothing,” he said finally, though his voice lacked conviction. “At least we can rest.”

[P34] Griffin snorted, but he said nothing, moving further into the room as he inspected their surroundings. He kicked at a pile of crumbling leaves in the corner, his face wrinkling in distaste as a cloud of dust rose into the air.

[P35] They moved through the cabin, each of them exploring different corners, their footsteps quiet on the creaking floorboards. Sari opened a cupboard by the wall, finding only rusted cans and empty jars coated in dust. Griffin tested one of the chairs, finding it barely able to support his weight before he stepped back, his face a mask of resignation.

[P36] “Place has been abandoned for a while,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. “Whoever was here left in a hurry… or didn’t have a chance to pack up.”

[P37] Talon felt a strange chill at Griffin’s words. He didn’t know why, but something about the cabin felt… wrong. It was more than just the decay, more than the dust and the disarray. It was as if the place held memories, shadows of lives once lived, lingering in the silence like ghosts.

[P38] As he moved deeper into the room, something caught his eye—a small, half-buried shape under a pile of torn cloth in the corner. He knelt down, brushing aside the fabric, his fingers closing around the cool leather of a worn book.

[P39] He lifted it carefully, feeling the weight of it in his hands. The cover was cracked and faded, the initials “D.H.” barely legible, etched in dark ink that had begun to blur with time. A shiver ran through him as he traced the letters, a sense of recognition settling over him like a shadow.

[P40] “What is that?” Sari’s voice was soft, almost hesitant, as she came to stand beside him.

[P41] Talon looked up, meeting her gaze. “A journal, I think. Belonged to whoever was here last.”

[P42] Griffin’s eyes narrowed as he stepped closer, his expression unreadable. “You think it has anything useful? Or is it just more… memories?”

[P43] Talon hesitated, his fingers brushing over the edges of the worn pages. “There’s only one way to find out.”

[P44] He opened the journal carefully, the pages brittle and yellowed, the ink faded but still legible. The handwriting was cramped and hurried, scrawled in dark lines that looked more like scratches than letters. He scanned the first page, his heart pounding as he read the words.

[P45] “‘The forest is alive. I thought it would be safe here, but it watches, waits. Shadows move in the night, and there are whispers I can’t ignore. I am not alone. The Veil is not protection—it’s a curse. And it’s calling me… drawing the darkness closer.’”

[P46] The words settled over them like a thick, heavy fog, each line a whisper of dread that seemed to echo in the silence.

[P47] Sari’s face was pale, her gaze fixed on the journal as though it held some unspeakable truth. “He… really believed something was out there.”

[P48] Griffin crossed his arms, his jaw set in a hard line. “Or he was just losing his mind. Being out here alone could do that to anyone.” But there was a hint of unease in his voice, a flicker of doubt that he couldn’t quite hide.

[P49] Talon felt the weight of the journal in his hands, the words echoing in his mind, mingling with the memory of his vision. He didn’t know why, but he felt a strange connection to this person, this “D.H.” It was as if their paths had crossed somehow, bound together by the same invisible thread that had drawn him into the forest.

[P50] “Whether he was losing his mind or not… he saw something,” Talon said quietly, his voice barely more than a whisper. “Something that scared him enough to leave this behind.”

[P51] Griffin’s face tightened, his gaze shifting to the medallion hanging around Talon’s neck. “You really think we’re supposed to trust the ravings of some stranger? This whole place feels like a trap, Talon. We’re walking into something we don’t understand.”

[P52] Talon met Griffin’s gaze, feeling the weight of his doubt pressing down on him. “I don’t expect you to understand, Griffin. But I can’t ignore this. It’s like… the medallion brought us here. It’s connected somehow.”

[P53] Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s arm, her touch grounding him, her gaze filled with quiet resolve. “Then we keep reading. Maybe… maybe there’s something here that can help us.”

[P54] Griffin looked away, his jaw clenched, but he said nothing more. The silence stretched between them, thick and unyielding, as they settled into the cabin, the journal’s words lingering in their minds like a dark, unspoken warning.
