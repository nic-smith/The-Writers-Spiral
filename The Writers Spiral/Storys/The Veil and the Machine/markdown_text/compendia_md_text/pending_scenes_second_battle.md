## Scene

The forest’s stillness shattered as the hum of approaching drones filled the air. It started as a faint vibration in the ground, then grew to a metallic roar that rattled the trio’s nerves. Talon’s heart sank as the first wave of drones burst through the treetops, sleek machines swarming like angry hornets.

“Incoming!” Griffin shouted, gripping his sword tightly.

The drones didn’t just attack. Small, spider-like devices rained down from their undercarriages, landing in the dense underbrush around them. The mechanical bugs skittered with terrifying speed, their segmented legs carrying them closer to the trio. One jumped onto Talon’s leg, its pincers snapping as he batted it away.

“What the hell are these things?” Sari yelled, swiping at another that crawled onto her shoulder.

Before anyone could answer, one of the creatures leapt at Sari’s neck, its needle-like appendage stabbing her skin. She let out a sharp cry as electricity coursed through her body. Her knees buckled, and she collapsed to the ground.

“Sari!” Griffin bellowed, his voice breaking with panic. He lunged at the nearest drone, swinging his sword in wild frustration. The blade carved through the air, but the machines were too fast.

The bugs swarmed, their numbers overwhelming. Talon tried to focus, gripping his medallion, but the chaos made it impossible to think. Griffin’s rage boiled over as he swung his sword again, this time with everything he had.

And then it happened.

The sword stopped mid-swing, hanging in the air as though it had struck an invisible wall. Griffin staggered forward, his momentum broken, and fell to his knees. The blade began to vibrate, a low hum emanating from its core. Griffin’s eyes widened in shock as he saw faint green glyphs along the hilt light up, pulsing rhythmically.

Talon’s medallion responded instantly. A searing heat spread from his chest as the medallion’s power surged, pulling him into a trance. His vision blurred, replaced by a swirling void filled with countless eyes. This time, Griffin’s silhouette appeared in the periphery of his vision. Their eyes met briefly before Griffin’s form flickered and disappeared.

In the real world, gravity seemed to warp. The forest around them groaned as trees bent inward, their trunks snapping like brittle bones. A deafening pulse erupted from the sword, an explosion of energy that tore through the swarming drones and bugs, reducing them to charred fragments. The wave of power rippled outward, flattening the underbrush and silencing the forest.

Talon collapsed, his body drained of energy. His mind reeled from the vision, the overwhelming power, and the stark realization that none of this was within their control.

When he woke, pain shot through his side. He groaned, clutching his ribs, and looked up to see Griffin standing over him. Sari was draped over Griffin’s shoulders, unconscious but breathing.

“Get up,” Griffin said tersely, his voice sharp with frustration. He delivered another quick kick to Talon’s side.

“I—” Talon tried to speak, but Griffin was already walking away, carrying Sari toward what little safety the forest might still hold.

Talon pulled himself to his feet, clutching the medallion tightly. As he stumbled after Griffin, his mind raced. The vision. The sword. The Veil. Whatever had happened, it was clear they were in deeper than they’d ever imagined.

## Notes
- **Eidolons:** Two shadowy figures lingered at the edge of the battle, their forms flickering as they observed. They made no move to intervene, their glowing eyes focused intently on the trio. Their presence hinted at Metis’s constant surveillance.
- **Griffin’s Sword:** The interaction between the sword and the medallion is a pivotal moment, emphasizing the Veil’s latent power.
- **Character Dynamics:** Griffin’s anger and protectiveness over Sari, combined with his frustration at their situation, contrast with Talon’s helplessness and Sari’s vulnerability.
- **Foreshadowing:** The first shared vision between Talon and Griffin suggests a deeper connection to the Veil’s mysteries.
