### **Chapter 4: Veil’s Influence and the First Betrayal**

**Purpose**: To bring the Talon-Griffin conflict to a head, demonstrate the Veil’s unsettling influence, and introduce the first major betrayal within the group.

1. **Environmental Tension and Conflict**:
   - The group encounters **discarded tech fragments** tangled in tree roots, producing faint, glitchy hums that make the forest feel tainted by Metis. These environmental details suggest Metis’s influence extends beyond technology, invading nature itself.

2. **Confrontation Between Griffin and Talon**:

   - Tension culminates when **Griffin tries to forcibly take the medallion** from Talon, leading to a physical struggle. Talon defends himself, accidentally unleashing a burst of power from the Veil.

3. **Sari’s Intervention and Foreshadowing of Fracture**:
   - Sari stops the confrontation, taking a firmer stance on keeping the group united, but the rift is evident. Griffin withdraws, feeling betrayed, and Talon’s guilt and self-doubt deepen, with the Veil’s whispers subtly encouraging him to embrace its power.

**Purpose**: To explore the aftermath of Griffin’s betrayal, Talon’s struggle with the Veil, and the looming threat of Metis’s influence as the group grows more fractured.

1. **Physical and Emotional Exhaustion**:
   - After the conflict with Griffin, the group is tense and weary.

2. **Veil’s Influence on Talon**:
   - Talon becomes increasingly tempted to surrender to the medallion’s power, feeling it could be a source of protection. His visions intensify, showing a world where Metis has become a god-like entity. These images unsettle him, reinforcing the stakes of his struggle.

3. **Griffin’s Isolation and Growing Distrust**:
   - Griffin distances himself, reflecting on his mistrust and his failed attempt to take the medallion. His protective instinct for Sari is twisted by his paranoia, which has reached a point where he questions his loyalty to the group. He becomes a volatile element within the team.

4. **Cliffhanger – Metis’s Growing Presence**:
   - Just as the group tries to recover, Talon hears faint, static-filled whispers that seem to echo from his medallion, hinting that Metis may be actively attempting to reach him through the Veil. This revelation leaves the group on edge, setting up further confrontation with Metis’s influence.
