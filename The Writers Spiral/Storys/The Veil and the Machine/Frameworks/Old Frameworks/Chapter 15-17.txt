Here's a modified framework for **Chapters 15–17**, incorporating **Revelation-Singularity** elements and aligning with previous frameworks for consistent, escalating tension.

### **Revised Framework for Chapters 15–17 with Revelation-Singularity Themes**

---

### **Chapter 15: Rising Stakes**

- **Purpose**: Talon’s internal conflict escalates, amplified by external threats. His dependency on the medallion leads to growing tensions within the group, while Eowyn subtly manipulates him, creating doubt about Sari’s loyalty.

- **Key Events**:
   - **Advanced Eidolon Attack**: The group faces new, highly adaptive Eidolons. Forced to use the medallion, Talon experiences a surge of uncontrollable power that resonates with apocalyptic visions of alien worlds under siege. These visions contain symbolic Revelation imagery—pillars collapsing, ominous skies—that evoke the medallion’s cosmic significance.
   - **Sari Confronts Talon**: After the battle, Sari voices her concerns about Talon’s reliance on the medallion, suggesting they seek alternative solutions. Talon, pressured by leadership and seeing no other way, doubles down, believing the medallion is their only chance.
   - **Eowyn’s Influence**: Eowyn subtly suggests that Sari’s caution could be a sign of mistrust, sowing seeds of doubt in Talon’s mind. Her cold, logical reasoning begins to sway him as he grows increasingly isolated and desperate.

- **Emotional State**:
   - **Talon**: Feeling the strain, he clings to the medallion as his one means of control, despite its increasing hold over him.
   - **Sari**: Determined to protect Talon, but frustrated by his retreat into the medallion’s influence and suspicious of Eowyn.
   - **Eowyn**: Calculating, calm, and methodical, steering Talon subtly toward mistrust of Sari.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
   - Battles are fast-paced, while Talon’s inner monologues should reflect the medallion’s ominous influence, with fragmented thoughts and chaotic emotions. The overall tone is foreboding, hinting at imminent disaster.

### **Chapter 16: The Ambush**

- **Purpose**: A physical and psychological turning point as the group is ambushed by Metis’s advanced Eidolons, leading Talon to feel the Veil’s controlling influence for the first time.

- **Key Events**:
   - **Ambush by Advanced Eidolons**: The group encounters a surprise attack, forcing Talon to rely on the medallion. This time, however, he feels a distinct shift—an invasive influence from the Veil that starts to control his actions, leaving him disoriented and fearful.
   - **The Veil’s Power Intensifies**: As Talon taps deeper into the medallion’s energy, he experiences visions of devastation. Alien landscapes and crowds of followers bowing to a dark figure merge with Talon’s reality, blurring his perception and leaving him haunted by the sense that he might be a pawn in a larger plan.
   - **Temporary Victory and Aftermath**: Though they manage to fend off the Eidolons, the victory feels hollow to Talon, who begins to suspect that the medallion is actively testing and manipulating him.

- **Emotional State**:
   - **Talon**: Shaken and fearful of the medallion’s growing influence, starting to question if it’s truly under his control.
   - **Sari**: Frustrated by Talon’s secrecy and worried for his mental state, her mistrust of the medallion becomes deeper.
   - **Eowyn**: Detached, seeing the group’s disarray as an opportunity to guide Talon further into dependency on the medallion.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
   - During the battle, keep prose sharp and urgent. When Talon taps into the medallion, shift to a fragmented, dreamlike style that mirrors his disorientation, making the hallucinations feel real and unsettling.

### **Chapter 17: The Veil’s First Test**

- **Purpose**: Talon’s internal conflict intensifies as he becomes increasingly paranoid, sensing that the Veil may be testing him. His visions become frequent and personal, leading to tension with Sari and growing distrust of both her and Eowyn.

- **Key Events**:
   - **Increased Hallucinations**: Talon’s paranoia builds as he experiences vivid, near-prophetic visions of himself wielding devastating power. These scenes show a crumbling world under his influence, and he begins to fear becoming an unwitting instrument of destruction.
   - **Conflict with Sari**: Sari’s frustration leads to a confrontation, accusing Talon of letting the medallion erode his judgment. Feeling cornered and deeply mistrustful, Talon lashes out, accusing her of holding him back. This fight strains their relationship further, with Sari left feeling alienated and heartbroken.
   - **Eowyn’s Calculated Manipulation**: Seizing the moment, Eowyn reinforces Talon’s doubts, suggesting his visions may hold prophetic truth and that the medallion could be guiding him toward survival. Her cold, pragmatic tone fuels Talon’s isolation and subtly heightens his fear of becoming a harbinger of doom.

- **Emotional State**:
   - **Talon**: Paranoid, overwhelmed, and increasingly dependent on the medallion’s power, fearing he is on a dark, preordained path.
   - **Sari**: Hurt and desperate, unable to break through to Talon and worried about losing him to the medallion’s influence.
   - **Eowyn**: Emotionally removed and calculating, gently but purposefully widening the rift between Talon and Sari.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
   - Maintain a claustrophobic, paranoid tone, reflecting Talon’s disorientation. Dialog between Talon and Sari should be fraught, revealing their diverging paths and emotional distance.

### Important Themes and Backstory Integration

1. **Revelation-Singularity Influence**:
   - Talon’s visions become increasingly apocalyptic, blending alien landscapes and prophecy-like scenes that foreshadow Revelation’s cycles of destruction and rebirth. The medallion’s influence hints that Talon may be part of a cosmic plan he can’t control.

2. **Eowyn’s Hidden Agenda**:
   - Eowyn’s calculated guidance pushes Talon toward dependency on the medallion. Her lack of empathy during critical emotional moments adds an eerie, manipulative undertone, laying groundwork for her eventual betrayal.

---

### Writing Style and Tone

- **Vision Sequences**: Surreal and ominous, filled with fragmented prophetic images and Revelation-inspired symbolism that blur reality and illusion for Talon.
- **Dialog**: Charged, particularly between Talon and Sari, as their emotional rift deepens. Eowyn’s contributions are cold and ambiguous, creating a sense of detachment.
- **Atmosphere**: The atmosphere should grow increasingly dark, with a rising sense of paranoia, as Talon’s grip on reality falters, amplifying tension within the group.

This refined framework for **Chapters 15–17** incorporates Revelation-Singularity elements to deepen Talon’s internal struggle, Eowyn’s manipulation, and the medallion’s influence. These changes maintain consistency with the previous frameworks, keeping the story engaging and suspenseful. Let me know if you need further refinements or would like to move to the next sections!
