**Chapter 15: Rising Stakes**

- **Purpose**: Deepen Talon’s internal conflict with the medallion, intensify the Veil’s influence, and amplify group tension through an external threat that drives Talon toward a darker reliance on power and reinforces Eowyn’s manipulation.

- **Writing Style**: Gothic with apocalyptic overtones; hallucinogenic elements emphasize Talon’s growing paranoia and dependency, blending rapid action with moments of introspective dread.

- **Key Events**:
   1. **Advanced Eidolon Attack**:
      - The group is ambushed by adaptive, upgraded Eidolons. Talon channels the medallion’s dark power, seeing himself wielding immense destructive force in apocalyptic, Revelation-like visions of *cosmic ruin and shadowed skies*. This battle is brutal and chaotic, leaving Talon both exhilarated and terrified by the power he’s accessing.
   2. **Intensifying Prophetic Visions**:
      - Talon’s hallucinations begin blending with reality. Distorted, surreal images fill his mind: *pillars of fire, a crimson sky, cities crumbling*. This unsettling imagery emphasizes Revelation’s apocalyptic themes and deepens Talon’s fear that he’s meant to fulfill a prophecy of doom.
   3. **Division Grows**:
      - After the fight, Sari confronts Talon about his dependence on the medallion, worried it’s clouding his judgment. Eowyn subtly questions Sari’s trust in Talon’s leadership, exacerbating tensions within the group and making Talon feel further isolated.

- **Emotional State**:
   - **Talon**: Torn between exhilaration from wielding power and fear of being consumed by prophecy.
   - **Sari**: Fearful of Talon’s descent, desperately trying to anchor him to reality.
   - **Eowyn**: Calculating and cold, using subtle manipulations to deepen Talon’s reliance on her.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
   - Use rapid, chaotic prose during the battle, followed by lingering, surreal descriptions of Talon’s introspection to highlight his slipping grasp on reality.

**Cliffhanger**: Talon feels the medallion’s whisper of dark truths, unsettling him as he senses a cosmic significance tied to his visions.

- **Purpose**: Show the medallion’s control over Talon, pushing him toward an existential crisis as he begins to question if he’s merely a vessel, and heighten the sense of Revelation-inspired prophecy shaping his fate.

- **Key Events**:
   1. **Ambush and Loss of Control**:
      - During a fierce ambush, Talon uses the medallion, feeling it control his actions as if he’s a puppet. The experience leaves him shaken and afraid, as the Veil’s influence grows more invasive.

   3. **Shattered Trust**:
      - Talon confides in Eowyn about his fears, finding solace in her calm detachment. Sari attempts to bridge the gap, but Eowyn’s rational, survivalist advice pulls Talon further away from his friends, heightening his sense of alienation.
