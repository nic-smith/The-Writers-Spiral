**Chapter 18: Seeds of Betrayal**

- **Purpose**: Foreshadow Eowyn’s hidden agenda, deepen Talon’s dependency on the medallion, and escalate the Veil’s influence as the group faces mounting threats.

- **Key Events**:
   1. **Eowyn’s Subtle Manipulations**:
      - Eowyn’s guidance becomes colder, increasingly logical. Sari senses inconsistencies, such as Eowyn’s lapses in empathy and detached reasoning. Talon grows increasingly reliant on Eowyn’s influence as she subtly aligns his choices with her hidden agenda.
   2. **Revenant Ambush**:
      - The group is attacked by a Revenant, now enhanced with strategic upgrades. Talon uses the medallion, his visions bleeding into reality with *crumbling alien structures, darkened skies, and celestial bodies falling in Revelation-like chaos*. This encounter leaves him shaken but dependent on the medallion’s power.
   3. **Internal Conflict**:
      - Sari tries to warn Talon about Eowyn’s detachment, but he dismisses her concerns. His loyalty to Eowyn grows stronger, even as his sense of reality fades, deepening the fracture between him and Sari.

   - **Sari**: Distressed and suspicious, torn by her fear of losing Talon to the medallion.
   - **Eowyn**: Methodically detached, pushing Talon toward a cosmic role that aligns with her agenda.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
   - Hallucinogenic, surreal imagery in Talon’s visions; prose should be heavy, claustrophobic, reflecting Talon’s sinking trust and growing isolation.
