Talon felt the familiar weight of the Veil pressing against his mind, but this time, it was different—stronger, more forceful. His breath quickened as the world around him started to blur, the forest fading away, replaced by shadows and indistinct shapes. He tried to resist, to pull back from the vision, but the Veil’s grip tightened, dragging him deeper.

In the vision, he stood alone in a vast, empty field. His friends were nowhere to be seen. The ground beneath him cracked and shifted, glowing faintly with the same eerie light that emanated from the Veil. He looked down at his hands and recoiled—they were no longer his own. They were twisted, blackened, the fingers long and claw-like, pulsating with the Veil’s dark energy.

Suddenly, he saw them—Sari, Griffin, and the rest of the group—emerging from the shadows, but they didn’t recognize him. They stared at him with horror, backing away as if he were the enemy. His heart pounded in his chest as he tried to speak, to tell them it was still him, but no words came. Instead, the Veil spoke for him, and the words were not his own.

“Kill them.”

Talon’s vision-self moved forward against his will, his monstrous hands reaching out toward his friends. He fought with every ounce of his being to stop, to resist, but the Veil’s power surged through him, controlling his every movement. He could see the terror in their eyes, feel their fear as they scrambled to escape him.

And then it happened. His hand lashed out, striking Griffin first. The force of the blow sent Griffin crashing to the ground, motionless. Talon screamed inside his own mind, but his body wouldn’t stop. He was a puppet, a vessel for the Veil’s will, and it was using him to destroy the people he cared about most.

Sari cried out, her voice filled with pain and betrayal. “Talon! No!”

The vision shattered. Talon gasped for air, his hands trembling violently. The forest around him snapped back into focus, and he stumbled, nearly collapsing from the shock of what he had just seen. He gripped the wrist cuff tightly, his knuckles white with the effort.

The Veil whispered again, softer this time, as if mocking him. “Soon.”

He doubled over, trying to regain control of his breathing, but the fear lingered, gnawing at him. Was this his fate? Would the Veil eventually consume him, turning him into the very thing he feared? And worse—would it make him hurt the people he was trying to protect?

Talon swore under his breath, vowing silently that he would never let it come to that. But deep down, the doubt remained.


The forest had grown darker, the shadows around them thickening as the day slipped into evening. The trees, which had once offered some semblance of cover, now felt like they were closing in. Griffin led the way, his eyes darting nervously around them as they searched for a place to rest. Sari followed close behind, her face pale and strained from the constant fear that had plagued them since the pursuit began.

“Talon, we can’t keep running like this,” Griffin whispered harshly, glancing back at him. “We need to find cover, something—anything—to hide us from those things.”

Talon nodded, his throat too dry to speak. He could still feel the residual terror of the vision clinging to him, but he pushed it aside. Now wasn’t the time for doubts or fear. They needed to survive.

They stumbled upon a cave hidden beneath the gnarled roots of an ancient tree, the entrance small and barely noticeable in the fading light. Griffin crouched down, motioning for them to follow. “In here,” he whispered. “It’s not perfect, but it’ll give us some cover.”

The three of them crawled inside, their movements slow and careful, trying not to disturb the silence of the forest around them. The cave was cramped and cold, the air damp and musty. Talon leaned against the rough stone wall, trying to steady his breathing. He could feel the Veil stirring again, but he fought to keep it at bay.

Sari huddled next to him, her eyes wide with exhaustion and fear. “Do you think they’ll find us?” she whispered.

Griffin shook his head, his jaw clenched. “Not if we stay quiet. Just... don’t move.”

For several agonizing moments, they sat in silence, the only sound the faint rustling of leaves outside. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, every nerve in his body on high alert. And then, he heard it—a faint, metallic clicking sound, growing louder by the second.

His blood ran cold.

The Eidolons were near.

Griffin’s eyes widened as he heard the sound too. He gestured for them to press further back into the cave, their movements slow and deliberate. Talon held his breath, his muscles tense, ready to move at a moment’s notice.

The clicking grew louder, followed by the unmistakable sound of mechanical limbs skittering across the forest floor. Talon’s pulse quickened. The Eidolons were close—too close.

And then, just outside the cave’s entrance, he saw it. The dark, spindly form of an Eidolon, its glowing red eyes scanning the area. It stopped for a moment, its head tilting as if it had caught the scent of something.

Talon felt Sari stiffen beside him, her breath catching in her throat. He reached out, placing a hand on her arm, silently willing her to stay still. They couldn’t afford to make a sound.

The Eidolon moved closer, its sharp limbs scraping against the rocks as it crept toward the entrance of the cave. Talon’s heart raced, his mind screaming at him to move, to do something, but he knew that any sudden movement would give them away.

The creature paused at the entrance, its head swiveling as it scanned the darkness inside. Talon’s muscles ached from holding his position, but he didn’t dare move. He could hear Griffin’s breathing, slow and controlled, as they waited, hoping the Eidolon wouldn’t find them.

After what felt like an eternity, the Eidolon finally turned away, its mechanical limbs clicking as it retreated into the forest. Talon let out a shaky breath, his body trembling from the adrenaline. They had been lucky—this time.

Griffin exhaled slowly, his voice barely above a whisper. “We can’t stay here long. They’ll be back.”

**[p1]** **Chapter 1:**

The trees clawed at the sky, their twisted branches like skeletal fingers. Shadows flickered, warping the outlines of the forest, a place that held secrets from their past. Talon’s breath hitched—memories of their last encounter with the Eidolons flooded his mind, whispers of the Veil creeping into his thoughts. Was the forest watching them, or was it all in his mind?

**[p3]** The air was thick with tension, a suffocating weight pressing down on the group. Talon could feel it—the strain in every breath, in every uncertain glance they exchanged. The forest was too quiet, the kind of silence that made you feel like you weren’t alone. The scent of decaying leaves filled his nose, the faintest hint of rot lingering beneath it, souring the already oppressive atmosphere.

Griffin’s voice cut through the silence, sharp and accusatory.

Talon didn’t turn to face Griffin; he could feel the tension radiating off him. The Veil tugged at him, whispering cryptic guidance—warnings from their previous encounters echoing in his mind. Every step forward felt like a risk, a gamble with something far darker than they could comprehend.

**[p6]** Griffin’s patience snapped. He stormed up behind Talon, grabbing his arm. “We’ve been running in circles, and you don’t even know what you’re running from anymore!” Fear flickered in his eyes, hiding beneath his anger. His need to protect had twisted into frustration—at Talon, at the situation, at his own helplessness.

**[p7]** Talon yanked his arm free, but the motion felt hollow, his frustration barely masking the rising panic. “You think I wanted this? You think I wanted the Veil to rip apart everything I know?” His voice cracked under the weight of the words, the raw truth behind them forcing its way through. The Veil whispered again, louder this time, pressing against his thoughts, muddling his sense of self. He wasn’t sure if he was still Talon, or just a vessel for something darker. The helplessness twisted in his gut, making him feel like he was teetering on the edge of a precipice with no way out.

Sari Aydin had been watching silently, her heart pounding as she sensed the rising tension between Talon and Griffin. Memories of past battles with the Eidolons flashed in her mind, igniting her fear. Taking a steadying breath, she stepped in, determined to hold the group together. ‘Enough. This isn’t helping.’

**[p9]** Talon glanced at her, catching the hint of strain behind her sarcasm. Sari always had a way of cutting through tension, but even her sharp wit couldn’t fully hide the unease creeping in. Still, it was enough to pull Griffin back from the brink.

**[p10]** Griffin exhaled sharply. “We need to move faster. We’re wasting time,” he muttered, though his anger had lost its edge.

**[p11]** Sari kept her steps steady, though her lips twitched slightly in a humorless smile. “Right, because running in circles has been such a brilliant plan.” Her sarcasm cut through the tension, but the fear flickering in her eyes was unmistakable. “Talon’s doing what he can. We have to keep moving and think on the run. Standing here isn’t helping anyone.”

Sari’s words barely registered, her voice fading into the background as the Veil wrapped tighter around his mind. Doubt coiled around him, tightening its grip. Was he losing himself to this force? The weight of her fear made it all the more real, igniting a flicker of urgency in his chest.

Griffin’s glare could burn through steel. “You’re going to get us killed if you keep trusting that thing,” he growled, though the fear behind his words was unmistakable.

**[p14]** Talon clenched his fists. Griffin wasn’t just mad—he was scared, and so was Talon. Worse, part of him feared Griffin might be right.

**[p15]** The earth beneath them vibrated with an unnatural rhythm, not the tremble of shifting ground, but something more sinister—mechanical. Talon’s instincts flared, his grip tightening around the cuff on his wrist. His heart hammered in his chest as he scanned the surroundings—the path ahead wasn’t just twisting in his mind. Something was fundamentally wrong.

The Eidolons moved with an unsettling grotesqueness, their limbs creaking and groaning, like the friction of rusted bone grinding against metal.

**[p17]** “Get down!” Talon’s voice cracked with urgency, and they hit the ground just as a sharp, hissing sound ripped through the air. Griffin swore, eyes wide, as one of the mechanical forms lunged, its metallic limbs gleaming in the dim light. Talon’s hand burned as the Veil surged through him, a raw instinct overtaking him. His body moved faster than his mind could process, his reflexes unnervingly sharp as the world blurred around him, guiding him through the chaos.

AI-controlled horrors, they were the twisted remains of failed experiments, now more predator than machine.

**[p19]** “Move, now!” Griffin’s voice cut through the chaos, his grip tight on Sari’s arm as he yanked her toward the trees. Talon’s body moved before he could think, his limbs reacting with unnatural speed. Behind them, the **Eidolons** skittered across the forest floor with terrifying precision, inches from their heels. The trees provided just enough cover to give them a slim chance at escape.

**[p20]** As they broke free of the immediate threat, Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps, his mind spinning. The Veil had saved them, but the cost was heavy. His vision blurred, and for a moment, he couldn’t remember how they had escaped. He looked at his friends—Griffin was seething, Sari was shaking, but they were alive. Barely.

**[p21]** The forest was a maze of twisted trees and uneven ground, and each step felt heavier than the last. The cold mist coiled around Talon’s ankles like chains, pulling him back, trying to keep him tethered to the darkness. He could feel the weight of the Veil pressing against his mind, distorting everything. He had to keep moving, even though his limbs felt like lead.

**[p22]** “We need to split up!” Griffin shouted over his shoulder, his voice hoarse with urgency. He didn’t wait for a response, already dragging Sari in one direction, their movements barely more than a blur in the fog.

**[p23]** Talon’s instincts screamed at him to follow, but something—something from the Veil—pulled him in the opposite direction. His heart hammered in his chest as the whispers grew louder, guiding his steps toward a darker path, one that felt wrong and familiar at the same time.

**[p24]** The fog thickened, swallowing the trees around him, and Talon could barely see beyond a few feet. But he didn’t stop. The Veil surged inside him, its power both a curse and a lifeline. It was leading him—somewhere. He just didn’t know where.

as the low growl morphed into an unnerving whisper, mimicking familiar voices, twisting his perception of reality.

**[p26]** “Talon!” Sari’s voice pierced through the fog like a desperate cry for help, and for an agonizing second, he froze, caught between the suffocating pull of the Veil and the sound of her voice. His chest tightened as her face emerged from the swirling mist, pale and terrified. “Please, Talon,” she gasped, her breath ragged and uneven. “We can’t lose you too.” Her words were more than fear—they were a plea, raw and filled with the vulnerability she so often hid. The weight of it crushed him, and for the first time, he felt the full force of what his descent into the Veil might mean—for all of them.

**[p27]** He blinked, shaking off the fog that had clouded his mind. Sari was there, and so was Griffin, looming behind her like a shadow. They hadn’t left him behind. He forced himself to take a breath, to focus. The Veil’s whispers still lingered, but they were quieter now, more distant.

**[p28]** “This way,” Griffin muttered, his voice rough, his eyes scanning the forest with the intensity of a predator. “We don’t have time.”

**[p29]** Talon didn’t argue. His body moved on autopilot, his legs carrying him forward, though his mind was miles away. The shadows danced at the edges of his vision, and he could still feel the Veil tugging at him, but it was quieter now, like a dull hum in the back of his skull.

**[p30]** They ran, their footsteps barely more than whispers in the thick fog. The world around them seemed to twist and warp, the trees growing closer, the ground uneven beneath their feet. Talon’s chest burned with each breath, but he didn’t dare stop.

their shifting forms darting between the trees, fluid and unnatural, like living nightmares stalking their prey.

**[p32]** “‘They’re closing in!’ Sari’s voice cracked, the sharp edge gone, replaced by a breathless urgency. Her bravado had shattered—now only fear remained.

**[p33]** Griffin didn’t look back. His grip tightened on the knife in his hand, his muscles tensing as though he were ready to fight. “Keep running. We’re almost there.”

**[p34]** Talon didn’t know where ‘there’ was, but he followed, trusting Griffin’s instincts. The Veil thrummed against his mind, its power rising again, pushing him forward, but it was taking everything he had not to let it consume him.

**[p35]** The ground beneath them shifted again, a tremor running through the earth. Talon stumbled but caught himself before he hit the ground. The fog wrapped around them like a living thing, heavy and oppressive, while the trees loomed closer, their twisted forms casting jagged shadows that seemed to claw at the group’s dwindling path.

**[p36]** “This way!” Griffin’s voice was sharp as he veered left, disappearing into the mist. Talon and Sari followed without hesitation, their feet pounding against the uneven ground.

**[p37]** The world twisted, the fog swallowing everything in its path, and Talon felt a strange sense of déjà vu, like he’d been here before. But it wasn’t just familiarity—it was the **Veil**, showing him things he didn’t want to see, things he couldn’t understand.

**[p38]** His vision blurred, and for a moment, the trees around him flickered, morphing into something else—something darker, something alive. He blinked, and the image was gone, but the sensation lingered, crawling under his skin.

**[p39]** “Talon!” Sari’s voice snapped him out of the fog, and he realized he had stopped. His feet were rooted to the ground, his mind caught somewhere between reality and whatever nightmare the **Veil** was showing him.

**[p40]** “We can’t stop!” Griffin growled, his hand grabbing Talon’s arm and pulling him forward. “You have to fight it!”

**[p41]** Talon’s muscles screamed in protest, but he forced himself to keep moving, his feet stumbling over the uneven ground. The whispers of the Veil grew louder in his head, more insistent, but he pushed them aside, focusing on the sound of Griffin and Sari’s footsteps ahead of him.

**[p42]** His body felt disconnected from his mind, like he was floating through the forest on autopilot. The mist thickened around them, swallowing the world, and for a moment, Talon could barely make out the figures of his friends ahead. The air was cold and wet against his skin, the weight of the Veil pressing harder.

**[p43]** He caught sight of Griffin ahead, his back rigid as he led them through the fog, his eyes scanning the shadows with a relentless intensity. Sari was just behind him, her breath coming in quick, shallow gasps. Her usual sharpness had dulled, and Talon could see the fear etched in her face. They were all exhausted.

**[p44]** Another sharp metallic screech rang through the forest, closer this time. Talon’s blood ran cold as he recognized the sound. The Eidolons were closing in, their mechanical limbs slicing through the fog with eerie precision.

**[p45]** “Faster!” Griffin’s voice broke through the fog, urging them onward, but Talon’s legs felt like lead. His lungs burned with every breath, and his body begged him to stop, to rest, but the Veil pushed him forward, whispering that they couldn’t stop now. Not yet.

**[p46]** The ground beneath him shifted again, the tremors more violent this time, and Talon stumbled. He hit the ground hard, the impact knocking the air from his lungs. His vision flickered, the world spinning around him, and for a moment, he thought he might pass out.

**[p47]** Sari was there in an instant, her hand gripping his arm, her eyes wide with fear. “Talon, get up!” she hissed, her voice sharp with urgency. “We don’t have time!”

**[p48]** Talon groaned, pushing himself to his feet, his legs trembling beneath him. The Veil pulsed in his mind, stronger now, more demanding, and he felt his body responding to it, moving faster than his thoughts could keep up with.

**[p49]** “They’re right behind us!” Sari’s voice broke, her eyes wide with terror as they flicked toward the creeping shadows. The sharp edge she normally carried was gone, stripped away to reveal the trembling fear beneath. Her breath came in desperate, shallow gasps, and for a moment, Talon saw the fragile mask she wore crumble. The vulnerability she had hidden behind snide remarks and bravado was laid bare, and in that instant, it was as if all the walls she had built to protect herself shattered. She wasn’t just afraid—she was terrified, and it made Talon’s own fear surge tenfold.

**[p50]** Griffin didn’t stop. His muscles tensed, his eyes sharp, his hand gripping the knife at his side as though he was preparing to fight. “We need to keep moving,” he growled, his voice low but steady.

**[p51]** Talon’s legs moved without his consent, each step mechanical as the Veil commandeered his body like a puppet on strings. Its power surged through his veins, burning and fraying the edges of his consciousness. With every movement, he felt the sharp pull of the Veil tightening, digging deeper into his mind. He wasn’t just losing control of his body—he was losing himself. Each step stole another piece of him, leaving behind only the cold, hollow presence of the Veil, and the terrifying realization that he was becoming something less human with every breath.

A horrifying, staccato clicking echoed through the trees, a sound not of machines but of something distinctly alive, a symphony orchestrating their every move.

**[p53]** “We’re not going to make it!” Sari’s voice broke through the fog, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her eyes were wide with fear, and for the first time, Talon saw the cracks in her facade. She was terrified.

**[p54]** “Keep moving!” Griffin’s voice was a bark, sharp and unrelenting, but the tightness in his shoulders betrayed him. He didn’t look back, didn’t falter, but Talon could see it—the tension coiled in his muscles, the barely contained fear rippling beneath his skin. It wasn’t just anger or resolve pushing Griffin forward now—it was sheer, trembling fear. The kind of fear that makes you run even when your body’s about to break, even when the weight of everything is about to crush you. And Griffin was holding it together by a thread.

**[p55]** The trees loomed closer, their twisted branches reaching out like claws, and Talon felt the ground shift beneath his feet again. His body moved faster, the Veil pushing him forward, but his mind was starting to unravel. The whispers were louder now, more insistent, and he could feel the weight of their pull dragging him deeper into the Veil’s influence.

**[p56]** His vision blurred, and for a moment, the world around him seemed to flicker. The shadows twisted, the trees bending and warping into strange, nightmarish shapes. He blinked, trying to clear his vision, but the images lingered, haunting him.

**[p57]** A sharp screech pierced the air, and Talon’s heart skipped a beat. The Eidolons were close—too close. He could hear the mechanical whirr of their limbs, the rhythmic click of their movements. They were faster now, more precise, and Talon knew they were running out of options.

**[p58]** “There!” Griffin pointed ahead, his voice rough with urgency. Talon squinted through the fog, his heart pounding as he saw the faint outline of an opening in the trees. A way out.

**[p59]** “Go!” Sari urged, her voice tight with fear as they sprinted toward the opening. Talon’s legs burned with every step, his lungs aching for air, but he pushed forward, the Veil guiding him even as his mind screamed at him to stop.

**[p60]** They burst through the trees, the fog dissipating slightly as they stumbled into a small clearing. Talon gasped for breath, his vision swimming as the world tilted around him. He could hear the Eidolons behind them, the screeching growing louder, but for now, they had a moment’s reprieve.

**[p61]** “How long do you think we’ve got?” Sari’s voice was barely above a whisper, her eyes darting around the clearing as though she expected the trees to close in on them again.

**[p62]** Griffin shook his head, wiping the sweat from his brow. “Not long. They won’t stop.”

**[p63]** Talon glanced at the trees surrounding them, his mind racing. The Veil pulsed in the back of his skull, urging him to move, to run, but his body was exhausted. His muscles ached, his lungs burned, and his mind felt like it was unraveling with every second that passed.

**[p64]** “We need to keep moving,” Griffin said, his voice low but filled with determination. “We can’t stay here.”

**[p65]** “We’re running blind,” Sari muttered, but her voice trembled, barely holding back the exhaustion that clung to every word. The edge of frustration was there, but underneath, it was something rawer—weariness, fear, doubt. “How much longer, Griffin?” Her gaze flicked to him, and for the first time, the question didn’t feel rhetorical. She needed an answer, something—anything—to hold onto, because she was running out of strength to keep this facade going.

**[p66]** “As long as it takes,” Griffin snapped, his gaze locking with hers. His jaw clenched, his fists tightening at his sides. “We don’t have a choice.”

**[p67]** Talon felt the tension between them like a physical weight. The fear was gnawing at all of them, threatening to tear them apart. He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to shut out the whispers of the Veil, but they only grew louder, pushing against the edges of his mind.

**[p68]** “We need to head west,” Talon said, his voice hoarse, barely audible. The Veil’s pull was undeniable now, tugging at him, guiding him toward something, though he didn’t know what.

**[p69]** Griffin’s eyes narrowed. “Why west?”

Talon hesitated, and Sari’s heart twisted. She wished she could reassure him, but her own anxieties clawed at her. What if the Veil was more than they thought? What if it took him from her? She pushed the thought aside, forcing a smile as she moved closer to him.

**[p71]** For a moment, Griffin looked like he was about to protest, but he didn’t. He just nodded, his expression grim. “Fine. West.”

**[p72]** Sari bit her lip, her eyes darting between them. “Let’s hope the Veil knows what it’s doing.”

**[p73]** Without another word, they pushed forward, their footsteps muffled by the thick underbrush. The forest closed in around them again, the fog swirling in the air like a living thing. The trees loomed over them, their branches twisting and bending in the mist, and Talon felt the weight of the Veil pressing down on him even harder.

**[p74]** The ground beneath them was uneven, the roots and rocks making every step treacherous. Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps, his body aching with every movement, but he couldn’t stop. Not now.

**[p75]** The screeching sound of the Eidolons was distant now, but it lingered in the air, a constant reminder that they were being hunted. Talon’s mind was a blur of exhaustion and fear, the Veil’s whispers swirling around him, pulling him deeper into its grasp.

**[p76]** “Are we even going the right way?” Sari’s voice was laced with doubt, her breath coming in short gasps. “Or is this just another one of the Veil’s tricks?”

**[p77]** Talon didn’t answer. He couldn’t. His mind was too clouded, too tangled with the Veil’s influence to make sense of anything. All he could do was keep moving, keep following the pull that tugged at him like a leash around his neck.

**[p78]** Griffin glanced back at him, his brow furrowed with concern. “Talon, are you sure about this?”

**[p79]** “No,” Talon admitted, his voice barely a whisper. “But it’s all we’ve got.”

**[p80]** They moved in silence for what felt like hours, the fog thickening around them, the trees growing closer, more menacing. The air was cold and damp, the ground slick with moss, and every step felt like a battle against the elements.

**[p81]** Talon’s legs buckled under the weight of the Veil’s presence, every step dragging him deeper into its clutches. It wasn’t just whispering now—it was shouting, flooding his mind with voices he couldn’t shut out, filling his head with foreign thoughts and urges he didn’t want to acknowledge. His limbs moved not from his own will, but from a force far stronger, far darker, pulling him toward something he couldn’t resist. The deeper he went, the more alien his own body felt, as though he were walking a path forged not by choice but by the relentless grip of the Veil tightening around his soul.

**[p82]** The forest seemed to close in around them, the trees bending and warping as though they were alive. Talon’s breath caught in his throat as the shadows shifted at the edges of his vision, the fog swirling in strange patterns that made his head spin. He blinked, trying to clear his mind, but the whispers of the Veil grew louder, more insistent.

**[p83]** Griffin slowed, glancing over his shoulder. “We need to rest,” he said, his voice low but firm. “We’re no good if we’re dead on our feet.”

**[p84]** Sari’s breathing was ragged, her face pale with exhaustion. “He’s right,” she gasped, leaning heavily against a tree. “We need a break.”

**[p85]** Talon’s legs screamed in protest, his muscles trembling with fatigue, but the Veil tugged at him, urging him to keep going. “We don’t have time,” he muttered, though his voice was barely audible. “They’re still out there.”

**[p86]** “We’ll be dead if we don’t stop,” Griffin growled, his eyes locking with Talon’s. “Five minutes. That’s all we need.”

Talon hesitated, and Sari’s heart twisted. She wished she could reassure him, but her own anxieties clawed at her. What if the Veil was more than they thought? What if it took him from her? She pushed the thought aside, forcing a smile as she moved closer to him.

**[p88]** He nodded, sinking down against a tree, his breath coming in shallow gasps. The forest seemed to pulse around him, the shadows shifting and warping, and he felt the Veil thrumming in his skull, the whispers growing louder with every passing second.

**[p89]** Sari collapsed next to him, her hand shaking as she wiped the sweat from her forehead. “This is insane,” she muttered, her voice laced with fear. “We’re running on fumes. How much longer can we keep this up?”

**[p90]** Talon didn’t have an answer. The Veil tugged at him, whispering things he couldn’t quite grasp, but he knew they couldn’t stop—not for long. The Eidolons were still out there, hunting them. Waiting.

**[p91]** Griffin stood, his eyes scanning the forest around them, his muscles tense. “We move in five,” he said, his voice low but steady. “No more.”

**[p92]** Talon nodded, his hand instinctively brushing the cuff on his wrist. The Veil pulsed against his skin, a cold, alien presence that both comforted and terrified him. He closed his eyes, trying to block out the whispers, but they were always there, waiting.

**[p93]** The forest was unnervingly still, the mist swirling around them like it was alive. Talon could feel the weight of the Veil pressing down on him, pulling him deeper into its grip, and he fought to keep his mind clear.

**[p94]** Sari shifted next to him, her breath shallow, her eyes wide with fear. “What if we don’t make it?” she whispered, her voice trembling. “What if this is it?”

**[p95]** Talon swallowed hard, the weight of her words sinking into his chest. He didn’t have an answer. The Veil tugged at him, whispering things he didn’t want to hear, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that she might be right.

**[p96]** “We’ll make it,” Griffin said, his voice firm, though there was a flicker of doubt in his eyes. “We have to.”

**[p97]** The silence stretched between them, the only sound the distant hum of the Eidolons, their mechanical limbs slicing through the fog as they hunted. Talon’s pulse raced, his mind spinning with exhaustion and fear.

**[p98]** “Time’s up,” Griffin muttered, his muscles tensing as he straightened. “We move. Now.”

**[p99]** Talon’s body screamed in protest, but he pushed himself to his feet, the weight of the Veil pressing down on him harder than ever. His vision blurred, the world around him warping as the whispers grew louder, more insistent. But he couldn’t stop. Not now.

**[p100]** Sari rose slowly, her legs shaking, her face pale. She glanced at Talon, her eyes filled with fear. “Are you okay?” she whispered, her voice soft, almost fragile.  # Assuming other parts of the chapter remain integrated.

The forest grew darker as they pushed forward, the thick canopy above blotting out the last traces of daylight. The path ahead was barely visible, a winding trail that seemed to lead nowhere. Talon kept his eyes on the ground, focusing on each step, trying to ignore the weight of the Veil pressing against his mind.

Suddenly, he froze, his heart skipping a beat. There, etched into the bark of a massive tree just ahead, were strange symbols—symbols he had seen before in his visions.

“Wait,” he whispered, holding up a hand to stop Sari and Griffin. His pulse quickened as he approached the tree, his fingers tracing the faint carvings. They were crude and weathered, but there was no mistaking them. These were Veil markings.

Griffin stepped closer, his brow furrowed. “What is it?”

Talon didn’t answer immediately. His mind raced, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. The markings were ancient, far older than the tree itself, as if they had been burned into the wood by some otherworldly force. The lines swirled and twisted in a pattern that was both familiar and alien, and as he stared at them, he could feel the Veil stirring, as if it recognized the symbols.

“These... these are from the Veil,” Talon finally said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Sari’s eyes widened, and she stepped closer to get a better look. “What does it mean?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, his fingers still tracing the carvings. “But these symbols... they’ve been here for a long time. Someone—something—was here before us.”

Griffin’s expression darkened. “And what does that mean for us?”

Talon shook his head, stepping back from the tree. His mind was racing, the weight of the Veil pressing harder against his thoughts. “It means we’re not the first ones to encounter the Veil. There were others—others who knew about it, who tried to leave their mark.”

Sari glanced at the symbols, her brow furrowed. “But why would they leave these markings here? What were they trying to say?”

Talon didn’t have an answer. The symbols were a mystery, one he wasn’t sure he wanted to unravel. But as he stood there, staring at the ancient carvings, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were a warning. A warning from those who had come before—those who had been consumed by the Veil.

“We need to keep moving,” Talon finally said, his voice tense. “We’re getting closer to something. I can feel it.”

Griffin shot him a wary glance. “Closer to what?”

Talon didn’t respond. He wasn’t sure what they were getting closer to. But whatever it was, the Veil was pulling them toward it, and there was no turning back now.


They were finally alone for the first time in hours, though the oppressive weight of the forest pressed in on them even here, making it hard to breathe. Griffin sat across from Sari, his back against the rough stone wall of the cave, his jaw clenched in frustration.

Sari broke the silence first, her voice barely above a whisper. “How much longer do you think we can keep this up?”

Griffin didn’t respond at first. His eyes were fixed on the entrance of the cave, his thoughts miles away. Finally, he spoke, his voice tight with tension. “I don’t know. But we can’t run forever.”

Sari hesitated, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of her sleeve. “Do you think Talon can handle it? The Veil, I mean. I’ve seen how it’s affecting him. He’s not the same.”

Griffin’s gaze hardened, and he looked away. “I don’t know, Sari. I don’t know if any of us can handle what’s coming.” His voice wavered for a moment, betraying the fear he was trying so hard to suppress. “But if he can’t control it... we might not survive.”

Sari felt a lump form in her throat. She had been thinking the same thing, but hearing it from Griffin made it real, made it terrifying. She glanced over at Talon, who was leaning against the cave wall, his eyes closed as if he were resting, but she knew better. He wasn’t resting. He was fighting a battle none of them could see.

“What do we do if he loses control?” Sari asked, her voice trembling.

Griffin didn’t answer immediately. When he did, his words were cold and final. “We stop him. No matter what.”

Sari’s stomach twisted in knots at the thought, but she didn’t argue. She couldn’t. Deep down, she knew Griffin was right.


As they continued their trek through the forest, Sari found her thoughts drifting back to a time before all of this—before the Veil, before the endless running, before they became prey. She glanced at Talon, who was walking a few paces ahead, his shoulders tense, his eyes constantly scanning the woods.

It hadn’t always been like this.

Sari remembered the first time she met Talon. It was during the Festival of Lights, a time of celebration and hope in their village. Talon had been different back then—lighter, more carefree. He had that infectious grin that could make anyone feel like the world wasn’t such a terrible place.

They had spent that entire evening talking, laughing, and wandering through the festival, the glow of lanterns reflecting in their eyes. She could still remember the way his face lit up when he talked about his dreams—dreams of exploration, of discovering the world beyond their village. He had always been the adventurous one, the one who believed there was more out there waiting for them.

But those days felt like a lifetime ago.

Now, that carefree Talon was gone, replaced by someone weighed down by the darkness of the Veil. The person walking ahead of her was a stranger in many ways—someone she could barely recognize anymore. And yet, despite everything, she couldn’t shake the memories of who he used to be.

She wanted that Talon back. She wanted to believe that the man she had shared that night with was still in there somewhere, fighting to break free from the Veil’s grasp.

But as the shadows of the forest deepened around them, Sari wasn’t sure if that Talon would ever come back.


The river loomed ahead of them, its dark waters churning violently as it rushed over jagged rocks. The sound of the water crashing against the stones was deafening, drowning out any other noise. Talon eyed the river warily, his stomach tightening with unease.

“We have to cross,” Griffin said, his voice grim. “It’s the only way.”

Sari hesitated, her eyes scanning the river. “Are you sure? That current could sweep us away.”

Talon swallowed hard, feeling the weight of the decision. The river looked dangerous—too dangerous. But the sound of the Eidolons in the distance left them no choice. If they stayed on this side, they wouldn’t survive.

“We don’t have time to argue,” Talon said, stepping toward the riverbank. “We have to go now.”

Griffin was the first to wade into the icy water, the current immediately pulling at him, threatening to drag him downstream. He gritted his teeth and pushed forward, his muscles straining against the force of the water.

Sari followed, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps as the cold water soaked through her clothes, the current tugging at her legs. Talon was the last to enter, and the moment his feet touched the riverbed, he felt the freezing water surge around him, almost knocking him off balance.

The three of them struggled to stay upright as they crossed, the water rising higher with every step. The rocks beneath them were slippery, and more than once, Talon had to reach out to steady himself against Griffin or Sari to keep from falling.

By the time they reached the opposite shore, they were soaked to the bone, their bodies trembling from the cold and exhaustion. But they had made it.


As they pushed deeper into the forest, the trees thinned, giving way to a clearing that felt out of place amidst the thick, overgrown wilderness. In the center of the clearing stood what remained of an old outpost—crumbling stone walls covered in vines, half-buried by the passage of time.

Talon stopped in his tracks, his eyes scanning the ruins. “What is this place?” he muttered under his breath.

Griffin approached the nearest wall, running his hand over the cold stone. “It’s old,” he said, his voice low. “Really old.”

Sari stepped forward, her gaze sweeping across the ruins. “Do you think this was... human?”

Talon knelt by one of the larger stones, brushing away the dirt and moss that had collected over the years. As his fingers traced the surface of the stone, he noticed something—faint markings, almost invisible beneath the layers of decay.

“These symbols... they’re similar to the ones we saw on the tree,” Talon said, his voice tense.

Sari crouched beside him, her brow furrowed. “What do they mean?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, but his heart raced as he realized the implications. This outpost wasn’t just a relic of the past—it was connected to the Veil, just like the markings they had seen earlier.

Griffin glanced around the clearing, his expression wary. “Whoever built this place... they knew about the Veil. They were studying it, maybe even trying to control it.”

Talon stood, his mind racing with possibilities. “This place might hold answers,” he said, looking around. “Answers to what the Veil is, where it came from. But we don’t have time to search it now. The Eidolons could be on us any minute.”

Sari nodded, standing up as well. “We’ll come back,” she said. “When it’s safer.”

As they turned to leave, Talon cast one last glance at the outpost, his mind buzzing with questions. Whoever had been here before them had understood the Veil—perhaps better than they did. But whatever secrets the outpost held, they would have to wait. For now, survival came first.


As they made their way through the dense underbrush, Griffin’s frustration finally boiled over. He grabbed Talon by the arm, yanking him back with enough force to stop him in his tracks.

“We need to talk,” Griffin growled, his voice low but filled with anger.

Talon pulled his arm free, his eyes narrowing. “What is it?”

Griffin stepped closer, his jaw clenched, his eyes blazing with barely restrained fury. “This Veil—this thing you’re connected to—it’s going to get us killed. You need to stop trusting it.”

Talon stiffened, his chest tightening as Griffin’s words hit home. “You think I’m not aware of the risks? You think I’m doing this because I want to?”

Griffin’s fists clenched at his sides. “I don’t care why you’re doing it. All I know is that every time we trust that thing, we end up in worse shape than before. It’s messing with your head, Talon. You’re not the same person anymore.”

Talon’s temper flared, and he took a step forward, his voice rising. “I’m doing the best I can! The Veil... it’s our only chance. If we don’t use it, we’re dead. You know that.”

Griffin’s face hardened. “And what happens when you lose control, huh? What happens when it takes over completely? You think Sari and I will just stand by and watch while it turns you into a monster?”

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, the words cutting deeper than Griffin could have known. For a moment, they stood there, staring each other down, the tension between them thick enough to cut with a knife.

Finally, Talon turned away, his voice tight with barely controlled emotion. “I won’t let it come to that. I swear.”

Griffin didn’t look convinced, but he said nothing more. The conversation was over—for now.
