Talon’s heart thundered as the ground shifted beneath him. The air thickened with mist, punctuated by the unmistakable screech of metal against stone—a sound reminiscent of grinding bones mixed with rusted gears.

They were coming.

“Move!” Griffin shouted, but Talon’s legs felt paralyzed. The Veil twisted through his veins, its whispers surging louder, gripping him tighter. His breath hitched, and the fog blurred into a shapeless mass. He couldn’t see. Couldn’t think.

A scream tore through the air. Sari.

“Sari!” Talon yelled, but her voice, usually sharp with sarcasm, broke with raw terror. He turned, lurching forward, but his feet skidded on slick earth. Sari was ahead, blood streaking her forehead, her wide eyes brimming with panic.

Another shriek—inhuman—ripped through the fog, heavier than sound; it clawed at Talon’s thoughts, twisting them.

“Go, go!” Sari’s voice cracked, breath ragged as she scrambled to her feet.

An icy chill crawled up Talon’s spine. His pulse thudded louder, his mind reeling as the Veil hissed in his ears. It was happening again. He was losing control, and now it might cost Sari everything.

The Eidolons were closer. He could almost feel them, their presence vibrating through the ground, a low hum rattling up into his bones. The screech of their limbs resembled insect wings beating too fast, too close.

“Keep moving! Don’t stop!” Griffin’s voice cut through the noise, but it barely registered in Talon’s hazy mind. His hands trembled, his vision swimming as the Veil twisted around his thoughts. He was going to lose her. He was going to lose everyone.

Then the Veil’s voice whispered: Let go.

Letting go wasn’t an option. Not now.

The Eidolons broke through the fog, shifting unnervingly, their limbs twisting and reshaping. Tendrils of metal stretched outward and recoiled like mechanical sinew. They didn’t just walk; they flowed forward, their movements too fluid, too unnatural.

Their presence transcended the physical; Talon felt the Veil reacting to them, whispers that didn’t belong to him echoing in his mind. The Eidolons were alive in ways he couldn’t comprehend. Their faintly glowing eyes flickered, scanning every thought he tried to form.

“Get down!” Talon urged. They hit the ground just as a sharp, hissing sound ripped through the air. Griffin swore, eyes wide, as one of the mechanical forms lunged, its limbs blurring into a twisted amalgamation of metal and flesh. Talon’s hand burned as the Veil surged through him, instinct taking over. His body moved faster than his mind, reflexes sharpened as the world blurred around him.

The Eidolons—AI-controlled enforcers twisted by a dark fusion of biology and technology—closed in from every direction. Their limbs pulsed with veins of organic material, far too human for comfort. The Veil pushed Talon’s body to its limits as he ducked and twisted through their assault. Each movement came at a cost; the pounding in his skull grew unbearable, and with every surge of energy, a part of his mind slipped further from his grasp.

Talon blinked hard, forcing focus. He had to control the chaos—couldn’t let them invade his mind like they tore through the fog. They weren’t just hunters; they were predators, hunting through fear and manipulation, as much as through metal and claws.

“Move, now!” Griffin shouted, tightening his grip on Sari’s arm, pulling her toward the trees. Talon’s body reacted on instinct, faster than thought. The Eidolons were right behind them, distorting and flickering like shadows that could never be fully seen.

They didn’t move like machines. They moved like living nightmares.

The trees offered just enough cover for a slim chance of escape. As Talon ran, he could sense the Eidolons—more than see them—skittering across the forest floor, mere inches from their heels. They didn’t tire. They didn’t falter. They would keep coming.
