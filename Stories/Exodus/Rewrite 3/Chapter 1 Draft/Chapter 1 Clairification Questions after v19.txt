1. Introduce Obstacles During the Escape
Unexpected Terrain: As the group flees, they encounter difficult terrain, such as a steep hill or a ravine, which requires them to make quick decisions that test their physical abilities and teamwork. This can create a sense of urgency and danger.
Eidolon Traps: Implement traps set by the Eidolons that the group must navigate. These could be pitfalls, sudden ambushes, or environmental hazards that force the characters to react quickly.
Answer) I strongly believe that the trio should loose something by falling down a ravine. They should tumble hard. Their genetic modification could help in this suitation however they need pain. Someone needs to smack hard against a tree, someone need a deep leg gash, and someone need to smash their hand and badly damage a finger on their dominate hand. This should slow them down. They are running completely blind and at full speed through woods; anything can happen. Lets add some more micro, minor, and major events outside of them falling down the ravine. This should impede their and bring them back to face the Ediolens.
2. Create Moments of Vulnerability
Physical Injuries: Have one character trip or get injured during the escape, making them a liability. This not only raises the stakes but also tests the group’s resolve and ability to support one another.
Answer) The person who hit the tree should have a concusion and be very daised. Let's not make that Talon. He already had too much going on in his head. Someone should vomit from the pain. The person with the gash in the leg should be slowed but not immobile.
Emotional Crises: Introduce moments where fear or doubt causes one character to freeze or hesitate, leading to close calls with the Eidolons. This can deepen the emotional stakes and add tension to their escape.
Answer) This freezing should not come with long interspection or dialog. This should be pure human fear. 
3. Enhance the Presence of the Eidolons
Active Pursuit: Instead of simply having the Eidolons in the background, show them actively hunting the group. Use sounds (e.g., cracking branches, eerie whispers) and close encounters to heighten the sense of danger.
Answer) There should be a moment where the Eidolons catch the group and Talon has to use powers granted by the Veil to defeat them. This will give us a chance to explore the Veil and something more than just a voice in Talons head. What we know is the Veil takes something from Talon ever time he uses it so we will have to explore that. Also Talon doesn't know how to use the Veil so this will be almost a misfire of sorts. Just something that happens due to the suitation and stress. Also we have not tied in the fact that the cuff is the source of the powers but the cuff is not the veil. The Veil is an alien artifact that exists somewhere else completely. This group has never seen the Veil. They only know that the cuff is something that Sari got Talon at the festivel of lights (from the backstory). Also, and this should not be explored here but just to keep in mind that there are other cuffs and other people tapping into the Veil. Sari, Griffin, and Talon don't know that at this time but they are out there. 
Tactical Intelligence: Portray the Eidolons as strategic predators. They could anticipate the group’s moves, creating scenarios where the characters must think on their feet to evade capture.
Answer) I like this. Feel free to explore this further. 
4. Introduce Time Pressure
Countdown to Threat: Add a time element, such as a signal indicating the Eidolons are closing in. This could be a noise or an event that creates urgency, forcing the characters to act quickly.
Answer) I like this too but let's make it background. Something to up the pressure but not something that takes over the nariative. 
Limited Escape Routes: Present situations where escape routes become blocked or collapse, forcing the group to adapt quickly and find alternative paths.
Answer) We haven't established a real good visual of where they are going or why they are going that way. Think of what it would look like if a drone was following our characters from the outside, how can we paint a clear path for our characters and give the reader a broader view of their path. The reader might see a path unexplored or see where the Eidolons are in the forest compared to our trio. Maybe the 50 foot view and show Eidolons breaking off to the left or the right to cut our trio off. Maybe we can explain how may Eidolons are actually hunting them. They should eventually catch up in a battle that requires the Cuff and the Veil to win.
5. Character Decisions with Consequences
Difficult Choices: Force the characters to make tough decisions that affect their escape. For example, they might have to choose between saving an injured member or risking their own safety to regroup.
Character Sacrifices: Consider a scenario where one character temporarily stays behind to buy time for the others. This can create emotional stakes and deepen character relationships.
Answer) Griffin is the protector and he would definitely stay back to buy time but we would have to tie in his frustration for being in this suitation due to the cuff. His dialog should be hero and marter. 
6. Foreshadowing Future Threats
Hints of Greater Dangers: While escaping, include subtle foreshadowing of what’s to come—strange sounds, fleeting shadows, or signs of larger threats that suggest their troubles are far from over.
Answer) We have another preditor that is stronger than the Ediolons. - This is hinted at during chapter 4 " **The Revenant’s Role**: While **The Revenant** serves as an adaptive predator, **The Eidolons** represent a more organized, intelligent threat, showing that Metis’s reach is far more dangerous than they initially realized."
