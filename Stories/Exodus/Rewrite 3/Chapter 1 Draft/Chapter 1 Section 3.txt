The darkness deepened around them, the forest now a shadowy maze of twisted branches and ominous silhouettes. The distant clicking of the **Stalker**’s limbs echoed through the trees, a persistent reminder that danger was closing in. Talon pushed forward, his steps growing heavier with every second. The **Veil**’s whispers clouded his thoughts, filling his mind with fragmented warnings that felt **nebulous** and distorted, a riddle wrapped in shadows.

Griffin’s breath was ragged behind him, frustration bubbling under the surface. He felt the heat of anger rising within him, tempered by a fear that gnawed at his insides. “We can’t keep going like this, Talon,” he growled, his voice strained with exhaustion. “You’re leading us into a trap, aren’t you? Do you even know what you’re doing?” 

Talon flinched but didn’t stop. The weight of the cuff on his wrist felt heavier than ever, the metal cold against his skin. The **Veil**’s pull was relentless, urging him forward, but every step felt like it could be a mistake. “We don’t have a choice,” Talon muttered, his voice barely more than a whisper. 

Griffin’s hand shot out, grabbing Talon by the arm and spinning him around. “Don’t give me that!” His eyes were wild, filled with anger and fear, but beneath it all, there was something deeper. Something Talon couldn’t ignore. “You brought us into this mess! You and that damn cuff!”

Talon’s chest tightened, a rush of guilt flooding through him. He knew Griffin was right—part of him had always known. The cuff, the **Veil**… none of it was supposed to be their burden. Yet here they were, running through a nightmare they couldn’t wake from. He wanted to tell Griffin he was sorry, that he hadn’t asked for this either, but the words caught in his throat.

“I didn’t want this,” Talon said, his voice shaky. “But we can’t stop now. Not with the **Stalker** on us.”

Griffin’s grip on his arm loosened slightly, the anger in his expression faltering for just a moment. Talon saw the conflict in his friend’s eyes—an unspoken war between resentment and something else. Something protective. Griffin’s need to keep them safe clashed violently with his blame toward Talon, and the weight of that battle seemed to tear at him from the inside.

Griffin swallowed hard, his jaw tightening as he looked away, unable to hold Talon’s gaze any longer. “You better be right,” he muttered, his voice softer now but still laced with bitterness. “If this thing gets us killed…”

Sari, who had been following in silence, stepped closer, her face a mask of tension. She shot Griffin a sharp look, her sarcasm bleeding through the cracks in her composure. “Yeah, yelling at him is definitely going to make all of this better,” she quipped, though her usual playful tone was dimmed by the fear gnawing at her.

Griffin didn’t respond, his expression hardening as he glanced at Sari. His frustration simmered beneath the surface, but Sari’s words had managed to cut through the worst of it, at least for now.

Sari sighed, her dark humor faltering. “Look, we’re all scared,” she said, her voice softening. “But fighting each other isn’t going to help. We need to trust each other if we’re going to get out of this.” 

Talon could feel the weight of her gaze on him, the empathy in her eyes more painful than the accusations. She was trying to hold them together, even as her own fear crept into her voice. He didn’t deserve her trust. He didn’t even trust himself.

“I’m trying,” Talon whispered, the words slipping out before he could stop them. His hands trembled, the cuff digging into his wrist as the whispers in his mind grew frantic, **guiding** him deeper into confusion.

Sari nodded, offering him a small, strained smile. “We know,” she said, her voice steady but laced with the same exhaustion that clung to all of them. “But we need to keep moving.”

The sound of the **Stalker**’s clicking limbs grew louder, closer. Griffin glanced back toward the darkness, his protective instincts kicking in again. “Fine,” he muttered, his voice low. “But if I see one more sign that this is a dead end, Talon…”

Talon didn’t wait for him to finish. He turned and started walking again, his mind racing, the **Veil** pulling him deeper into the unknown. Griffin’s anger still clung to him, but so did the unspoken care behind it. Even now, when everything was falling apart, Griffin was still trying to protect him. It made Talon’s chest ache in ways he couldn’t explain.

Sari fell in step beside him, her presence a quiet comfort. “We’ll figure it out,” she said softly, her voice barely audible above the sound of their footsteps. “Just don’t let the whispers drown you out.”

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure if he believed her. The whispers were growing louder, and the further they went, the harder it became to hear anything else.

The forest around them felt alive, its shadows twisting in the dim light, obscuring the path ahead. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung in the air, a constant reminder of the darkness that surrounded them. Talon could feel the weight of the forest pressing down on him, its **fowl** presence suffocating.

Suddenly, a low roar pierced the silence, echoing through the trees. Griffin froze, his body tense with fear. “What was that?” he whispered, glancing at Talon with wide eyes.

Talon swallowed hard, the sound sending chills down his spine. “I don’t know, but we need to keep moving.”

Sari’s hand brushed against Talon’s arm, grounding him. “Let’s just focus on putting one foot in front of the other,” she urged, her voice steady despite the fear lacing her words. “We owe it to ourselves to keep going.”

With each step, the shadows seemed to **mash** together, the darkness closing in around them. Talon fought against the rising tide of doubt within him, clenching his fists around the cuff. The Veil’s whispers grew frantic, urging him to move faster, to trust it completely.

“We can’t stop,” he muttered, but the words felt hollow. He was starting to wonder if they were running toward safety or simply running in circles, deeper into an **obsolete** nightmare that would swallow them whole.

As they pressed on, the forest loomed larger and darker, each rustle of leaves sending shivers down their spines. Talon glanced at Griffin and Sari, their faces pale and etched with fear. They were all in this together, bound by the shadows that pursued them, and he couldn’t afford to falter now.

With that thought echoing in his mind, he quickened his pace, the darkness enveloping them as they ventured deeper into the unknown. 


As they pressed on, the shadows seemed to close in tighter, and the forest's oppressive weight grew heavier. Talon's mind raced, each whisper from the **Veil** becoming more frantic. He tried to focus, to hone in on a path, but the shadows danced before his eyes, teasing him with uncertainty.

“Maybe we should have taken a different route,” Griffin muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. The tension in his tone cut through the silence like a knife, each word laden with regret.

Sari shot him a sideways glance. “And end up even more lost? I think we’re doing a fine job of that already,” she replied, her sarcasm tinged with desperation. “Besides, it’s not like we had a map of the **fowl** creatures lurking in this nightmare.” 

Talon tried to appreciate the humor in her words, but a knot formed in his stomach. The fear they all shared felt like a living entity, clawing at their sanity with every passing moment. The sense of being hunted grew stronger, and he felt it—an electric thrill of terror that coursed through him, urging him to run faster.

Suddenly, the underbrush rustled to their left, and Talon froze. His heart raced as he strained to hear over the pounding in his ears. The sound was unmistakable—something was following them.

“Did you hear that?” Talon whispered, his voice trembling as he turned to the others. Griffin’s eyes widened, and Sari’s grip tightened around his arm, a silent question hanging in the air.

“Keep moving!” Griffin barked, his protective instincts kicking in again. “We can’t let it catch up to us.”

The urgency in his voice pulled Talon from his paralysis, and he surged forward, adrenaline flooding his veins. But the fear settled deeper in his chest. What if they were running toward danger instead of away from it? The thought was like ice water in his veins, freezing him momentarily as the whispers in his mind clamored for attention.

As they rounded a bend in the path, Talon spotted a large tree with a gnarled trunk, its branches twisted like **obsolete** sculptures against the night sky. “We can hide there,” he said, pointing. “It might give us some cover.”

Sari nodded, urgency overtaking her sarcasm. “Let’s go!” She moved ahead, guiding Griffin, who hesitated for just a moment, casting one last glance over his shoulder, as if expecting the **Stalker** to leap from the shadows.

They ducked behind the tree, hearts pounding in their chests. The sound of their breaths echoed in the silence, mixing with the rustle of leaves above. Talon pressed his back against the rough bark, feeling the pulse of the forest around him. 

“What do we do now?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper. 

Griffin’s brow furrowed as he peered into the darkness. “We wait and listen. If it’s close, we’ll hear it.”

Talon nodded, but his mind was a flurry of thoughts. “We can’t stay here too long. If we’re found—” 

The distant **roar** of the **Stalker** cut through the night, sending a fresh wave of panic surging through Talon. They had to move, had to find safety. 

“Do you think it can smell us?” Griffin asked, his voice shaking. 

“Maybe,” Talon replied, biting his lip. “We can’t take that chance.” He glanced at Sari, searching for her unwavering confidence. She was the anchor he needed, the one who believed in him even when he doubted himself.

“Okay, let’s wait until it passes, then we’ll keep moving,” Sari said, determination flickering in her eyes. “We can do this. Just stay quiet.”

The three of them huddled together, their hearts pounding in unison. Talon felt the weight of the moment bearing down on them, the realization that every decision, every step, could lead them closer to safety—or into the jaws of death.

As the eerie silence enveloped them, the tension became palpable, the darkness pressing in around them like a suffocating shroud. Talon’s mind raced, the whispers of the **Veil** swirling around him. He had to guide them through this. He owed it to them—to Griffin, who was torn between anger and love, and to Sari, who faced the horrors of the night with unyielding resolve.

They were in this together, bound by fear and determination, and as long as they stayed united, they stood a chance against the shadows that sought to consume them.
