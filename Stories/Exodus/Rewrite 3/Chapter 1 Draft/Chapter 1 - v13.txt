[Finalized rewrite of Chapter 1 with improved descriptions and emotional depth]

Talon’s heart thundered in his chest as the ground shifted beneath him. The air was thick with mist, but the screech of metal against stone was unmistakable. They were coming.

“Move!” Griffin’s voice cracked through the fog, but Talon’s legs were frozen in place. The Veil, twisting through his veins, surged again—its whispers louder, its grip tighter. His breath hitched, the fog blurring into a shapeless mass. He couldn’t see. Couldn’t think.

A scream tore through the air. Sari.

“Sari!” Talon shouted, but her voice, usually so sharp with sarcasm, now broke with raw terror. He turned, his body lurching forward, but his feet skidded on the slick earth. Sari was ahead, stumbling, blood streaking her forehead, her wide eyes brimming with panic.

Another shriek—a sound that wasn’t human—ripped through the fog.

“Go, go!” Sari’s voice cracked, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she scrambled to her feet.

An icy chill crawled up Talon’s spine. His pulse thudded louder, his mind reeling as the Veil hissed in his ears. It was happening again. He couldn’t control it. He was losing himself to it, and now... now it might cost Sari everything.

The screech of the Eidolons was closer. Griffin’s voice cut through the noise, but it barely registered in the haze that clouded Talon’s mind. “Keep moving! Don’t stop!” But Talon’s hands were trembling, his vision swimming in and out as the Veil twisted around his thoughts, pulling him under. Sari’s scream echoed again. He was going to lose her. He was going to lose everyone.

And then the Veil’s voice—cold, relentless—whispered a command.

Let go.
