Talon’s heart thundered in his chest as the ground shifted beneath him. The air was thick with mist, but the screech of metal against stone was unmistakable. The sound wasn’t clean—it was like the grinding of broken bones mixed with rusted gears.

They were coming.

“Move!” Griffin’s voice cracked through the fog, but Talon’s legs were frozen in place. The Veil, twisting through his veins, surged again—its whispers louder, its grip tighter, more insistent. His breath hitched, the fog blurring into a shapeless mass. He couldn’t see. Couldn’t think.

A scream tore through the air. Sari.

“Sari!” Talon shouted, but her voice, usually so sharp with sarcasm, now broke with raw terror. He turned, his body lurching forward, but his feet skidded on the slick earth. Sari was ahead, stumbling, blood streaking her forehead, her wide eyes brimming with panic.

Another shriek—a sound that wasn’t human—ripped through the fog. But this time, it wasn’t just sound. It carried something heavier, like a presence that dug into Talon’s mind. It clawed at his thoughts, twisting them.

“Go, go!” Sari’s voice cracked, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she scrambled to her feet.

An icy chill crawled up Talon’s spine. His pulse thudded louder, his mind reeling as the Veil hissed in his ears. It was happening again. He couldn’t control it. He was losing himself to it, and now... now it might cost Sari everything.

The Eidolons were closer. Not just closer—he could almost feel them. Their presence wasn’t just a sound, it was in the air itself, a low hum that rattled through the ground and up into his bones. The screech of their limbs was like an insect’s wings beating too fast, too close to his ears.

Griffin’s voice cut through the noise, but it barely registered in the haze that clouded Talon’s mind. “Keep moving! Don’t stop!” But Talon’s hands were trembling, his vision swimming in and out as the Veil twisted around his thoughts, pulling him under. Sari’s scream echoed again. He was going to lose her. He was going to lose everyone.

And then the Veil’s voice—cold, relentless—whispered a command.

Let go.

But letting go wasn’t an option. Not now.

The Eidolons broke through the fog, and Talon could finally see them. Their bodies shifted unnervingly, their limbs twisting and reshaping as they moved, tendrils of metal stretching outward and recoiling back like mechanical sinew. They didn’t just walk—they flowed forward, their movements too fluid, too unnatural. 

And worse still, their presence wasn’t just physical. Talon could feel the Veil reacting to them, could hear whispers that didn’t belong to him. The Eidolons were alive in ways he couldn’t understand. Their eyes—glowing faintly—flickered as if scanning every thought he tried to form.

“Get down!” Talon’s voice cracked with urgency. They hit the ground just as a sharp, hissing sound ripped through the air. Griffin swore, eyes wide, as one of the mechanical forms lunged, its limbs moving in a blur of twisted metal and flesh. Talon’s hand burned as the Veil surged through him, a raw instinct overtaking him. His body moved faster than his mind could process, his reflexes unnervingly sharp as the world blurred around him, guiding him through the chaos.

The Eidolons—AI-controlled enforcers twisted by some dark fusion of biology and technology—closed in from every direction. Their limbs weren’t just metal; they pulsed with veins of organic material, something far too human for comfort. Talon could feel the Veil pushing his body to its limits as he ducked and twisted through the assault. Each movement came at a price—the pounding in his skull grew unbearable, and with every surge of energy, a part of his mind seemed to slip further from his grasp.

Talon blinked hard, forcing his mind to focus. He had to get control—he couldn’t let them get into his head, couldn’t let them tear him apart mentally the way they tore through the fog physically. They weren’t just hunters—they were predators in every sense of the word. Hunting through fear, through manipulation, as much as through metal and claws.

Griffin’s shout tore him back to the moment. “Move, now!” His grip tightened on Sari’s arm, pulling her toward the trees. Talon’s body moved on instinct again, faster than his thoughts. The Eidolons were right behind them, their bodies distorting and flickering like shadows that could never be fully seen.

They didn’t move like machines anymore. They moved like living things, twisted into mechanical nightmares.

The trees provided just enough cover to give them a slim chance of escape. But as Talon ran, he could feel the Eidolons—more than see them—skittering across the forest floor with terrifying speed, mere inches from their heels. They didn’t tire. They didn’t falter. They would keep coming.
