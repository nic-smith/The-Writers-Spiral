Chapter 1: Section 1

The trees loomed over them like a living canopy, the branches twisting grotesquely as though the forest itself was watching. Every step Talon took felt like the ground was trying to swallow him whole, the damp, moss-covered earth sucking at his boots. A low mist clung to the forest floor, swirling around their legs like fingers, cold and acidic against his skin.

The air was thick with tension, a suffocating weight pressing down on the group. Talon could feel it—the strain in every breath, in every uncertain glance they exchanged. The forest was too quiet, the kind of silence that made you feel like you weren’t alone. The scent of decaying leaves filled his nose, the faintest hint of rot lingering beneath it, souring the already oppressive atmosphere.

Griffin’s voice sliced through the stillness, sharp and accusing. “Do you even know where we’re going?” His frustration barely masked the desperation behind his words.

Talon didn’t turn to face Griffin; he didn’t need to. The **Veil** tugged at him, whispering cryptic guidance, but every step forward felt like a risk. “We can’t stop,” he muttered, though his voice came out thinner than he intended.

Griffin’s patience snapped. He stormed up behind Talon, grabbing his arm. “We’ve been running in circles, and you don’t even know what you’re running from anymore!” Fear flickered in his eyes, hiding beneath his anger. His need to protect had twisted into frustration—at Talon, at the situation, at his own helplessness.

Talon shook his arm free, irritation flaring. “I didn’t ask for this. You think I wanted the **Veil** to drag us into this nightmare?” His voice was sharp, but the pressure of the **Veil** only intensified. It whispered again, weaving through his thoughts, blurring the lines between choice and control.

Sari Aydin, who had been watching silently, finally stepped in. Her eyes darted between them, her usual sharp edge softened by strain. “Griffin, yelling isn’t going to help us,” she said, her voice steady but tinged with fatigue. “I’d love to believe you have a better plan.” The sarcasm was there, but beneath it, the cracks were beginning to show. Even Sari’s calm felt frayed.

Talon glanced at her, catching the hint of strain behind her sarcasm. Sari always had a way of cutting through tension, but even her sharp wit couldn’t fully hide the unease creeping in. Still, it was enough to pull Griffin back from the brink.

Griffin exhaled sharply. “We need to move faster. We’re wasting time,” he muttered, though his anger had lost its edge.

Sari’s lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained serious. “Right, because running blindly has worked out so well.” Her sarcasm was sharp, but it couldn’t mask the fear flickering in her gaze. “Talon’s doing the best he can, and we have to trust that. But we need more than just running. We need to think.”

Talon felt the weight of her words pressing on him, the **Veil** pushing even harder. Was this really his decision, or was the **Veil** pulling the strings? The doubt gnawed at him, tightening around his chest.

Griffin’s glare could burn through steel. “You’re going to get us killed if you keep trusting that thing,” he growled, though the fear behind his words was unmistakable.

Talon clenched his fists. Griffin wasn’t just mad—he was scared, and so was Talon. Worse, part of him feared Griffin might be right.

The forest around them twisted as the light dimmed further. A distant clicking sound—a metallic echo—sent a shiver through Talon. The **Stalker** was closing in.

“We don’t have time,” Talon muttered, quickening his pace. The **Veil** pressed harder on his mind, its whispers urgent but incomprehensible. Each step felt like a gamble, leading them deeper into the unknown.

Talon stumbled, catching his foot on a root. He barely stayed upright, his heart racing. Griffin’s growl behind him was unmistakable, but there was no time to stop.

The path ahead blurred, and Talon couldn’t tell if the forest was real or if the **Veil** was distorting his senses. His thoughts tangled as the **Veil** tightened its grip. He squeezed the cuff harder, forcing himself to focus. The whispers were growing louder, insistent.

“We need to move faster,” Talon muttered again, though the words felt distant. His vision swam, the strain of the **Veil** pulling him in every direction. He didn’t know if he was leading them to safety or straight into a trap.

Sari, noticing his struggle, moved closer. “Talon, you’re going to hurt yourself if you keep pushing like this,” she said softly, her voice steady but tinged with concern. Her calm was still there, but her empathy shone through. “We can’t survive if we break ourselves before we get there.”

But there was no time to stop. The clicking of the **Stalker**’s limbs grew louder—sharp, deliberate, like claws on stone. Too close.
