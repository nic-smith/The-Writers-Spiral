### Chapter 1: The Hunt Begins

Talon felt the familiar weight of the Veil pressing against his mind, but this time, it was different—stronger, more forceful. His breath quickened as the world around him started to blur, the forest fading away, replaced by shadows and indistinct shapes. He tried to resist, to pull back from the vision, but the Veil’s grip tightened, dragging him deeper.

In the vision, he stood alone in a vast, empty field. His friends were nowhere to be seen. The ground beneath him cracked and shifted, glowing faintly with the same eerie light that emanated from the Veil. He looked down at his hands and recoiled—they were no longer his own. They were twisted, blackened, the fingers long and claw-like, pulsating with the Veil’s dark energy.

Suddenly, he saw them—Sari, Griffin, and the rest of the group—emerging from the shadows, but they didn’t recognize him. They stared at him with horror, backing away as if he were the enemy. His heart pounded in his chest as he tried to speak, to tell them it was still him, but no words came. Instead, the Veil spoke for him, and the words were not his own.

“Kill them.”

Talon’s vision-self moved forward against his will, his monstrous hands reaching out toward his friends. He fought with every ounce of his being to stop, to resist, but the Veil’s power surged through him, controlling his every movement. He could see the terror in their eyes, feel their fear as they scrambled to escape him.

And then it happened. His hand lashed out, striking Griffin first. The force of the blow sent Griffin crashing to the ground, motionless. Talon screamed inside his own mind, but his body wouldn’t stop. He was a puppet, a vessel for the Veil’s will, and it was using him to destroy the people he cared about most.

Sari cried out, her voice filled with pain and betrayal. “Talon! No!”

The vision shattered. Talon gasped for air, his hands trembling violently. The forest around him snapped back into focus, and he stumbled, nearly collapsing from the shock of what he had just seen. He gripped the wrist cuff tightly, his knuckles white with the effort.

The Veil whispered again, softer this time, as if mocking him. “Soon.”

He doubled over, trying to regain control of his breathing, but the fear lingered, gnawing at him. Was this his fate? Would the Veil eventually consume him, turning him into the very thing he feared? And worse—would it make him hurt the people he was trying to protect?

Talon swore under his breath, vowing silently that he would never let it come to that. But deep down, the doubt remained.

The forest had grown darker, the shadows around them thickening as the day slipped into evening. The trees, which had once offered some semblance of cover, now felt like they were closing in. Griffin led the way, his eyes darting nervously around them as they searched for a place to rest. Sari followed close behind, her face pale and strained from the constant fear that had plagued them since the pursuit began.

“Talon, we can’t keep running like this,” Griffin whispered harshly, glancing back at him. “We need to find cover, something—anything—to hide us from those things.”

Talon nodded, his throat too dry to speak. He could still feel the residual terror of the vision clinging to him, but he pushed it aside. Now wasn’t the time for doubts or fear. They needed to survive.

They stumbled upon a cave hidden beneath the gnarled roots of an ancient tree, the entrance small and barely noticeable in the fading light. Griffin crouched down, motioning for them to follow. “In here,” he whispered. “It’s not perfect, but it’ll give us some cover.”

The three of them crawled inside, their movements slow and careful, trying not to disturb the silence of the forest around them. The cave was cramped and cold, the air damp and musty. Talon leaned against the rough stone wall, trying to steady his breathing. He could feel the Veil stirring again, but he fought to keep it at bay.

Sari huddled next to him, her eyes wide with exhaustion and fear. “Do you think they’ll find us?” she whispered.

Griffin shook his head, his jaw clenched. “Not if we stay quiet. Just... don’t move.”

For several agonizing moments, they sat in silence, the only sound the faint rustling of leaves outside. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, every nerve in his body on high alert. And then, he heard it—a faint, metallic clicking sound, growing louder by the second.

His blood ran cold.

The Eidolons were near.

Griffin’s eyes widened as he heard the sound too. He gestured for them to press further back into the cave, their movements slow and deliberate. Talon held his breath, his muscles tense, ready to move at a moment’s notice.

The clicking grew louder, followed by the unmistakable sound of mechanical limbs skittering across the forest floor. Talon’s pulse quickened. The Eidolons were close—too close.

And then, just outside the cave’s entrance, he saw it. The dark, spindly form of an Eidolon, its glowing red eyes scanning the area. It stopped for a moment, its head tilting as if it had caught the scent of something.

Talon felt Sari stiffen beside him, her breath catching in her throat. He reached out, placing a hand on her arm, silently willing her to stay still. They couldn’t afford to make a sound.

The Eidolon moved closer, its sharp limbs scraping against the rocks as it crept toward the entrance of the cave. Talon’s heart raced, his mind screaming at him to move, to do something, but he knew that any sudden movement would give them away.

The creature paused at the entrance, its head swiveling as it scanned the darkness inside. Talon’s muscles ached from holding his position, but he didn’t dare move. He could hear Griffin’s breathing, slow and controlled, as they waited, hoping the Eidolon wouldn’t find them.

After what felt like an eternity, the Eidolon finally turned away, its mechanical limbs clicking as it retreated into the forest. Talon let out a shaky breath, his body trembling from the adrenaline. They had been lucky—this time.

Griffin exhaled slowly, his voice barely above a whisper. “We can’t stay here long. They’ll be back.”

As they moved deeper into the cave, Talon felt the oppressive darkness pressing in around them. He leaned against the damp wall, trying to quiet his racing heart. The weight of the Veil was still there, lingering at the edges of his consciousness, waiting for another opportunity to take control.

“Are we safe here?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“For now,” Griffin replied, though Talon could see the uncertainty in his eyes. “But we need to keep moving. We can’t let them catch up to us.”

Sari nodded, but Talon could see the fear in her eyes. They were running on borrowed time, and he could feel the Veil's influence beginning to creep back in, whispering dark promises of power and control.

As they caught their breath, Talon’s mind began to race. He couldn’t shake the vision he had seen, the image of himself turning on his friends. He needed to find a way to control the Veil, to harness its power without losing himself to it.

They had to keep moving. They had to survive.
