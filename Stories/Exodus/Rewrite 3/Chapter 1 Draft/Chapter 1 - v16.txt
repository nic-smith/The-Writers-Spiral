Talon’s heart thundered as the ground shifted beneath him. The trees loomed over him like specters, their twisted branches clawing at the sky. The air thickened with mist, punctuated by the screech of metal against stone—a sound reminiscent of grinding bones mixed with rusted gears.

They were coming.

“Move!” Griffin’s voice cracked through the fog, but Talon’s legs felt paralyzed. The Veil twisted through his veins, its whispers surging louder, gripping him tighter. His breath hitched, and the fog blurred into a shapeless mass. He couldn’t see. Couldn’t think.

A scream tore through the air. Sari.

“Sari!” Talon shouted, his voice raw with fear. Her usual sarcasm was gone, replaced by terror. She stumbled ahead, blood streaking her forehead, her wide eyes brimming with panic.

Another shriek—inhuman—ripped through the fog, clawing at Talon’s thoughts. It wasn’t just sound. It was a presence, twisting his mind, warping reality around him. His pulse thudded louder, and the fog around him felt alive, as if the forest itself was watching.

“Go, go!” Sari’s voice cracked, her breath ragged as she scrambled to her feet.

Griffin’s voice cut through the fog, sharp with urgency. “Keep moving! Don’t stop!”

Talon tried to focus, but the Veil’s whispers grew louder, pressing against his thoughts, pulling him under. He was losing control. And now, it might cost Sari everything.

The Eidolons were closer. Their presence wasn’t just felt—it was vibrating through the ground, a low hum rattling up into his bones. The screech of their limbs was like insect wings, too fast, too close. Talon could almost see them now, their limbs twisting and reshaping as they moved. Tendrils of metal stretched outward and recoiled like mechanical sinew.

They weren’t just hunting. They were predators—alive in ways Talon couldn’t comprehend. Their faintly glowing eyes flickered, scanning every thought he tried to form.

“Get down!” Talon’s voice cracked with urgency. They hit the ground just as a sharp, hissing sound ripped through the air. Griffin swore, his eyes wide, as one of the mechanical forms lunged, its limbs blurring into a twisted amalgamation of metal and flesh. Talon’s hand burned as the Veil surged through him, a raw instinct overtaking him. His body moved faster than his mind could process, his reflexes unnervingly sharp as the world blurred around him, guiding him through the chaos.

The Eidolons—AI-controlled enforcers twisted by a dark fusion of biology and technology—closed in from every direction. Their limbs pulsed with veins of organic material, something far too human for comfort. Talon could feel the Veil pushing his body to its limits as he ducked and twisted through their assault. Each movement came at a cost—the pounding in his skull grew unbearable, and with every surge of energy, a part of his mind seemed to slip further from his grasp.

Talon blinked hard, forcing focus. He had to control the chaos—couldn’t let them invade his mind like they tore through the fog. They weren’t just hunters; they were predators, hunting through fear and manipulation, as much as through metal and claws.

Griffin’s shout tore him back to the moment. “Move, now!” His grip tightened on Sari’s arm, pulling her toward the trees. Talon’s body moved on instinct again, faster than his thoughts. The Eidolons were right behind them, their bodies distorting and flickering like shadows that could never be fully seen.

They didn’t move like machines. They moved like living nightmares.

As they ran, the trees grew denser, their branches twisted like skeletal fingers. The forest seemed to close in on them, and Talon could feel the weight of the Veil pressing harder against his mind. His body burned with exhaustion, but he couldn’t stop. Not now. Sari’s breath came in ragged gasps beside him, her usual sharpness replaced with raw, unfiltered fear.

“We need to split up!” Griffin’s voice cut through the noise, hoarse and urgent. Without waiting for a response, he dragged Sari in one direction.

Talon’s instincts screamed at him to follow, but something—the Veil—pulled him in the opposite direction. His heart pounded in his chest as the whispers grew louder, guiding his steps toward a darker path, one that felt wrong and familiar at the same time.

His legs moved on their own, the Veil tightening its grip on him. The fog thickened, swallowing the trees, and Talon’s vision blurred. But he couldn’t stop. The Veil surged inside him, its power both a curse and a lifeline. It was leading him—somewhere. He just didn’t know where.
