**framework for character backstory for Talon, Griffin, and Sari**
### **Chapter 1: The Beginning (Shared History)**

#### **Purpose**:
- Establish the foundation of their friendship and hint at the world they live in, where genetic modifications are normal.
- Highlight their bond, genetic enhancements, and subtle differences in how they handle their modifications.
- Lay the groundwork for Talon’s connection to the Veil through the wrist cuff.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Early Lives and Genetic Modifications**:
   - Each of the characters grew up in a world where genetic enhancements were widely accepted and common. They view their own modifications as normal, part of how society functions.
   - **Talon**: Modified for enhanced intelligence and creative thinking, his genetic modifications enhance his artistic abilities and abstract thinking, but they also make him more introspective and hesitant about using physical force.
   - **Griffin**: Modified for physical resilience and strength, Griffin’s genetic enhancements make him naturally protective and capable, but they also increase his aggressive tendencies, especially when under pressure.
   - **Sari**: Modified for heightened emotional intelligence and cognitive function, Sari’s modifications make her more perceptive and able to understand people deeply, which is both a strength and a burden as it increases her emotional load.

2. **First Encounters**:
   - The three meet through mutual interests (perhaps a school or community activity), where their genetic modifications are simply part of who they are, without fanfare. Their early interactions show how their modifications complement one another—Talon’s creativity, Griffin’s strength, and Sari’s intelligence all form a natural bond.
   
3. **Bonding Moments and Genetic Normalization**:
   - The trio navigates childhood and adolescence, using their enhancements without overthinking them. Griffin’s strength protects them in minor skirmishes, Sari helps mediate conflicts with her emotional intelligence, and Talon’s creativity fuels their imaginative escapades.
   - Their enhancements are subtly woven into their friendship, reinforcing that they are accepted as part of their identities but not the center of who they are.

4. **Emotional Foundations**:
   - Despite the ease with which they use their enhancements, deeper emotional undercurrents are present. Talon’s introspective nature hints at his internal struggles, Griffin’s protectiveness is rooted in trauma, and Sari’s scarsum masks her vulnerability. These dynamics set up future conflicts.

### **Chapter 2: Talon’s Story**

#### **Purpose**:
- Provide an in-depth look into Talon’s backstory, focusing on his internal struggles, genetic enhancements, and connection to the Veil.
- Explore Talon’s reluctance to fully embrace leadership and his deep emotional scars from the death of his brother Caleb.
- Introduce the wrist cuff and its significance without leaning into the "chosen one" trope.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Talon’s Genetic Modifications**:
   - Talon’s genetic modifications focus on cognitive and artistic abilities, giving him a heightened sense of creativity, but also an introspective nature that often pulls him into his own world. While this makes him a brilliant artist and thinker, it also leads to self-doubt and hesitation in moments of crisis.
   
2. **Caleb’s Death**:
   - Talon’s emotional scar comes from his brother Caleb’s death, which left a profound mark on him. He feels a deep sense of guilt over being unable to save Caleb and internalizes this as a fear of failing those he loves, including Sari and Griffin.
   
3. **The Wrist Cuff and Festival of Lights**:
   - During the **Festival of Lights** (or a similar celebration), Sari gives Talon the wrist cuff as a symbolic gesture, not realizing its true significance. Talon doesn’t choose the cuff; it becomes part of him by chance. This is a critical detail in avoiding the "chosen one" trope—Talon didn’t seek the Veil’s power, and the wrist cuff only later reveals its true nature.
   
4. **Subtle Influence of the Veil**:
   - Though the wrist cuff doesn’t immediately show its power, Talon begins experiencing subtle changes—dreams, visions, and occasional flashes of memories that don’t feel like his own. He doesn’t realize it yet, but the Veil is slowly starting to connect with him. These changes aren’t dramatic, adding to his internal conflict and fear that he’s losing himself.

5. **Talon’s Relationship with Griffin and Sari**:
   - Talon’s bond with Griffin and Sari is strong, but as the wrist cuff’s influence grows, he starts to distance himself emotionally. He fears the cuff and its potential, but also feels a growing responsibility to protect his friends from whatever power is emerging. This tension will be critical as the story progresses.

### **Chapter 3: Griffin’s Story**

#### **Purpose**:
- Explore Griffin’s past, focusing on his abusive father and the impact this had on his protective nature.
- Highlight his genetic enhancements and how they shape his view of the world, especially his frustration with Talon’s hesitance to use the Veil’s power.
- Show Griffin’s complex emotional journey and how it affects his relationship with Talon and Sari.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Griffin’s Abusive Father**:
   - Griffin’s childhood is marked by physical and mental abuse from his father, who was harsh and controlling. This upbringing instills in Griffin a fierce need to protect those he loves and a deep sense of distrust toward authority figures.
   - His father may have pushed for Griffin’s genetic modifications, wanting a strong, resilient child, and this forceful influence leaves Griffin conflicted about his own abilities. While he’s physically strong, the emotional toll of his father’s abuse makes it difficult for him to express vulnerability.

2. **Genetic Modifications**:
   - Griffin’s enhancements include physical resilience and heightened strength. He sees these as tools for protecting his friends, but they also contribute to his aggressive tendencies when under stress. His modifications make him feel capable of taking on dangers head-on, which sometimes puts him at odds with Talon’s more cautious approach.
   
3. **Protectiveness and Frustration**:
   - Griffin’s relationship with Talon is shaped by this protectiveness. He views Talon’s reluctance to use the Veil’s power as a weakness and struggles to understand why Talon doesn’t fully embrace his leadership role. Griffin’s frustration with Talon is rooted in his fear of losing him, which ties back to his unresolved trauma with his father.

4. **Relationship with Sari**:
   - Griffin’s dynamic with Sari is one of mutual respect, but they occasionally clash over Griffin’s protective nature. Sari’s scarsum (dark sarcasm) often diffuses tension between them, but Griffin finds it difficult to open up about his past, leaving their friendship occasionally strained.

5. **Emotional Vulnerability**:
   - Griffin struggles to show vulnerability, even with his closest friends. His abusive past creates a barrier that prevents him from fully trusting others with his emotions, making his protectiveness both a strength and a weakness.

### **Chapter 4: Sari’s Story**

#### **Purpose**:
- Delve into Sari’s backstory, emphasizing her independence, emotional intelligence, and scarsum.
- Explore her genetic modifications and how they heighten her emotional awareness, while also making her more vulnerable to emotional overload.
- Highlight her role as the mediator in the group and the toll this takes on her emotionally.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Sari’s Genetic Modifications**:
   - Sari’s enhancements focus on heightened emotional intelligence and cognitive abilities. She is perceptive, able to read people’s emotions and intentions quickly, which helps her navigate social dynamics. However, this also makes her more sensitive to emotional overload, and she sometimes struggles to maintain her own emotional stability.

2. **Use of Scarsum**:
   - Sari developed **scarsum** as a defense mechanism, using dark humor to shield herself from the emotional intensity she experiences. Her humor often helps diffuse tension in the group, but it also masks her deeper vulnerabilities, especially as she grows more concerned about Talon’s connection to the Veil.

3. **Relationship with Talon**:
   - Sari’s relationship with Talon is one of deep emotional connection, but it’s also strained by her growing concern over the wrist cuff. She gave it to him as a gift, never expecting it to have such a profound impact, and now she worries that the Veil is taking him away from her. Her scarsum is a way of coping with this fear.

4. **Relationship with Griffin**:
   - Sari and Griffin’s friendship is built on respect, but they sometimes clash due to Griffin’s overprotectiveness. Sari’s emotional intelligence allows her to understand Griffin’s trauma, but she also struggles with the emotional weight of mediating between him and Talon.

5. **Emotional Anchor**:
   - As the emotional center of the group, Sari feels the pressure to hold everything together. This takes a toll on her, and she occasionally wonders if she’s strong enough to keep mediating between Griffin’s frustration and Talon’s internal struggles.

.
- Foreshadow future conflicts and the growing tension around the Veil and their roles in the unfolding events.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Festival of Lights Incident**:
   - Sari gives Talon the wrist cuff as a gift, unaware of its deeper connection to the Veil. This moment is lighthearted at first, but it foreshadows the profound influence the cuff will have on Talon’s life.
   - Griffin, ever cautious, feels uneasy about the cuff but doesn’t voice his concerns. Sari is more curious about it, while Talon is initially indifferent, unaware of its significance.

2. **Early Encounters with Unknown Forces**:
   - The group begins to sense they are being hunted, but they don’t know by whom (later revealed to be **The Eidolons**). Each of them interprets the danger differently—Griffin wants to confront it, Sari remains cautious, and Talon feels the weight of leadership but is unsure of how to proceed.

3. **Growing Emotional Tension**:
   - Their genetic modifications subtly influence how they handle these early encounters. Griffin’s strength and protectiveness push him toward aggressive solutions, while Sari’s emotional intelligence helps her navigate the group’s dynamics. Talon’s cognitive enhancements make him more introspective, but his hesitation creates tension with Griffin.
   
4. **Foreshadowing the Veil’s Power**:
   - The wrist cuff begins to exert a subtle influence over Talon, leading to strange dreams and visions. These moments hint at the growing power of the Veil, but Talon’s reluctance to embrace this power creates conflict within the group.
