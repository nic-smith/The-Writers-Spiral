Chapter 1: The Hunt Begins

Talon felt the familiar weight of the Veil pressing against his mind, but this time, it was different—stronger, more insistent. The air around him grew thick, and his breath quickened as the world started to blur. The forest faded, replaced by shadows and indistinct shapes, swirling like smoke. He tried to resist, to pull back from the vision, but the Veil’s grip tightened, dragging him deeper into its grasp.

In this vision, he stood alone in a vast, empty field, the ground cracked and glowing faintly beneath him, pulsating with an eerie light. His friends were nowhere to be seen, and a deep sense of dread settled over him. He looked down at his hands, recoiling in horror—they were no longer his own. They were twisted and blackened, fingers long and claw-like, pulsating with the Veil’s dark energy. It felt as though a part of him was slipping away, and he shuddered at the thought.

Suddenly, he saw them—Sari, Griffin, and the rest of the group—emerging from the shadows, their faces pale and filled with terror. They didn’t recognize him. They stared at him with horror, backing away as if he were a monster. Panic surged in Talon’s chest as he tried to speak, to tell them it was still him, but no words came. Instead, the Veil spoke for him, a cold, alien voice echoing in his mind.

“Kill them.”

Talon’s vision-self moved forward against his will, his monstrous hands reaching out toward his friends. He fought with every ounce of his being to stop, to resist, but the Veil’s power surged through him, controlling his every movement. He could see the terror in their eyes, feel their fear as they scrambled to escape him, and it tore at his heart.

And then it happened. His hand lashed out, striking Griffin first. The force of the blow sent Griffin crashing to the ground, motionless. Talon screamed inside his own mind, but his body wouldn’t obey. He was a puppet, a vessel for the Veil’s will, and it was using him to destroy the people he cared about most. The despair felt like a weight on his chest, suffocating him.

Sari cried out, her voice filled with pain and betrayal. “Talon! No!”

The vision shattered. Talon gasped for air, his hands trembling violently. The forest around him snapped back into focus, and he stumbled, nearly collapsing from the shock of what he had just seen. He gripped the wrist cuff tightly, his knuckles white with the effort. The fear was suffocating, wrapping around him like a shroud.

The Veil whispered again, softer this time, as if mocking him. “Soon.”

He doubled over, trying to regain control of his breathing, but the fear lingered, gnawing at him. Was this his fate? Would the Veil eventually consume him, turning him into the very thing he feared? And worse—would it make him hurt the people he was trying to protect? He swore under his breath, vowing silently that he would never let it come to that. But doubt coiled in his gut like a serpent waiting to strike.

As the sun dipped lower, the forest grew darker, shadows thickening around them. The trees, once guardians, now felt like they were closing in, creating an oppressive atmosphere. Griffin led the way, his eyes darting nervously, scanning the underbrush for any sign of movement. Sari followed closely behind, her face pale and strained, reflecting the anxiety that gnawed at them all. Talon caught a glimpse of her, and his heart ached. She was always the strong one, but now her fear was palpable, and it made...

“Talon, we can’t keep running like this,” Griffin whispered harshly, glancing back. His voice was tight, laced with fear. “We need to find cover, something—anything—to hide us from those things.”

Talon nodded, throat dry, the words caught somewhere between his heart and tongue. The residual terror of the vision clung to him, but he pushed it aside. Now wasn’t the time for doubts or fear. They needed to survive. Yet, with each step, the weight of his vision pressed heavily on him, a relentless reminder of what could be.

They stumbled upon a cave hidden beneath the gnarled roots of an ancient tree, the entrance small and barely noticeable in the fading light. Griffin crouched down, motioning for them to follow. “In here,” he whispered, urgency in his voice. “It’s not perfect, but it’ll give us some cover.”

The three of them crawled inside, their movements slow and careful. The cave was cramped and cold, the air damp and musty. Talon leaned against the rough stone wall, struggling to steady his breathing, battling the lingering whispers of the Veil. Sari huddled next to him, her eyes wide with exhaustion and fear. Her hand found his, gripping it tightly as if drawing strength from him.

“Do you think they’ll find us?” she whispered, her voice trembling slightly, betraying her fear. Talon could feel her pulse racing against his skin, a stark reminder of their precarious situation.

Griffin shook his head, his jaw clenched. “Not if we stay quiet. Just... don’t move.”

The weight of silence settled over them, heavy and oppressive. Talon could hear the faint sounds of the forest outside—the rustle of leaves, the distant call of a bird, and the ever-present feeling of being watched. It felt as if the forest itself was holding its breath, waiting for the moment they would be discovered.

For several agonizing moments, they sat in silence, the tension rising like a palpable force in the air. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, every nerve in his body on high alert. Then, he heard it—a faint, metallic clicking sound, growing louder by the second.

His blood ran cold.

The Eidolons were near.

Griffin’s eyes widened as he heard the sound too. He gestured for them to press further back into the cave, their movements slow and deliberate. Talon held his breath, his muscles tense, ready to spring into action at a moment’s notice.

The clicking grew louder, followed by the unmistakable sound of mechanical limbs skittering across the forest floor. Talon’s pulse quickened. The Eidolons were close—too close.

Just outside the cave’s entrance, he saw it. The dark, spindly form of an Eidolon, its glowing red eyes scanning the area. It stopped for a moment, its head tilting as if it had caught the scent of something.

Talon felt Sari stiffen beside him, her breath catching in her throat. He reached out, placing a hand on her arm, silently willing her to stay still. They couldn’t afford to make a sound.

The Eidolon moved closer, its sharp limbs scraping against the rocks as it crept toward the entrance. Talon’s heart raced, his mind screaming at him to move, to do something, but he knew that any sudden movement would give them away.

The creature paused at the entrance, its head swiveling as it scanned the darkness inside. Talon’s muscles ached from holding his position, but he didn’t dare move. He could hear Griffin’s breathing, slow and controlled, as they waited, hoping the Eidolon wouldn’t find them.

After what felt like an eternity, the Eidolon finally turned away, its mechanical limbs clicking as it retreated into the forest. Talon let out a shaky breath, his body trembling from the adrenaline. They had been lucky—this time.

Griffin exhaled slowly, his voice barely above a whisper. “We can’t stay here long. They’ll be back.”

As they moved deeper into the cave, Talon felt the oppressive darkness pressing in around them. He leaned against the damp wall, trying to quiet his racing heart. The weight of the Veil was still there, lingering at the edges of his consciousness, waiting for another opportunity to take control.

“Are we safe here?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper, her grip tightening around Talon’s arm.

“For now,” Griffin replied, though Talon could see the uncertainty in his eyes. “But we need to keep moving. We can’t let them catch up to us.”

Sari nodded, but Talon could see the fear in her eyes. They were running on borrowed time, and he could feel the Veil's influence beginning to creep back in, whispering dark promises of power and control.

As they caught their breath, Talon’s mind began to race. He couldn’t shake the vision he had seen, the image of himself turning on his friends. He needed to find a way to control the Veil, to harness its power without losing himself to it.

Suddenly, a new thought struck him—what if he could turn the Veil’s power against the Eidolons? If he could understand it better, maybe he could wield it, rather than let it wield him. The idea sent a surge of determination through him.

“Guys,” he said, breaking the silence, “we can’t just run forever. What if I can learn to control the Veil? What if it could help us fight back?”

Griffin looked at him, skepticism clear in his expression. “You really think you can tame that thing? It nearly made you kill me.”

Talon felt

 the sting of his words but pressed on. “I’m not saying it’ll be easy, but if we work together... ”
