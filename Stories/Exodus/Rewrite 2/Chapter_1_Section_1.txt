## Chapter 1: The Hunt Begins

### Section 1: The Chase

The air was thick with mist, cold and damp, clinging to their skin like a second layer of sweat. Talon led the way, his feet pounding the wet ground, each step echoing through the oppressive silence of the forest. The trees loomed tall, their branches twisted and gnarled, like skeletal fingers stretching toward the group, closing in around them. The scent of wet earth and decay filled their lungs with every breath. Shadows moved at the edges of their vision, flickering like whispers, too fast to be seen—...

“Why do we keep running?” Griffin’s voice cut through the air like a blade, sharp and full of impatience. His breath came in ragged bursts, the frustration of the chase gnawing at him more than the physical exertion. “We should fight them, face them head-on.” He clenched his fists, every muscle in his body coiled tight, ready to explode. The tension in his voice simmered, like a fire waiting to ignite.

“Not yet,” Talon barked back, barely looking over his shoulder. His voice was tight, betraying the calm façade he wore. He knew Griffin was right, at least partially. The hunters were getting closer, their presence a constant, gnawing threat. But using the Veil—tapping into that power—would cost him more than he could afford. It had already taken too much.

Sari stumbled, her breath coming in short, desperate gasps as her eyes darted between the trees. Her heart pounded against her ribs, each beat a frantic reminder of how close their enemies were. Her hands trembled, not from exhaustion, but from the weight of fear pressing down on her. She didn’t want to fight—she didn’t want to run anymore, either. The forest, dark and twisted, felt alive, as if it watched them, herding them deeper into its depths. It whispered her name, or perhaps it was just her mind p...

“We can’t stop,” Sari whispered, more to herself than to anyone else. She wasn’t sure she could convince Griffin, not when he looked like he was ready to tear down a tree with his bare hands. But Talon’s voice was the only anchor she had, even as he led them deeper into the unknown.

Griffin growled under his breath, his frustration boiling over. His hand twitched, eager to reach for his weapon. “I’m not afraid of whatever’s out there. I’m tired of running.”

Talon’s jaw tightened. He could feel it too—the Veil, pulsing through the wrist cuff like a silent drumbeat. It tugged at him, whispering promises of power, but every time he used it, something was lost. His memories. His sense of self. It was a trade he wasn’t ready to make yet.

The ground beneath them shifted, soft and treacherous, as if the forest itself was moving. Talon glanced around, his senses heightened, not just by instinct but by the flickers of alien memories flashing behind his eyes. The Veil had shown him things—things he didn’t understand. Memories of battles fought long ago, of towering machines and endless war. They didn’t belong to him, but they haunted him all the same.

A sharp sound pierced the silence—a mechanical scream, echoing through the trees, sending a fresh wave of fear through the group. The hunters were closing in, faster now. Talon’s hand hovered near the wrist cuff, his pulse quickening. He knew they couldn’t outrun them forever.

Sari stumbled again, her foot catching on a root. She steadied herself against a tree, dry heaving from the stress and fear that twisted her stomach into knots. She didn’t dare look behind her—didn’t need to. The threat was all around them, closing in like a predator stalking its prey.

Griffin was beside her in an instant, grabbing her arm, his grip tight but not cruel. “Get up,” he snapped, his voice low and urgent. “We don’t have time for this.”

“I can’t—” Sari choked on the words, but Griffin pulled her up before she could protest. There was no room for weakness here, no room for hesitation. The forest wouldn’t allow it. 

Talon felt the Veil pulse again, stronger this time, urging him to act. He knew what was coming next—the decision he dreaded. If he didn’t use it, they’d be overwhelmed, taken down by the hunters that stalked them. But if he did, what part of him would he lose this time?

The trees closed in tighter, the mist thickening, the shadows growing darker. Every step forward felt like walking deeper into a nightmare. The air was colder now, biting at their skin, each breath a battle against the suffocating dread that filled the space around them.

Griffin growled again, his frustration mounting. “We need to fight.”

Talon’s fingers brushed the wrist cuff, his mind torn between survival and the price he would pay. He knew the moment was coming, the choice inevitable.

Another mechanical scream echoed through the trees, louder, closer. The shadows shifted, moving toward them, taking shape in the dim light. Talon’s heart raced, his decision made for him. The Veil pulsed once more, a final warning.

“We have to move,” Talon said, his voice steady, but inside, the fear gnawed at him like a hungry beast. He knew what was coming next.

He just didn’t know if he’d survive it.
