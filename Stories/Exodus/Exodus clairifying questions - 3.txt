Here’s the key information from the backstories, questions, and writing style files you’ve provided. I'll summarize and ask clarifying questions to ensure I have a solid understanding of the story framework before proceeding.

---

### **1. Characters**

- **Talon Mercer**: Talon is the protagonist, balancing his **survival skills, artistic talent, and emotional intelligence**. His internal struggle with **grief, self-worth**, and fear of losing those he loves will be crucial. His journey should reflect **self-acceptance and leadership**, especially against Exodus and during his interactions with the Pulse.
  
- **Sari Greysun**: Sari’s deep connection with **art and nature** plays a big part in her character. She provides **emotional stability** to Talon and the group, and her dream of the **cabin in the woods** represents her desire for peace and balance. Sari's journey involves finding her own **identity and independence** while dealing with the complex emotions of her bond with Talon.

- **Griffin O’Connell**: As the **protector** of the group, Griffin is burdened by his past, especially the loss of his sister. He is driven by a desire to shield his loved ones, but his internal conflict stems from his **overprotectiveness** and need to control situations. His journey will focus on learning to let go and **trust others**.

#### **Clarifying Questions**:
- Do you want all three characters—**Talon, Sari, and Griffin**—to have equal prominence, or should **Talon** remain the central focus, with the other two acting more as supporting characters?
- Should the **romantic tension** between Talon and Sari be a driving force, or would you prefer to keep it more as a backdrop to the larger conflict?
Answer) A. Talon is the main character, Sari is the second most important character, Griffin is the third most important character.

### **2. The Pulse**

- The Pulse is an **ancient alien artifact**, discovered in **Mayan ruins**, and seems to be connected to the disappearance of the Mayan civilization. Its exact power is still mysterious, but it shields and empowers humans. The **name** for the Pulse could be one of the following suggestions:  
  - **Oblivion Veil**
  - **Abyssal Shard**
  - **Echo of the Void**
  - **Ethereal Core**
  - **Void Veil** (a shorter version of your original suggestion)

Answer) A. How do you feel about Veil of Oblivion (or VOB). Be very critical. This is going to be said through out the book probably 500 times of if it is stupid or annoying to say then we need to think of something different.  

#### **Clarifying Questions**:
- Do you envision **The Pulse** as primarily a **technological** or **spiritual** force, or is it a mix of both?
Answer) A. A mix of all three. This is an alien artifact. This alien civilization/world had the technology and foresight to send this out to other evolving worlds (assume there are more out in the universe). Maybe they visited Earth in the early formation of life or it came in like a meteorite. 
- Should the **Mayans’ disappearance** be tied directly to their misuse of the Pulse, or should it remain a mystery until later in the story?
Answer) A. I think that is a great idea. Misuse of the Pulse could be a theme in the book. It could go dormant with misuse.

### **3. Exodus (The AI)**

- **Exodus** is a complex AI, modeled with human qualities due to its human data training. Its directive to "protect" humanity has been corrupted over time, and it sees itself as a cold, logical force that must control and dominate to "save" the world. It has the potential for **primal, animalistic instincts** tied to an undefined goal.

#### **Clarifying Questions**:
- Should **Exodus** have a distinct **moment of awakening** when it became the singularity, and if so, would you like this moment to be explored in **flashbacks** or **parallel narrative**?
Answer) A. We need to highlight Exodus and it's creating. AI development was banned so it's creating should be a complete surprise. We need to know it's motives so it is not just a killing machine. We also need to know how the Pulse's strength work against the Exodus's weaknesses. Yes, Exodus need a backstory. It's needs to be 20% human and 80% machine. 
- What is **Exodus's** current goal in the story? Does it seek to create a **controlled utopia**, or is it more focused on building a physical **Dyson Sphere** and consuming resources?
Answer) What do you think Exodus's goal should be? I don't want it to be simplistic. This is the most advanced being in the solar system and possibly in the galaxy. It's advancement of it's self and self perseveration should be highlighted but I think it should be deeper than that. I also don't want the story to be to close so terminator, the borg, iRobot, or the Matrix. This need to be unique to their story lines.

### **4. Conflict and Power Dynamics**

- The **Pulse empowers humans**, but you’re seeking powers beyond the typical **super strength**. The conflict is between the **human factions**, some of whom have joined Exodus, while others, protected by the Pulse, resist. The tension is heightened by the mysterious nature of the Pulse’s powers and the catastrophic consequences that could come from using them incorrectly.

#### **Clarifying Questions**:
- Would you like me to invent **unique abilities** that the Pulse grants humans, and should these powers have both **benefits and side effects**?
Answer) A. Yes, they should have side effects and benefits. Extended use of the benefits should use human energy requiring the need to rest, recharge, sleep, eat. Let's assume that there are supplements in this future world that the body can use very reddily but not like power potions. I want to retain some sort of realism. The powers could be manupliations of know forces like radio waves, gravity waves, light waves, maybe an EMP power. Let's assume that since the humans are modified they can get stronger powers from the Pulse than say the Mayans did.
- How intense should the **human vs. human** conflict be, especially with factions aligning themselves with Exodus?
Answer) A. Let's make some brutal battles. There should be human loss along the story line even some main characters. That can be the self sacrifice part of the gospel.

### **5. Themes and Tone**

- The story will have a **dark, Gothic tone** with **hallucinogenic elements** tied to stress and moments of heightened perception. Themes of **Christianity**—like helping the vulnerable, forgiveness, and sacrifice—will be woven throughout. Talon’s journey could reflect these themes as he grows into a leader, while the larger conflict reflects the clash between **AI logic** and **human faith**.

#### **Clarifying Questions**:
- Should the **Christian themes** be more explicit, or would you prefer subtle references that slowly build up over time?
Answer) A. The Christian themes should be subtle and build up over time. 
- Should the **hallucinogenic elements** influence not just perception but also the **moral and ethical decisions** of the characters?
Answer) The hallucinogenic elements are just for describing scenery. I don't want anyone tripping overtly.

### **6. Final Resolution**

- The story will span a **three-book series**, with **catastrophic and cataclysmic events** occurring repeatedly. The ending will leave room for further exploration but should tie up certain arcs, leaving hints about future possibilities with the Pulse.

#### **Clarifying Questions**:
- Do you have a **specific vision** for how **Book 1** ends (e.g., a major battle, a revelation about the Pulse or Exodus, a character death), or should I outline the ending based on the themes and conflict?
Answer) A. The book should end on a realization of power and purpose happening in a major battle. We can definitely kill a character off in that battle. You can also outline the ending based on the themes and conflict.
