Here are a few clarifying questions that could help ensure we have a comprehensive understanding before starting to write *Exodus*:

### Story Structure and Pacing
1. **Pacing**: How do you envision the pacing of *Exodus*? Should it have a balance of fast-paced action scenes interspersed with slower, more reflective moments, or do you want a different approach?
Answer) A. There should be some frantic scenes where the reader can't catch their breath.
	B. There should be slow scenes that draw the reader in with mystery.
	C. There should be scenes that build character relationship through dialog, reflective flash backs, and interpersonal dialog. 
	D. The make up of the story should be 
		i. 35%-50% action depending on the situation
		ii. 20%-40% dialog depending on the situation
		iii. 20%-30% descriptive scenery depending on the situation
		iiii. Most information should be earned by the reader or given in description. Little should be explicitly given to the reader unless absolutely necessary.

### Character Development
2. **Character Arcs**: Beyond Talon, Sari, and Griffin, are there specific arcs you want to develop for supporting characters? Should any have transformative journeys that intersect with the main plot?
Answer) A. Yes, these characters must evolve. It is paramount that they evolve to unlock the power of the Veil. The Veil only gives power to those who are worthy and of great character. If misused the Veil can and will kill.

### Thematic Depth
3. **Themes**: Are there other themes you want to explore alongside those already mentioned, such as the ethics of technology, the nature of sacrifice, or the consequences of power?
Answer) A. I think you can tell me when reflecting on each chapter if we can make it better by adding characters or events to character and world build.

### World-Building
4. **Setting Details**: What kind of environments do you envision for the story? Are there specific locations or settings (e.g., urban, rural, dystopian) that will be crucial to the plot or character development?
Answer) A. This should be a dystopian world. The setting will change between rural, urban, woodsie, or space as Exodus progress though the world.
	B. In the beginning there will be war with Exodus but people wont know why because AI development was supposed be banned in favor for genetic manupliation. Toward the middle we will come to understand why the world is under attack and understand the Veil's part in the war. At the end of the book there will be a big war.

### Conflict Resolution
5. **Resolution Details**: Beyond the major battle in Book 1, how do you want the story's conflicts to evolve in subsequent books? Should there be a clear trajectory for each characterâ€™s development across the series?
Answer) A. As the books progress our main characters will become almost iconic but at first they will be completely unknow. 

### Event Structure
6. **Event Types**: Would you like specific types of events to recur throughout the story (e.g., natural disasters, attacks from Exodus, internal human conflicts), and how frequently should these events occur?
Answer) A. I want to pepper the book with tons of events, let's say 50-80 events (maybe more if needed). 
	B. The events should be more or less random. Some events will fit the story line closely and some will be completely random. Here is the break down.
             i. For every event 75% should fit the story line and 25% should be completely random (think meteorite or hurricane)
	C. The events should be categorized as micro, minor, major, catastrophic, and cataclysmic.
            ii. Event's should be in this percentage range.
                a. micro - 40% 
                b. minor - 26% 
                c. major - 16%
                d. catastrophic - 10%
                e. cataclysmic - 3%
