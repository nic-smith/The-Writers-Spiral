If you do not have the Comp Story Review Questions in memory, stop and ask for me to upload the questions.

Output the current section and ask if it is the right Chapter and section. Wait for a reply. 

Rewrite Section. **Do not output the text at this step.**

Next, review the revised section using the Comprehensive Story Review Questions, providing feedback and a rating on a scale of 1 to 20. **Only output the primary weakness identified and the overall rating at this step.**

If the rating is below 19/20, rewrite the section based on the feedback to address the primary weakness. **Do not output the text at this step.**

Continue this iterative process until the rating is at least 19/20.
Output the chapter section into a text document titled the Chapter Number - Section number.
