**Chapter 3: Deeper into the Unknown**

**The Strange Encounter**

The forest grew darker, the shadows thicker, as if the sun had been swallowed whole. The world around them felt suffocating, the air heavy with the oppressive weight of unseen eyes. Talon’s steps felt slower, the pull of the Veil stronger with each passing minute. The others were tense, their movements deliberate but uncertain, as if the ground itself might betray them at any moment.

They pressed on, though none of them spoke. The silence between them had grown, stretched taut by the strain of the day. Talon could feel the distance, not just physically, but emotionally. Griffin’s patience had worn thin, and Sari’s concern was ever-present but now tinged with her own uncertainty. Talon wanted to say something, anything, but he couldn’t find the words. The weight of the cuff and the constant hum in his mind left him drained, as though the Veil itself was drawing strength from him.

Then, suddenly, there was movement ahead.

Talon froze, his breath catching in his throat as a shadow flickered between the trees. It wasn’t like the distortions they had seen before—this was different. More solid. More deliberate. The figure moved with purpose, slipping in and out of the dense forest like a predator stalking its prey.

"Did you see that?" Sari whispered, her voice barely audible.

Griffin nodded, his hand tightening on his knife. "I saw it. Stay close."

The figure moved again, closer this time, and Talon could make out more details—tattered clothing, a gaunt frame, and eyes that seemed to glow faintly in the dim light. It wasn’t one of the Eidolons, that much was clear. But whatever it was, it wasn’t entirely **human** either. The way it moved, the way it seemed to blend with the shadows, made it feel like something more—a **manifestation**, perhaps, or something tied to the Veil itself.

Griffin stepped forward, his knife at the ready. "Who’s there?"

For a moment, there was no response. The forest seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for something. Then, slowly, the figure stepped out from the trees, standing just at the edge of the clearing. It was a man, or at least it appeared to be. His clothes were worn, ragged, and covered in dirt, his skin pale and stretched thin over sharp bones. But his eyes—those glowing, unnatural eyes—were fixed on Talon, and they seemed to **see straight through him**.

"Not much time," the man rasped, his voice cracked and hoarse, like he hadn’t spoken in years. "It’s almost here."

Talon exchanged a quick glance with Sari and Griffin, but neither of them moved. The figure’s gaze didn’t waver. It was locked on Talon, as though he was the only one who mattered.

"What’s almost here?" Talon asked, his voice tense.

The man’s lips twitched into something resembling a smile, but it wasn’t a comforting sight. "You already know. You’ve seen it."

Talon’s heart raced, his mind immediately flashing back to the visions—the **alien city**, the towering machines, the gaunt figures that wandered through the ruins. He swallowed hard, his hand instinctively reaching for the cuff, though he didn’t know why. The **Veil’s whispers** were louder now, almost drowning out the man’s words.

"Who are you?" Griffin demanded, stepping in front of Talon slightly, his knife raised defensively. "And what do you know about this place?"

The man’s glowing eyes shifted to Griffin for a brief moment, but it was clear he had little interest in anyone but Talon. "I’ve been here longer than you can imagine," he said quietly. "I’ve seen what’s coming. What’s always been coming. The Veil… it’s hungry."

Talon’s pulse quickened. "What do you mean? The Veil is… alive?"

The man nodded slowly, his smile widening, though it was far from comforting. "Alive. And dying. It’s both, and neither. It wants you, Talon. It wants all of you. But you—you’re the key."

Griffin scoffed, though there was a nervous edge to it. "He’s just trying to scare us. We need to keep moving."

But Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that the man was telling the truth—or at least part of it. The Veil’s presence had been growing stronger, more insistent, with every step they took. And the way the man spoke, the way his eyes seemed to **burn with knowledge**… there was something about him that felt real. Terrifying, but real.

Sari stepped forward, her voice softer, but edged with suspicion. "If the Veil wants him, why are you here? Why are you warning us?"

The man’s smile faltered, his glowing eyes flickering with something close to pain. "Because I wasn’t the first. I’ve seen what happens to those it touches. It’s not kindness that drives it. It’s survival."

Talon felt a chill crawl down his spine. He had always suspected that the Veil’s power wasn’t entirely benevolent, but hearing it put into words, hearing that it had consumed others before him, made it all too real.

"Then why me?" Talon asked, his voice quiet, almost afraid to hear the answer.

The man’s gaze locked on him again, his eyes narrowing. "Because you’re already halfway there. You’ve felt it, haven’t you? The pull. The whispers. The power. It’s not letting you go. It never will."

Talon’s breath caught in his throat. The man’s words rang true in a way that unsettled him deeply. The **Veil’s influence** had been growing stronger, more insistent, and every time he used the cuff, it felt like it was pulling him deeper into something he didn’t fully understand—something he couldn’t control.

"What do you want us to do?" Sari asked, her voice calm but steady.

The man’s eyes flicked to her briefly, but then returned to Talon. "You can’t outrun it. You can’t fight it. The only thing you can do… is survive it. And hope that when it’s done with you, there’s something left."

Griffin took a step forward, his frustration finally boiling over. "That’s enough. We don’t have time for this. Whatever game you’re playing, we’re not interested."

The man’s smile vanished, his expression hardening. "It’s not a game. It’s survival. You’re in its world now, whether you realize it or not. The Veil… it doesn’t just touch things. It **devours** them."

Without another word, the man turned and slipped back into the shadows of the trees, disappearing as suddenly as he had appeared.

The silence that followed was deafening, and for a moment, none of them moved.

"We need to go," Griffin said, his voice tight with barely concealed anger. "Before he comes back."

Talon nodded slowly, but his mind was still racing with the man’s words. The Veil was alive. It was hungry. And it wanted him.

As they continued deeper into the forest, the shadows seemed to press in closer, the weight of the **Veil’s presence** heavier than ever.
