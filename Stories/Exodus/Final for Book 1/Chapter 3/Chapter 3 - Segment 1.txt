**Chapter 3: Deeper into the Unknown**

**Reality Distortions**

The forest around them seemed to thicken as they moved deeper into the unknown. Every step felt heavier, like the air itself was pressing down on them. The towering trees stretched endlessly upward, their branches intertwining in a chaotic web that blocked out the fading daylight. Talon wiped the sweat from his brow, though the coolness of the forest should have kept him comfortable. It wasn’t the heat—it was the **cuff**.

The soft hum that had been barely noticeable before was louder now, almost like a faint vibration running through his bones. He glanced down at the cuff on his wrist, half-expecting to see it glowing again, but it remained dull, lifeless. Still, the pressure it exerted on him was unmistakable, growing stronger with each passing hour.

Sari was just ahead of him, her pace slower now as the ground became more uneven. She didn’t speak, but Talon could tell from the way she kept glancing over her shoulder that she sensed it too—the strangeness in the air. Griffin moved ahead of them, his hand never far from the hilt of his knife, his eyes scanning the dense underbrush with the intensity of a predator on edge.

The world felt wrong here. It wasn’t anything Talon could pinpoint at first. It was a sense, something just out of reach, like the world was subtly bending around them. The trees seemed to sway in time with the pulse in his wrist, their shadows stretching unnaturally long as the sun dipped lower on the horizon.

"Does anyone else feel that?" Talon’s voice cracked through the quiet, startling even himself. He didn’t mean to speak, but the growing unease inside him demanded release.

Sari paused, her eyes meeting his. "Feel what?"

Talon shook his head, struggling to put the sensation into words. "It’s like… the air. It’s heavier. And the shadows—they’re… moving."

Griffin glanced back, his expression unreadable but alert. "You’re just tired, Talon. We’ve been pushing hard all day."

But Talon knew it wasn’t just fatigue. The forest was **shifting**, subtly at first, but the more he focused, the more obvious it became. Shadows that should have stayed still were creeping along the ground, stretching and twisting in ways that defied reason. The trees seemed to **lean inward**, their branches twisting as though watching their every move.

Sari’s brow furrowed, her gaze sweeping the forest. "No," she murmured, almost to herself. "He’s right. Something’s… off."

Griffin tensed, his jaw tightening as he scanned the treeline. "It’s probably just Metis’s tech. They’ve got sensors, drones—things we can’t see. They’re messing with our heads, trying to throw us off."

But Talon wasn’t convinced. The cuff on his wrist pulsed again, and the shadows flickered, almost in response. The sensation was growing stronger, like the forest was warping, bending under the influence of something far older, far more powerful than Metis. **The Veil** was here, close, its presence pushing against reality.

The deeper they went, the more the world seemed to twist. The ground felt unstable beneath Talon’s boots, as though it might give way at any moment, and the trees creaked softly, their branches whispering words he couldn’t quite make out.

A soft rustle in the distance caught his attention, and Talon’s breath hitched. It wasn’t the sound of an animal. It was more deliberate, as if something—or someone—was **watching them**. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and he instinctively touched the cuff, feeling the cold metal beneath his fingertips. The power inside it stirred, but Talon resisted the urge to use it. He didn’t want to know what might happen if he did.

"Griffin…" Talon began, his voice barely more than a whisper.

Griffin was already ahead of him, his eyes narrowed as he scanned the trees. "I hear it."

Sari moved closer to Talon, her hand hovering near her sidearm. "What do you think it is?"

Talon shook his head. "I don’t know. But it’s close."

The rustling grew louder, more distinct. It wasn’t just the wind. There was something moving through the trees, just beyond their line of sight. A shadow flickered in the distance—too quick to catch, but there, unmistakably. Talon’s heart raced, his pulse pounding in his ears. He could feel the **Veil’s presence**, pressing against him, distorting the world around them.

And then, just as quickly as it started, the rustling stopped.

The forest fell silent, unnaturally so. No wind. No animals. Just the three of them, standing in a landscape that felt like it had been **stretched out of shape**. The shadows were longer now, darker, curling along the ground like living things, and the air seemed thick, suffocating.

"We need to move," Griffin said, his voice low and urgent. "Whatever that is, I don’t want to wait around to find out."

Talon nodded, though his legs felt heavy, weighed down by the oppressive energy in the air. The cuff hummed softly, a constant reminder that it was there, waiting, its power coiled and ready to be unleashed. But Talon wasn’t sure if the Veil was trying to help them—or **consume them**.

As they continued forward, the world around them grew more distorted. The trees no longer seemed solid, their forms flickering as though they were caught between two realities. Talon’s vision wavered, the edges of his sight blurring as the forest shifted again, a faint echo of something else—another place, another time—flashing in his mind.

His breath quickened. The **Veil** was pressing closer now. He could feel it, tugging at his consciousness, urging him to let go, to slip between the cracks of reality.

"Talon, stay with me," Sari said, her voice tight with worry.

Talon blinked, forcing himself to focus, to stay grounded in the present. The forest was real. The ground beneath his feet was real. But the Veil’s influence was creeping in, and with it came the promise of something far more dangerous.

They pressed on, deeper into the twisted woods, knowing that whatever was waiting for them ahead, it was far worse than the shadows they left behind.
