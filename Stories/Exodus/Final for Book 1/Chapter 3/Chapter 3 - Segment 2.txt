**Chapter 3: Deeper into the Unknown**

**The Group’s Strain**

As they ventured deeper into the forest, the oppressive stillness hung over them like a dark cloud. The soft rustle of leaves underfoot was the only sound, and even that seemed swallowed by the thick air. Talon’s pulse thrummed in time with the cuff, his mind racing with thoughts he couldn’t quiet. The distortions in the forest—those flickering shadows and shifting trees—had only grown worse, and each step felt like it was taking them closer to something **twisted**, something **wrong**.

Griffin was the first to break the silence. His voice was tight, laced with frustration. "We’re not getting anywhere like this. We’re wasting time."

Talon felt the tension radiating off him, though Griffin didn’t turn around to address him directly. It had been growing steadily, ever since the last encounter with the Eidolons. Griffin had always been the type to keep pushing forward, but now there was something else—something more personal behind his words. Talon could sense it like a thorn under his skin, but he wasn’t sure how to pull it out.

"We don’t have much choice," Sari replied softly, her voice calm but firm. "We can’t rush in blind. You know what happens if we do."

Griffin stopped abruptly, turning to face her, his brow furrowed in irritation. "What happens? We get killed, that’s what happens. We’re walking straight into whatever Metis is setting up for us, and you’re telling me we need to slow down? This place isn’t right, Sari. We’ve been in bad places before, but this—this is different."

Sari stood her ground, though Talon could see the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes. "It’s different, yes. But rushing isn’t going to help us figure it out."

Talon felt the weight of their words pressing on him. He knew what Griffin meant. The forest was wrong. It was more than just being lost—there was a distortion here, a warping of reality that made every step feel like they were walking deeper into a **trap**. But it wasn’t just Metis. It was the Veil, and whatever was lurking in its depths, waiting for him.

Griffin’s gaze flicked to Talon, sharp and accusing. "And what about you? What do you think this is, Talon? Some kind of **Veil trickery**? Or are you just waiting for another one of your ‘visions’ to tell us what’s next?"

The words stung, and Talon felt a surge of defensiveness rise up in his chest. He hadn’t asked for any of this. The visions, the cuff—it had all been thrust upon him, and now it seemed like Griffin was holding him responsible for things he couldn’t even begin to control.

"I’m trying to figure it out, just like you," Talon snapped, unable to keep the edge out of his voice. "But it’s not something I can just turn on and off. The Veil—it’s not a tool. It doesn’t work like that."

Griffin’s eyes narrowed, his frustration boiling over. "Then what good is it? You’ve had that thing for weeks now, and all it’s done is get us into more danger. If you can’t control it, Talon, then it’s a liability."

Talon opened his mouth to respond, but the words caught in his throat. He wanted to argue, to defend himself, but the truth was, Griffin was right. He hadn’t been able to control the cuff, and every time he tried to use its power, it left him more confused, more tangled in the Veil’s whispers.

Sari stepped in before the argument could escalate. "Griffin, that’s not fair," she said, her voice firm but gentle. "Talon’s doing the best he can. We all are. This place—it’s messing with all of us."

Griffin didn’t respond immediately, his jaw clenched tightly as he glared at Talon. The tension hung heavy between them, a rift that had been widening ever since the cuff had started to show its true power. Talon could see the doubt in Griffin’s eyes, the suspicion that Talon was more of a danger than a help. And it wasn’t just the cuff—it was the visions, the moments when Talon drifted away into some **other world**. Griffin didn’t trust him, and Talon wasn’t sure he could blame him.

"We’re wasting time," Griffin muttered finally, turning away and moving forward again. "Let’s just keep moving before this place gets any worse."

Talon exhaled slowly, the tension in his chest loosening slightly. Sari gave him a reassuring glance, but her eyes were filled with concern. Talon appreciated the gesture, but he knew that even Sari was beginning to wonder if he could keep this up. The weight of the cuff felt heavier with every step they took.

As they continued deeper into the forest, the distortions became more frequent. The shadows seemed to shift and twist in ways that made no sense, stretching across the ground and then snapping back as though they were alive. The trees bent unnaturally, their branches contorted into impossible shapes. At one point, Talon was certain he saw one of the trees **shift locations**, standing in one spot one moment and then ten feet to the left the next.

The further they went, the more intense the warping of reality became. The air grew colder, and Talon felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, a creeping sense of dread filling him as the world around him continued to twist. The Veil was pressing closer, its presence warping reality like a ripple in a still pond. And with it came the whispers.

Let go, Talon.

He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to drown out the voice, but it was relentless, gnawing at the edges of his mind.

Let us show you the truth.

He stumbled slightly, his vision swimming as the world tilted, and for a brief moment, the forest was gone. In its place stood the **alien city**, the towering structures jagged and broken, with strange symbols glowing faintly in the distance. The air was thick with ash, swirling in the wind, and the faint shadows of the gaunt figures he had seen in his visions flickered on the horizon.

But just as quickly as it came, the vision faded, and Talon was back in the forest, his legs trembling from the sudden shift.

"Talon?" Sari’s voice was soft, but it cut through the fog in his mind.

He looked at her, blinking away the remnants of the vision. "I’m fine," he muttered, though his voice lacked conviction.

Sari studied him for a moment, her brow furrowed in concern, but she didn’t push. She knew him well enough by now to know when he needed space, and Talon was grateful for that.

They pressed on, but the tension between them was palpable, the weight of unspoken fears and doubts hanging over them like a shroud. The Veil’s influence was growing stronger, and with it, the cracks in their group were beginning to show.
