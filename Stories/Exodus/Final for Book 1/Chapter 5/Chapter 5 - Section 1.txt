**Chapter 5: Trust Frayed**

**Griffin’s Confrontation**

The air between them crackled with tension, thicker than the forest mist that clung to their skin. The sun was barely rising, casting faint golden light through the trees, but the warmth did nothing to ease the cold silence that had fallen over the group. Talon sat by the fire, the cuff on his wrist feeling heavier than ever, its presence a constant, oppressive reminder of the power he couldn’t control. 

Griffin’s eyes burned with frustration as he paced back and forth, his movements sharp and angry. He had been stewing all night, his patience worn thin by their endless run from Metis and Talon’s repeated failures to control the Veil’s power. 

Finally, Griffin stopped pacing and turned to face Talon, his voice low and edged with barely restrained fury. “We can’t keep doing this.”

Talon looked up, meeting Griffin’s gaze, but said nothing. He knew what was coming.

Griffin’s hands clenched into fists at his sides. “Every time you try to use that thing,” he spat, his eyes darting to the cuff, “you make things worse. You can’t control it, Talon. You never could.”

Talon’s jaw tightened, his chest tightening with a mix of shame and frustration. “I’m doing the best I can,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. 

“Your best isn’t good enough,” Griffin shot back, taking a step closer. “You’re a liability, Talon. Every time you try to use that power, it gets us into more trouble. How many more times are we going to have to run because you can’t control yourself?”

Talon rose to his feet, his heart pounding. He wanted to argue, to defend himself, but he couldn’t deny the truth in Griffin’s words. The visions, the power surges—it all felt beyond his control, slipping further from his grasp with every attempt.

Sari stepped forward, her voice calm but pleading. “Griffin, stop. This isn’t helping.”

Griffin barely glanced at her, his focus locked on Talon. “He’s going to get us killed, Sari! You know it. I know it. And he knows it.”

Talon’s chest heaved with frustration. “I didn’t ask for this! Do you think I want to be the one with the cuff? Do you think I enjoy losing control every time I try to protect us?”

Griffin’s eyes narrowed, his voice dropping to a dangerous low. “Then maybe you should stop trying.”

The words hung in the air, sharp as a blade. Sari’s eyes flicked between them, her hands outstretched, trying to ease the tension, but it was too late. The confrontation had been building for days, weeks even, and now there was no stopping it.

Talon took a step toward Griffin, his own frustration boiling over. “You think you could do better? You think this is easy?”

Griffin didn’t back down. “I think I wouldn’t put us all in danger by playing with something I can’t control.”

“Enough!” Sari stepped between them, her voice rising. “Both of you, stop! This isn’t the time for this.”

But her words did little to defuse the situation. Griffin’s anger was too hot, and Talon’s shame and frustration were too raw. Talon could feel the Veil’s presence in the back of his mind, its whispers growing louder, feeding off the conflict, urging him to give in, to let go.

Griffin’s fists clenched tighter, his face inches from Talon’s now. “If you can’t get a handle on that thing, we’re done for. So figure it out, or I’m done with this. With all of it.”

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him, its power thrumming just beneath the surface. He wanted to shout back, to tell Griffin he didn’t understand, but the words stuck in his throat. He was losing control, not just of the Veil, but of everything—his grip on reality, his place in the group, his own mind.

Sari’s voice trembled as she tried again, her hands gently pushing them apart. “We need to stick together. This is what Metis wants. We can’t tear each other apart.”

But Talon could see it in Griffin’s eyes—the doubt, the anger, the mistrust. And for the first time, Talon wondered if Griffin was right. Maybe he couldn’t control the Veil. Maybe he never could.

The confrontation hung in the air, unresolved, the tension thick and palpable. Sari’s attempt to mediate had failed, and the rift between Talon and Griffin had only widened.

As they stood there, the sun rising slowly through the trees, Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted—something that couldn’t be undone.
