**Chapter 5: Trust Frayed**

**Talon’s Hallucinations**

The argument with Griffin left a bitter taste in Talon’s mouth as they moved deeper into the woods. The silence between them was suffocating, the tension palpable with every step. Sari had fallen back slightly, walking alongside Talon, her expression tight with concern, but she didn’t say anything. There was nothing to say. 

Talon could still feel the weight of Griffin’s accusations pressing down on him, sinking into his bones. Every word, every sharp glance, had cut deep. And worst of all, Talon couldn’t deny it. He was losing control, and the Veil was becoming harder to resist with every passing day. The whispers in his mind had grown louder since the confrontation, and now they were a constant hum, creeping into the edges of his thoughts, distorting his sense of reality.

The world around him felt wrong. Too quiet, too still. The trees seemed to lean in, their shadows stretching unnaturally long as the sun dipped lower on the horizon. Talon’s hand drifted to the cuff on his wrist, fingers tracing the cold metal as he tried to steady his breath. The power inside it pulsed faintly, responding to his touch, and with it came the faintest flicker of a voice—low, insidious.

**Let go.**

He clenched his jaw, trying to push the voice away, but it was relentless. It tugged at the edges of his consciousness, pulling him deeper into its web. His vision blurred for a moment, and he stumbled slightly, catching himself against a nearby tree.

“Talon?” Sari’s voice was soft, but filled with concern. She reached out, her hand resting lightly on his arm. “Are you okay?”

Talon nodded quickly, not trusting his voice. He couldn’t let her see how far he was slipping. Not now. Not after everything.

But as they walked, the world around him continued to warp, the lines between reality and the Veil blurring in ways that made his stomach twist. The forest shifted in his peripheral vision—trees bending and swaying unnaturally, the sky flickering between shades of gray and red. The air felt thick, heavy with something unseen, something old and hungry.

And then the whispers began in earnest.

**You’ve seen it before, haven’t you? The truth beneath the surface. The alien world. It’s real. It’s waiting.**

Talon’s breath hitched, his heart racing as the world around him began to dissolve, replaced by fleeting glimpses of the alien world—the towering structures, jagged and broken, standing against a blood-red sky. The symbols carved into the walls glowed faintly, pulsing with a rhythm that matched the beat of his heart. He could hear the faint wails of something distant, something lost.

He blinked hard, trying to shake the vision, but it clung to him, wrapping around his mind like a vice.

The Veil wasn’t just a tool. It was alive. A living, breathing force that stretched across time and space, pulling everything into its grasp. And Talon was caught in the middle of it, tangled in its web.

“Not real,” he muttered under his breath, trying to ground himself. “It’s not real.”

But the whispers continued, relentless and cruel.

**It’s all real, Talon. The alien world. The power. You’re part of it now. There’s no going back.**

Talon stumbled again, his vision swimming as the ground beneath his feet seemed to ripple like water. The forest twisted, the trees stretching impossibly high, their branches curling inward like claws. The sky flickered once more, turning a deep crimson, the alien city superimposed over the forest like a fractured mirror.

He could hear the voices of the alien race now—faint, but growing louder. They were calling out to him, their words unintelligible but filled with an overwhelming sense of despair. He could feel their pain, their fear. And it was suffocating.

“Talon!” Sari’s voice cut through the fog, sharp and urgent. Her hand gripped his arm tightly, shaking him back to reality.

He blinked, the vision fading, the forest snapping back into focus. The sky was still gray, the trees still swayed gently in the breeze. But the Veil’s presence was still there, lurking at the edges of his mind, waiting for him to slip again.

Sari’s eyes searched his face, her brow furrowed with worry. “You’re not okay,” she said softly. “What’s happening to you?”

Talon swallowed hard, his throat tight. He wanted to tell her. He wanted to explain what he was seeing, what he was feeling. But how could he explain something he barely understood himself? How could he tell her that the Veil was warping his mind, twisting his perception of reality, and that he was losing the fight to control it?

“It’s nothing,” he said, his voice strained. “I’m fine.”

But Sari didn’t look convinced. “Talon… I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what’s going on.”

He shook his head, pulling his arm free from her grip. “You can’t help with this, Sari. No one can.”

Her eyes softened, her voice quiet. “Maybe if you stopped fighting it… maybe the Veil wouldn’t—”

“No!” Talon snapped, cutting her off. “You don’t understand. It’s not just… it’s not just a power, Sari. It’s alive. It’s manipulating me. It wants something, but I don’t know what.”

Sari’s eyes widened in shock, but she didn’t back away. “Then we need to figure out what it wants before it—”

“I don’t know if we can,” Talon said, his voice barely more than a whisper. “It’s too powerful. I’m not strong enough.”

The confession left him feeling raw, exposed. He had never admitted that before—not to Sari, not to Griffin, not even to himself. But now, standing here in the midst of the warped forest, the weight of the Veil pressing down on him, he couldn’t deny it any longer.

He wasn’t strong enough.

Sari’s hand hovered near his arm, as if she wanted to comfort him but didn’t know how. “Talon… you’re stronger than you think. We’ll figure this out. Together.”

But Talon wasn’t sure if they could. The Veil was growing stronger every day, its grip on him tightening with every passing moment. And the worst part was, a small part of him didn’t want to fight it anymore.

A small part of him wanted to give in.
