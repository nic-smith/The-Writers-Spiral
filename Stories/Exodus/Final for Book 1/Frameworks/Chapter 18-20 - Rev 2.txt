**Chapter 18: Eowyn’s Betrayal Begins**

- **Purpose**: 
  - This chapter introduces the **first signs of Eowyn’s betrayal**. The group begins to suspect something is off with her, though no one is sure what exactly is happening. The **Revenant’s return** signals that Metis’s forces are adapting, and the psychological tension within the group starts to unravel.
  
- **Writing Style**: 
  - The tone should be **tense and suspicious**, reflecting the growing distrust. Eowyn’s subtle shift in behavior should create an undercurrent of **unease**, while the action sequences with the Revenant should be fast-paced but fragmented by Talon’s increasing paranoia.

- **Key Events**:
  1. **Talon’s Distrust**: Talon begins to notice small changes in Eowyn—her advice is colder, her decisions more calculated, and she’s pulling away emotionally. These moments are subtle but enough to **plant seeds of doubt**.
  2. **Revenant’s Return**: The group is ambushed by the Revenant, which has evolved into an even more lethal enemy. Talon uses the medallion, but this time, the **Veil seems to be pushing back**, testing his control. Hallucinations plague him during the battle, and he feels like he’s fighting on two fronts.
  3. **Talon’s Fear of Losing Control**: As Talon fights the Revenant, the **Veil’s influence grows**, making his visions more intense. He begins to fear that the medallion is trying to control him, rather than the other way around.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Suspicious and conflicted**, unsure whether he can trust Eowyn or the medallion. The hallucinations are warping his perception, and he’s starting to feel **isolated** from the group.
  - **Sari**: **Concerned and frustrated**. She notices Talon’s distance but doesn’t understand why. She’s also wary of Eowyn but is unwilling to fully confront the issue yet.
  - **Eowyn**: **Cold and calculating**, subtly setting up the group for her eventual betrayal. She’s testing the waters, seeing how much she can manipulate Talon before the truth comes out.

- **Writing Style Notes**: The chapter should blend moments of **suspense** and **confusion**. Talon’s growing paranoia is mirrored in the writing, with fragmented sentences and distorted perceptions during his hallucinations. The **tension** is building, but the full betrayal isn’t revealed yet.

### **Chapter 19: The Revenant’s Hunt**

- **Purpose**: 
  - The group faces a relentless pursuit by the Revenant, now more deadly than ever. **Eowyn’s betrayal is still in the shadows**, but her actions become more overt in subtly sabotaging the group. Talon’s mental state continues to degrade, with hallucinations becoming harder to control.

- **Writing Style**: 
  - The tone is **desperate and paranoid**. The Revenant’s presence is constant, like a predator stalking its prey, while Eowyn’s manipulations create internal division within the group. Talon’s hallucinations should blend more seamlessly into reality, leaving the reader questioning what’s real.

  3. **The Revenant’s Evolution**: The group realizes that the Revenant has **learned from their previous encounter**. It anticipates their moves, using strategies that show **Metis’s intelligence behind it**. The fight feels personal, as if the Revenant has been specifically designed to hunt them down.
  4. **Talon’s Vision of Destruction**: During the chase, Talon experiences another intense vision from the Veil—this time, he sees himself as a **destroyer**, wielding the medallion’s power to wipe out everything around him. This vision leaves him terrified of his own potential.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Fearful and paranoid**. The hallucinations are blending with reality, making him doubt everyone around him, including Sari. He feels the medallion is **controlling him**, and he’s losing his grip on reality.
  - **Sari**: **Confused and hurt**. She feels Talon pulling away, and she can sense the growing danger from both Eowyn and the Revenant. She’s torn between trying to protect Talon and confronting the truth about Eowyn.
  - **Eowyn**: **Calm and calculating**. She’s playing a long game, knowing that the group’s destruction is inevitable. She’s content to let the Revenant do the dirty work while she continues to undermine Talon’s trust in himself and the group.

- **Writing Style Notes**: The tone of this chapter should feel **claustrophobic** and **relentless**, reflecting both the physical pursuit by the Revenant and Talon’s growing mental breakdown. The **hallucinations** should feel more real than ever, leaving the reader, like Talon, unsure of what’s real.
