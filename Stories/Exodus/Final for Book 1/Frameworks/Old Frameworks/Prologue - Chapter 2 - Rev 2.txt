### **Prologue: Fractured Visions**

- **Purpose**: Introduce the reader to a **critical moment of action** (the future fight with the Eidolons), while layering in **cryptic visions** that give fragmented hints about the medallion, Talon’s family history, and the Veil. This establishes the tone of the book and provides context for the mystery.
- **Writing Style**: **Gothic-driven action**, with moments of intense, visceral combat interspersed with slow-motion, **hallucinatory sequences**. The prose should be fast and sharp during the action, with **sparse, jagged sentences** to create a sense of panic. When Talon slips into visions, the writing should become **disjointed**, with dreamlike, surreal imagery that makes the reader feel **unmoored** from reality.
- **Key Events**:
  - Talon, Griffin, and Sari are ambushed by **Eidolons** in a dense, oppressive forest. The **Eidolons** move in perfect synchrony, as though they are a single entity controlled by **Metis**.
  - As the battle rages, Talon is momentarily **stunned** by the force of the medallion’s energy surging through him. Time seems to slow down for him as he’s thrown into a vision.
  - **Vision 1**: Talon sees flashes of an ancient **Mayan temple**, with **glyphs matching** those on his medallion. He doesn’t understand the connection, but he feels the weight of the medallion’s history. This is his first glimpse into the **Mayan world**.
  - **Vision 2**: Talon is pulled into another vision of an **alien world**—it’s disjointed, but he sees **alien structures**, humanoid figures, and a sense of **great loss**. He feels the **Veil’s presence**, but it’s still elusive.
  - **Dialogue Tie-in**: As Talon hears **Griffin shout** in the real world, the vision fragments and pulls him back to reality. The reader gets a sense of **déjà vu**, though they won’t fully understand the significance until later in the book.
  - The prologue ends with the group still in the middle of the battle, setting the stage for **chapter 1**, where we’ll jump back in time and revisit the same fight in real time.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Disoriented** and overwhelmed. He’s grappling with the medallion’s power and the cryptic visions that he doesn’t understand. There’s fear, but also a sense of **responsibility**—he knows the medallion is important, but he can’t grasp why.
  - **Griffin**: **Frustrated** and angry. He’s convinced that the medallion is drawing the Eidolons to them. His protectiveness toward the group is clashing with his distrust of Talon and the medallion.
  - **Sari**: **Focused and anxious**. She’s trying to keep the group together, emotionally and physically, but the chaos of the situation is fraying her nerves.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
  - Use **short, punchy sentences** during the combat to increase tension and reflect the chaos of the moment.
  - When Talon slips into his visions, the prose should become **fluid and surreal**, mimicking the feeling of losing touch with reality. Time should feel stretched, with disjointed imagery that’s both cryptic and symbolic.
  - Dialogue during the visions should be **fragmented** and **echo-like**, reinforcing the surreal quality of the visions.

### **Chapter 1: On the Run**

- **Purpose**: Establish the **group dynamic** as they flee from the Eidolons through the forest. Set the emotional tone of **fear**, **urgency**, and **tension** as they escape. This chapter ties back to the prologue’s fight, slowly building up to the same encounter from the prologue but in real time. Begin to hint at the medallion’s powers and how they’re connected to the **Veil**.
- **Writing Style**: **Tense and action-driven**, with a growing sense of dread. The prose should reflect the **constant motion** of the characters, giving the reader little room to breathe as they race to escape. Use **sharp, staccato sentences** to mirror the high-stakes situation.
- **Key Events**:
  - The group is **running through the forest**, the Eidolons hunting them relentlessly. The forest is dense, dark, and oppressive, almost like it’s **closing in on them**.
  - **Griffin voices his suspicion** that the medallion is somehow responsible for attracting the Eidolons. Talon doesn’t have the energy to argue, but the tension between them is palpable.
  - As they flee, Talon feels the **medallion’s pull** growing stronger, but he doesn’t understand its significance. It’s been passed down through his family for generations, but its true power and purpose are unknown.
  - The chapter ends as they reach the same moment from the prologue—the ambush by the Eidolons. But this time, we’re seeing it from the group’s perspective in **real time**, setting the stage for the **déjà vu** moments that will tie into the prologue.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Worried** and **uncertain**. He feels the medallion pulling him in different directions, but he doesn’t know how to control it or what it really means. His **fear of the unknown** is clashing with his desire to protect the group.
  - **Griffin**: **Frustrated** and **angry**. He feels like they’re being hunted because of the medallion, and his distrust of Talon is growing. He’s protective of Sari, but that protectiveness is now turning into **resentment** toward Talon.
  - **Sari**: **Focused** but **anxious**. She’s trying to keep the group moving and keep the peace between Talon and Griffin, but the weight of the situation is starting to show.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
  - **Fast-paced action**, with quick, sharp dialogue that reflects the tension of the moment. Use **internal monologues** sparingly to show Talon’s growing confusion and frustration with the medallion.
  - The **déjà vu moments** should be subtle but noticeable—lines of dialogue from the prologue mirrored in this chapter, giving the reader a sense that something **otherworldly** is happening beneath the surface.

### **Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

- **Purpose**: Begin to show the **medallion’s influence** on Talon more clearly. Introduce the first hints of the **Veil’s power**, but keep it cryptic. This chapter builds the **mystery** surrounding the medallion and deepens the tension within the group. The **alien visions** start to become more vivid, but Talon is still unsure of their significance.
- **Writing Style**: **Atmospheric** and **introspective**, with a blend of action and Talon’s internal struggle with the medallion. The pacing should be slower here, allowing for more moments of reflection, but there’s still a constant undercurrent of tension as the group continues to flee.
- **Key Events**:
  - The group continues their escape through the forest, but Talon starts experiencing more **frequent visions**. The visions are still fragmented, showing flashes of **alien structures**, **humanoid figures**, and cryptic **symbols** that he can’t decipher.
  - **Griffin’s frustration** with Talon grows as the medallion’s power becomes more apparent. He accuses Talon of relying too much on the medallion, thinking it’s attracting the creatures.
  - Talon recalls moments from his childhood when the medallion was seen as a symbol of **prosperity**, but he now begins to doubt its true purpose. The medallion’s **glyphs glow faintly** at odd moments, but Talon is unsure whether it’s responding to something or if it’s just his imagination.
  - The chapter ends with another **alien vision**—this time, Talon sees more clearly the **alien beings** who once tried to control the Veil but were consumed by its power. He feels an intense pull toward the medallion, but the vision ends abruptly.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Conflicted** and increasingly **paranoid**. He’s starting to feel the weight of the medallion’s power, but he doesn’t know if it’s a tool or a curse. The visions are becoming more intense, and he’s not sure if he can trust his own mind.
  - **Griffin**: **Angry** and **distrustful**. He’s convinced that the medallion is causing their problems, and his resentment toward Talon is growing. He’s protective of the group, but that protectiveness is starting to manifest as **hostility**.
  - **Sari**: **Worried** and **unsure**. She senses the growing tension between Talon and Griffin, but she doesn’t know how to diffuse it. She’s torn between supporting Talon

- **Emotional State** (Sari):
  - **Sari**: **Worried** and **unsure**. She senses the growing tension between Talon and Griffin, but she doesn’t know how to diffuse it. She’s torn between supporting Talon—who seems increasingly troubled by the medallion’s power—and listening to Griffin, who fears the medallion is becoming a liability. Her **empathy** makes her a stabilizing presence, but internally, she is starting to fear that the group may be unraveling.

- **Writing Style Notes**:
  - The writing in this chapter should reflect the **growing tension** within the group, with moments of **psychological unease**. Talon’s visions should have a **dreamlike quality**, with fragmented imagery that feels otherworldly and cryptic. 
  - Dialogue between Talon and Griffin should be **tense and strained**, hinting at the deeper conflict between them as they grapple with the medallion’s influence.
  - **Pacing**: Slow the action here to focus more on the characters’ internal struggles, but keep the **sense of danger** looming in the background as the group remains in survival mode.
