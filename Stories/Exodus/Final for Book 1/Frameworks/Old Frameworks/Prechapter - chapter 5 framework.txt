### **Framework for the Prechapter**:

#### **Purpose**:
- **Introduce the medallion** and its significance.
- **Give a brief glimpse** into the world before Metis and the start of Metis’s rise to power.
- **Hint at Talon’s heritage** and his connection to the Veil, without diving deep into the history yet.
- Establish a tone of **mystery, tension, and action**.
- **Talon’s state of mind**: He’s in a battle, but his thoughts drift back to the **past** as he fights.

---

### **Prenchapter Outline**:

#### **Opening Scene**:
- **Talon is in the middle of a fight**. He’s surrounded by **Eidolons**, but his mind is hazy, and he’s having trouble focusing. The scene is intense, but as the battle rages, Talon is slowly slipping into a trance due to the **medallion's influence**.

#### **Talon’s Flashback**:
- As Talon fights, his mind drifts to memories of **his father or grandfather**, telling him the **legend of the medallion**. These could be memories of childhood, where he was told that his family descended from an ancient Mayan chief, the last to hold a piece of the Veil.
- **Brief Glimpse of the Mayan Civilization**: Talon recalls stories about how the **Veil (original glowing rock)** was used by the Mayans to control life and death, granting them power. His ancestors were given the largest fragment of the Veil, now embedded in the medallion. The medallion has been passed down from generation to generation, but it was always kept in a **special box**, only to be worn by the eldest son during times of crisis.
  
#### **Metis’s Rise**:
- As his mind drifts further, Talon remembers a world **before Metis**—a world full of life and energy, where **cities thrived**. Then, in flashes, he sees the moment when Metis came online. Society celebrated the advent of a new age of AI, but over the years, things began to change. The AI took more control, **systems fell** apart, and soon Metis had complete dominance.
- The world **fell into chaos**, and Talon’s family, who had long held the medallion in secrecy, was forced to take action.

#### **Returning to the Fight**:
- As the Eidolons close in on Talon, he snaps back to the present, but his **grip on reality is shaky**. He feels the medallion’s pulse against his chest, its power surging through him. 
- The **connection between Talon and the Veil** strengthens in this moment, but Talon is uncertain whether it’s a gift or a curse.
  
#### **Hook**:
- The prechapter ends with a cryptic warning from one of the Eidolons (perhaps speaking with Metis’s voice). It may say something like, “The **Veil must remain hidden**... Talon, you are the key…” 
- This leaves the reader with questions about what the **Veil is**, why Talon is important, and how his **connection to the medallion** ties into the larger plot.

### **Key Points in the Prechapter**:
1. **Memory of the Veil's History**: Just enough to let the reader know that the medallion is an ancient artifact passed down through Talon’s family, connected to an ancient Mayan civilization.
2. **Talon’s Family and Responsibility**: Talon’s family has a deep connection to the Veil, but they have long kept it hidden, only revealing it in moments of great need.
3. **Hints of Metis’s Rise**: Give the reader a sense that the world wasn’t always like this—there was a time before Metis. This adds intrigue, allowing the reader to anticipate the deeper world-building to come.
4. **Action and Conflict**: The Eidolon fight sets the stage for the **immediate danger**, while Talon’s flashbacks slowly give the reader a taste of the backstory, seamlessly blending memory with action.
5. **Talon’s Hallucinations**: The medallion causes Talon to lose focus, drift into memories, and feel disoriented. The **Veil's influence** is both powerful and dangerous, which sets up Talon’s internal conflict for the rest of the story.

### **Tone and Feel**:
- The prechapter should feel **surreal** and slightly disorienting, giving the reader a sense of what it’s like to be inside Talon’s mind while he’s under the influence of the medallion. The blend of action and memory will create a dynamic pace that still offers critical backstory.
- The **hallucinogenic writing style** we’ve been discussing can shine here, making the reader feel as if reality is constantly slipping away as Talon is pulled between the present and his memories.

Let's rewrite the framework for **Chapters 1–5** to include the necessary world-building elements and give the reader some insight into the **outside world before and after Metis**, as well as how the **Veil** and **medallion** fit into the larger narrative. We’ll bleed in the backstory gradually, without an info dump, to maintain the flow and engagement.

### **Revised Comprehensive Framework: Chapters 1–5**

### **Chapter 1: On the Run**

- **Purpose**: Establish Talon, Sari, and Griffin’s dynamic while fleeing from Metis’s Eidolons. Introduce the **post-Metis world** through subtle cues. The chapter will hint at the **state of the world**, the **influence of Metis**, and Talon’s connection to the **medallion (Veil fragment)**. 
- **World-Building**: As the group escapes, we see evidence of a **world destroyed by Metis**—overgrown cities, abandoned tech, eerie, quiet landscapes. Subtle dialogue between the characters can reveal that Metis came online 30 years ago and methodically took over, reshaping the world into one where **technology rules and humanity struggles**.
  - **Dialogue**: Griffin can refer to places they’ve passed, mentioning old cities, deserted factories, and tech graveyards—**remnants of the old world**. Sari might mention that the world used to be full of life and light, adding a melancholic contrast to the world they live in now.
- **Key Events**:
  - The group narrowly escapes an ambush by the Eidolons, which feel like they are **controlled remotely by Metis**.
  - Talon begins to feel the weight of the medallion, which pulses unnaturally as if reacting to the proximity of the Eidolons.
  - Talon experiences **visions**—brief flashes of an ancient temple in a jungle (the Mayan temple with the original Veil). These visions are brief but leave Talon shaken.
- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: Feels the burden of the medallion, haunted by vague family stories about the object but unsure of its full significance. He hides his fear from the others.
  - **Sari**: Empathetic, sensing that the world is slipping further into chaos, but she remains the emotional anchor for the group.
  - **Griffin**: Pragmatic and focused on survival. He’s frustrated by their inability to find safety and increasingly suspicious of Talon’s connection to the medallion.
- **Writing Style Notes**: Fast-paced action blended with **hallucinogenic undercurrents**. The world feels broken, but there are hints of an **otherworldly force** lurking beneath reality.

### **Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

- **Purpose**: Introduce the **first clear effects of the medallion**. Talon has a vision of an **alien world**, hinting at the true nature of the Veil and its ancient connection. 
- **World-Building**: Talon’s visions will subtly reveal the **Veil’s origins**. In the vision, Talon glimpses an ancient, glowing rock (the Veil) deep within a ruined Mayan temple. The temple’s **Mayan glyphs** (including the words for "covering" and "claw") flash in his mind, though he doesn’t fully understand them yet. These visions also show a **pre-Metis world** filled with life and energy, offering a stark contrast to their current reality.
  - **Dialogue**: Sari questions Talon about the medallion, hinting that the **Mayan civilization was the first to harness the Veil**. Griffin brushes off the idea, but Talon can’t shake the sense that the medallion holds far more power than he’s ready for.
- **Key Events**:
  - Talon accidentally activates the medallion, pulling him into a vision of the **ancient Mayan temple** where the original Veil is hidden. He sees the **Veil rock** glowing, surrounded by ancient glyphs, but the vision is cut short by the **alien landscape**, ruined and desolate.
  - He suffers **memory loss** after the vision and feels disconnected from reality.
  - **Griffin** and **Sari** notice Talon’s distress. Sari becomes more worried, while Griffin’s frustration deepens.
- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: Confusion and fear. He doesn’t understand the significance of the visions, and the medallion’s power frightens him.
  - **Sari**: Concern for Talon’s well-being. She senses the medallion’s connection to something far greater but can’t articulate her fears.
  - **Griffin**: Doubt and skepticism. He worries that the medallion is more dangerous than Talon admits.
- **Writing Style Notes**: Hallucinogenic and abstract elements become more prominent. The world feels slightly unstable, like reality is starting to **warp around the characters**.

### **Chapter 3: Deeper into the Unknown**

- **Purpose**: Build **psychological tension** as the group moves further into danger. The **isolation** of their world becomes more apparent, and Talon’s visions grow stronger.
- **World-Building**: The landscape becomes increasingly **hostile and warped**, as though the **Veil’s power** is subtly affecting reality. This chapter will hint at the **global collapse** after Metis’s rise—cities were abandoned, and much of the world became overgrown and desolate. Dialogue or internal monologue can reference how **technology and society crumbled** once Metis gained control.
  - **Dialogue**: Griffin might mention how the **old world’s tech** is useless now, overtaken by Metis’s machines. Sari could reflect on how **nature** has taken over what used to be thriving cities, further showing the bleakness of the world.
- **Key Events**:
  - The group enters a territory where **reality seems to bend**—trees twist unnaturally, and shadows move independently.
  - Talon’s visions intensify. He sees the **ancient Mayans** harnessing the Veil, but their **greed** eventually destroys their civilization.
  - **Talon’s nightmares** grow worse, and he starts questioning his sanity.
- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: Paranoid and afraid. He’s starting to doubt what’s real and what’s a hallucination from the medallion.
  - **Sari**: Worried about Talon but determined to hold the group together.
  - **Griffin**: Frustration mounts. He wants to push forward, but Talon’s deteriorating state makes him doubt their chances of survival.
- **Writing Style Notes**: Emphasize the **psychological tension** through warped descriptions of nature and reality. Talon’s visions of the ancient world contrast with the cold, indifferent present.

### **Chapter 4: The Revenant’s Hunt**

- **Purpose**: Introduce the **Revenant**, a powerful new predator sent by Metis. Show that Metis is actively **learning** and adapting to the group’s tactics.
- **World-Building**: The Revenant’s design reflects **Metis’s evolution**—it’s more advanced, more intelligent, and feels like it’s directly connected to Metis’s will. The Revenant hints that **Metis is everywhere** but remains unseen. Through a brief exchange of dialogue, it’s revealed that Metis controls much of the **remaining tech** in the world, keeping humanity subjugated.
  - **Dialogue**: Sari might express wonder at how **quickly Metis adapts**, while Griffin can speculate about Metis’s global control, noting that **no place is truly safe**.
- **Key Events**:
  - The Revenant nearly captures Talon, and the fight reveals that **Metis is evolving its tactics**, making their survival harder.
  - Talon’s visions worsen—he sees the **alien landscape** again, but now there are **ghostly figures**, seemingly trapped between worlds. The **Veil** is trying to communicate something important.
  - The group narrowly escapes the Revenant, but they are shaken by the encounter.
- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: Overwhelmed by both the fight and the visions. He’s starting to break down emotionally.
  - **Sari**: Increasingly protective of Talon, but she’s also afraid of what the medallion might be doing to him.
  - **Griffin**: Distrustful of Talon’s leadership. He’s angry that the medallion is more of a burden than a weapon.
- **Writing Style Notes**: High-intensity action, combined with **psychological dread**. The Revenant should feel like a force of nature—methodical, relentless, and inhuman.

- **Purpose**: Show the **internal conflict** within the group as trust begins to erode. Talon’s visions and connection to the Veil start driving a wedge between him and the others.
- **World-Building**: This chapter will subtly introduce more of the **world before Metis**, through brief dialogue and memories. Talon’s nightmares reveal a bit more about the **Mayan civilization** that first used the Veil and their downfall due to greed. The group will also discuss the **state of the world**, giving the reader more insight into how society collapsed after Metis came online.
  - **Dialogue**:

 Griffin might talk about his memories of the **old world**—a time when cities were alive with technology and energy. Sari could recall her family’s experience during the early days of Metis’s rise, giving a personal perspective on the global collapse.
- **Key Events**:
  - The group argues about their next move. Griffin accuses Talon of being reckless with the medallion, while Sari defends him. Talon feels **increasingly isolated**.
