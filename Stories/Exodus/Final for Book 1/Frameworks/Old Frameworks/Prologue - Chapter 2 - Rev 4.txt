### **Prologue: Fractured Visions**

#### **Purpose**:
- Set the tone with an intense mix of **action and psychological tension**. The prologue must establish the **Veil’s influence** on Talon and hint at his role in an ancient prophecy. 
- Introduce early **tension within the group**, showing Talon’s internal struggle, Griffin’s distrust, and Sari’s emotional connection to Talon.

#### **Writing Style**:
- Blend **fast-paced action** with **hallucinatory, disorienting visions**. The action sequences should be tight and intense, while Talon’s visions should slow the pace and feel surreal, creating a jarring contrast between reality and the Veil’s influence.
- Use **vivid, eerie imagery** to describe how the environment reacts to Talon’s use of the medallion. The physical effects on Talon should feel visceral and unavoidable.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Ambush and Possession**: Talon, Griffin, and Sari are ambushed by **Eidolons**, shadowy creatures sent by Metis. Talon taps into the medallion’s power during the battle, feeling a moment of **euphoria and control**. His appearance briefly changes—his eyes glow, his skin matches the medallion’s glyphs.
2. **The Physical Marking**: After the battle, Talon notices that the **glyphs on his skin** have become permanent and painful, a sign that the medallion’s power is starting to take root within him. This physical transformation begins to scare Talon but also intrigues him.
3. **Talon’s Growing Rationalization**: Talon begins to rationalize his connection to the medallion, wondering if the power is truly a curse or if it’s his **destiny**. He feels conflicted, pulled between fear and the thrill of control.

#### **Emotional State**:
- **Talon**: Conflicted between **fear and temptation**. He’s afraid of losing control but is also fascinated by the power the medallion offers. He begins to rationalize his actions, telling himself that using the medallion may be the only way to protect the group.
- **Griffin**: Distrustful and suspicious of Talon. Griffin notices Talon’s **physical changes** and is deeply worried that Talon is becoming a threat, not just to the group but to reality itself.
- **Sari**: Emotionally connected to Talon but growing concerned. Sari is torn between her loyalty to him and the growing evidence that Talon may not be able to resist the medallion’s power.

#### **Writing Style Notes**:
- **Talon’s internal monologue** should dominate, showcasing his conflicted feelings and early rationalizations. Keep his fear and fascination balanced—he should be both repelled and drawn in by the medallion’s power.
- The **physical effects** of the medallion need to be visceral—burning glyphs, glowing eyes, and moments of transformation should add a sense of growing inevitability.

#### **Backstory Elements**:
- Introduce the idea that the **glyphs on Talon’s skin** connect him to an ancient prophecy tied to the Veil. This prophecy is both a promise of power and a curse, marking him as someone who could either save or destroy reality. This hints at the cosmic scale of Talon’s choices.

### **Chapter 1: On the Run**

#### **Purpose**:
- Escalate the tension within the group as Talon’s temptation grows and Griffin’s suspicions deepen. The group should feel increasingly fractured as they begin to realize that **Talon’s connection to the medallion** is not something they can simply escape from.
- Introduce the **goal to find the Seer**, giving the group a direction and heightening the sense of urgency.

#### **Writing Style**:
- Keep the **pacing tense** and the action relentless as the group flees the **Eidolons**. But intersperse moments of **quiet reflection** for Talon, allowing the reader to see him justify his use of the medallion.
- Use the forest setting to amplify the **sense of isolation and dread**—the environment should feel like it’s closing in on them, reflecting Talon’s growing sense of inevitability.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Talon Uses the Medallion Deliberately**: While fleeing, Talon uses the medallion’s power again, not out of necessity but because he **wants** to feel the power. He tells himself it’s to protect the group, but deep down, he’s starting to crave the control it gives him.
2. **Griffin’s Suspicion Grows**: After witnessing Talon’s deliberate use of the medallion, Griffin becomes more aggressive in his distrust. He pulls Sari aside and begins to plant the idea that they may need to **take action** against Talon if he becomes a danger.
3. **Sari’s Emotional Conflict**: Sari, sensing that Talon is growing more distant, tries to **talk to him** about the medallion’s influence, but Talon brushes her off. She begins to fear that **saving him may come at a great cost**—either to herself or their connection.

#### **Emotional State**:
- **Talon**: Starting to feel a sense of **ownership** over the medallion’s power. He no longer feels the same level of fear and is beginning to rationalize his actions more actively. He feels like he can control the medallion, but he’s growing **more emotionally distant** from the group.
- **Griffin**: Griffin’s fear is turning into desperation. He’s actively considering a way to stop Talon from **becoming consumed** by the Veil, even if that means betraying him. His protectiveness of Sari drives his decisions, and he’s preparing for the worst.
- **Sari**: Sari is emotionally torn. She’s beginning to see that **Talon is changing**, and it scares her. But she’s still holding onto hope that she can save him, even if that means risking her own emotional well-being.

#### **Writing Style Notes**:
- Talon’s growing **detachment** from the group should be clear in the way he interacts with Griffin and Sari. His rationalizations should feel defensive, and his emotional distance should increase.
- The **tension between Griffin and Talon** should be more explicit—Griffin’s growing desperation needs to be palpable, and his conversations with Sari should carry the weight of a man preparing for a betrayal.

### **Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

#### **Purpose**:
- Bring Talon to the **brink of surrendering** to the Veil’s power, while also pushing **Sari and Griffin** to their breaking points. This chapter should focus on the group’s fractured relationships as the Veil’s influence warps not only reality but also their perception of each other.

#### **Writing Style**:
- Slow the pacing down slightly to allow for **psychological tension** to build. The group is still on the run, but now the primary focus is on their **fracturing trust**. Use the **hallucinogenic effects of the Veil** to distort their memories and create paranoia.
- The atmosphere should be more **claustrophobic**, with reality itself warping in strange, unsettling ways. Emphasize how the Veil’s power is **eroding their minds**, not just the environment.

#### **Key Events**:
1. **Distorted Reality**: The group begins to experience severe **reality warping**—they see visions of **alternate futures** where they’ve already failed. Talon sees a vision of himself as a **god-like ruler**, reshaping the world in his image. This vision pushes him toward **accepting the Veil**.
2. **Talon’s Near-Surrender**: Talon is shown a vision where he fully **embraces the Veil** and controls its power. He feels the pull to **surrender** completely and nearly does so, believing that his destiny is to **reshape reality**. But the vision comes with a **physical toll**—Talon experiences intense pain, a sign that his body is already transforming into the Veil’s vessel.
3. **Griffin’s Betrayal**: Griffin, convinced that Talon is beyond saving, **attempts to kill him** by forcibly removing the medallion. The confrontation becomes violent, and Talon is left near death. Griffin’s actions fracture the group’s trust completely.
4. **Sari’s Sacrifice**: Sari intervenes and makes the ultimate decision to **save Talon**. She knows that saving him will come at the cost of their connection, but she can’t let him die. This moment defines her character arc—she sacrifices part of herself to save someone she knows may never be the same again.

#### **Emotional State**:
- **Talon**: On the verge of **complete surrender** to the Veil, Talon nearly gives in to the power, convinced that it’s his destiny to rule. But Griffin’s betrayal shocks him back to reality, and he realizes how much he’s lost control.
- **Griffin**: Fully committed to his betrayal, Griffin’s actions are driven by **desperation and fear**. He believes killing Talon is the only way to stop the Veil from consuming reality, but his decision comes at the cost of the group’s unity.
- **Sari**: In her most emotionally vulnerable state, Sari must decide whether to **let Talon die**

 or save him, knowing that she’s losing him emotionally. Her choice to save him defines her loyalty but also forces her to confront the fact that she may never get the **Talon she loves** back.

#### **Writing Style Notes**:
- Emphasize the **psychological paranoia** created by the Veil’s reality distortion. The group’s interactions should feel tense and fraught with mistrust, and Sari’s emotional turmoil should be palpable as she makes her decision.
- Use the **visions of alternate futures** to push the characters to their emotional breaking points.

#### **Backstory Elements**:
- The **Veil’s prophecy** should be fully revealed in this chapter—Talon was always meant to choose between **godhood** and **humanity**, and his near-surrender shows how dangerously close he is to becoming the prophecy’s instrument of destruction.

### **Final Thoughts**:
This comprehensive framework now delivers on **high emotional stakes**, **character-driven conflict**, and a deep exploration of the **Veil’s influence**. The progression of Talon’s internal conflict, the group’s fractured trust, and Sari’s ultimate sacrifice come together to create a powerful and emotionally charged narrative.
