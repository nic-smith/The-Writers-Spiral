### **Chapter 18: Eowyn’s Betrayal Begins**

- **Purpose**:  
  This chapter introduces the **first signs of Eowyn’s betrayal**. The group begins to suspect something is off with her, though no one is sure what exactly is happening. The **Revenant’s return** signals that Metis’s forces are adapting, and the psychological tension within the group starts to unravel.
  
- **Writing Style**:  
  The tone should be **tense and suspicious**, reflecting the growing distrust. Eowyn’s subtle shift in behavior should create an undercurrent of **unease**, while the action sequences with the Revenant should be fast-paced but fragmented by Talon’s increasing paranoia.

- **Key Events**:
  1. **Talon’s Distrust**: Talon begins to notice small changes in Eowyn—her advice is colder, her decisions more calculated, and she’s pulling away emotionally. These moments are subtle but enough to **plant seeds of doubt**.
  2. **Revenant’s Return**: The group is ambushed by the Revenant, which has evolved into an even more lethal enemy. Talon uses the medallion, but this time, the **Veil seems to be pushing back**, testing his control. Hallucinations plague him during the battle, and he feels like he’s fighting on two fronts.
  3. **Talon’s Fear of Losing Control**: As Talon fights the Revenant, the **Veil’s influence grows**, making his visions more intense. He begins to fear that the medallion is trying to control him, rather than the other way around.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Suspicious and conflicted**, unsure whether he can trust Eowyn or the medallion. The hallucinations are warping his perception, and he’s starting to feel **isolated** from the group.
  - **Sari**: **Concerned and frustrated**. She notices Talon’s distance but doesn’t understand why. She’s also wary of Eowyn but is unwilling to fully confront the issue yet.
  - **Eowyn**: **Cold and calculating**, subtly setting up the group for her eventual betrayal. She’s testing the waters, seeing how much she can manipulate Talon before the truth comes out.

- **Writing Style Notes**: The chapter should blend moments of **suspense** and **confusion**. Talon’s growing paranoia is mirrored in the writing, with fragmented sentences and distorted perceptions during his hallucinations. The **tension** is building, but the full betrayal isn’t revealed yet.


### **Chapter 19: The Revenant’s Hunt**

- **Purpose**:  
  The group faces a relentless pursuit by the Revenant, now more deadly than ever. **Eowyn’s betrayal is still in the shadows**, but her actions become more overt in subtly sabotaging the group. Talon’s mental state continues to degrade, with hallucinations becoming harder to control.

- **Writing Style**:  
  The tone is **desperate and paranoid**. The Revenant’s presence is constant, like a predator stalking its prey, while Eowyn’s manipulations create internal division within the group. Talon’s hallucinations should blend more seamlessly into reality, leaving the reader questioning what’s real.

- **Key Events**:
  1. **Relentless Pursuit**: The group is being hunted by the Revenant, forced to flee through increasingly dangerous terrain. Talon tries to use the medallion, but it feels like he’s losing control. His hallucinations **become more vivid**, making it hard for him to distinguish friend from foe.
  2. **Eowyn’s Sabotage**: Eowyn continues to subtly sabotage the group, leading them into dead ends and making decisions that put them at greater risk. Talon begins to **suspect her**, but his paranoia makes him unsure if he’s seeing things clearly.
  3. **The Revenant’s Evolution**: The group realizes that the Revenant has **learned from their previous encounter**. It anticipates their moves, using strategies that show **Metis’s intelligence behind it**. The fight feels personal, as if the Revenant has been specifically designed to hunt them down.
  4. **Talon’s Vision of Destruction**: During the chase, Talon experiences another intense vision from the Veil—this time, he sees himself as a **destroyer**, wielding the medallion’s power to wipe out everything around him. This vision leaves him terrified of his own potential.

- **Emotional State**:
  - **Talon**: **Fearful and paranoid**. The hallucinations are blending with reality, making him doubt everyone around him, including Sari. He feels the medallion is **controlling him**, and he’s losing his grip on reality.
  - **Sari**: **Confused and hurt**. She feels Talon pulling away, and she can sense the growing danger from both Eowyn and the Revenant. She’s torn between trying to protect Talon and confronting the truth about Eowyn.
  - **Eowyn**: **Calm and calculating**. She’s playing a long game, knowing that the group’s destruction is inevitable. She’s content to let the Revenant do the dirty work while she continues to undermine Talon’s trust in himself and the group.


### **Chapter 20: Shattered Trust**

- **Purpose**:  
  This chapter brings the emotional fallout of the group’s escalating **internal tensions** to a peak, especially with the growing distrust of Eowyn. Talon’s **mental collapse** begins in earnest, and the **pressure of leadership** starts to feel unbearable as he grapples with the realization that Eowyn is working against them. Metis’s influence starts to **bleed through Eowyn**, though it’s still not fully revealed yet.

- **Writing Style**:  
  The style should reflect **heavy psychological pressure**, with moments of reflection and mental anguish. Talon’s inner voice is disjointed, with **hallucinatory flashes** that heighten his confusion and fear. The chapter also balances moments of external conflict with the **group’s weakening unity**.

- **Key Events**:
  1. **Group Distrust**: Eowyn is becoming more alienated from the group as Talon’s suspicion rises. Sari attempts to keep the peace, but Griffin and Talon’s **growing distrust** sets the stage for open conflict.
  2. **The Revenant’s Growing Threat**: The Revenant is spotted tracking the group. Talon, already on edge, **hesitates to use the medallion** in fear that the Veil is trying to control him. The **tension between trusting the medallion** and fearing it builds, and Talon starts questioning every choice.
  3. **Foreshadowing Eowyn’s Betrayal**: Eowyn’s **cold, calculated decisions** subtly sabotage the group’s chances of survival, leading to missteps and close calls in their attempts to evade the Revenant.
  4. **Hallucinations Intensify**: Talon experiences **disturbing visions**—he sees the group torn apart, the Veil growing in power, and himself losing control. He begins to suspect that the Veil is watching him, even **manipulating him through the medallion**.

- **Emotional State**:  
  - **Talon**: Torn between his instinctual distrust of Eowyn and his fear that the Veil is using him, Talon’s sense of **reality** begins to deteriorate.
  - **Sari**: She tries to keep the group together but feels **increasingly powerless** as Talon spirals and Eowyn distances herself.
  - **Griffin**: Growing impatient, he begins to openly question Talon’s decisions, especially in how to handle Eowyn and the medallion.
  - **Eowyn**: Subtly manipulative, keeping her true motives hidden, but slowly leading the group to disaster.
