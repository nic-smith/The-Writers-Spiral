Here’s what doesn’t work or could be improved for chapters 3 through 5:

### Chapter 3: Deeper into the Unknown
1. **Pacing and Vision Overload**: By this chapter, Talon’s visions are becoming too frequent. This not only risks repetition but may also slow the story’s pace unnecessarily. Readers might feel detached if they’re continually pulled into Talon’s visions without more clarity or development. Tighten the focus on key visions that serve the plot directly rather than multiple fragmented ones.
2. **Conflict Escalation Too Soon**: The tension between Talon and Griffin is already at a boiling point. This feels rushed. If their conflict escalates too quickly, you risk losing long-term dramatic tension. Stretch out the animosity and give them more moments of cooperation or reconciliation before things blow up completely.
3. **Atmosphere vs. Action**: The oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere is effective, but if it’s not balanced with forward momentum, it could make the story feel stagnant. Ensure there’s enough tangible progress—either with character growth or plot advancement—so readers don’t feel like they’re treading water in the forest.

### Chapter 4: The Revenant’s Hunt
1. **The Revenant as a New Threat**: While the Revenant is introduced as a more dangerous enemy, it risks being just a plot device if it doesn’t have depth. You mention it delivers a cryptic message from Metis, but if the Revenant’s nature, purpose, or abilities aren’t distinctive, it could feel like just another random monster. Flesh out its character or purpose a bit more, so it leaves a lasting impact.
2. **Talon’s Fear vs. Growth**: By this point, Talon is still only showing signs of fear and confusion with the medallion. There’s no real sense of progress in his relationship with its power. He needs moments of clarity, or small victories with the medallion to keep his character from feeling static. Otherwise, readers might get frustrated with his passivity.
3. **Griffin’s Breaking Point**: Griffin nearly turning on Talon during the fight is good, but if it happens too often, it can feel repetitive. Be careful with how often Griffin and Talon clash, or it risks making Griffin seem one-dimensional as only the antagonist within the group.

### Chapter 5: Trust Frayed
1. **Conflict Becoming Redundant**: At this point, the tension between Talon and Griffin is starting to feel repetitive. If their trust continues to break down in similar ways without new dimensions, it risks feeling cyclical. Add some variety—maybe a moment where Griffin almost backs down or reconsiders, only to double down later—so the conflict doesn’t feel like a flat arc.
2. **Sari’s Role**: Sari’s empathy and attempts to mediate are good, but she’s being reduced to a peacekeeper between the two men. She needs her own agenda or emotional depth beyond simply reacting to Talon and Griffin’s conflict. Maybe she begins to develop her own suspicions about the medallion or starts having her own experiences with the Veil.
3. **Talon’s Doubts**: Talon is questioning whether the medallion is controlling him, but this thought process has been consistent across the past few chapters. At some point, his internal conflict needs to develop further—either he starts to come to a decision about the medallion, or something external forces him to act one way or another.

### Overall Issues:
- **Conflict Escalation**: The tension between Talon and Griffin hits hard early and is sustained without much variation. While it’s important to show this growing distrust, you’ll need to vary their conflict to avoid it feeling repetitive. Introducing new stakes or temporary truces could keep it fresh.
- **Talon’s Lack of Agency**: Talon is reacting to the visions and the medallion rather than actively trying to understand or control it. Readers might get frustrated if the protagonist remains too passive for too long. Giving him moments where he takes some control or shows a new understanding could add to his growth.
- **Overuse of Visions**: Talon’s visions are happening frequently and with a similar tone. While it’s key to establish the mystery of the Veil, too many visions could disengage readers from the main action. Try consolidating the visions into more significant, plot-moving moments rather than numerous fragmented ones.

Addressing these issues should help with the pacing, character development, and overall impact of these chapters.
