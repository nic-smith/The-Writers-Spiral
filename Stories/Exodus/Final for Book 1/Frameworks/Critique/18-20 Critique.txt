Here’s what doesn’t work or could be improved for chapters 18 through 20:

### Chapter 18: Eowyn’s Betrayal Begins
1. **Eowyn’s Shift Feels Too Abrupt**: While subtle shifts in Eowyn’s behavior are a good way to build suspense, the group’s sudden suspicions might feel rushed. If the changes in her demeanor are too obvious, it undercuts the slow-burning tension of her betrayal. Make her manipulations even more ambiguous, so the group’s growing distrust feels gradual and realistic.
2. **Talon’s Fears Are Becoming Repetitive**: Talon’s struggle with the medallion and fear of losing control has been a recurring theme. At this point, there needs to be a significant change in how he interacts with the medallion or the Veil’s influence. Consider giving him a brief moment of clarity or control to add variety to his internal conflict before it deepens again.
3. **Revenant Feels Like a Repeated Threat**: The return of the Revenant, though important, risks feeling repetitive if the confrontation plays out similarly to previous encounters. To avoid this, introduce a new dynamic to the battle—perhaps the Revenant has a more personal connection to Metis or the group, adding emotional stakes beyond survival.

### Chapter 19: The Revenant’s Hunt
1. **Eowyn’s Sabotage is Predictable**: Eowyn’s manipulations are becoming more overt, and if they are too obvious to the reader, the twist loses its punch. Keep her actions more subtle or ambiguous until the final betrayal to maintain suspense.
2. **Talon’s Hallucinations Need Higher Stakes**: Talon’s hallucinations blending with reality is a good concept, but if the consequences remain internal, they lose their power. His paranoia and confusion should start leading to tangible consequences—perhaps he accidentally harms a member of the group or makes a critical error because of what he sees.
3. **The Revenant’s Personalization Could Be Stronger**: The Revenant evolving and anticipating the group’s moves is an exciting development, but the stakes could be raised further. Add more personal or symbolic significance to the Revenant, making it feel like a true extension of Metis’s will rather than a recurring enemy.

### Chapter 19.5: Eowyn’s Full Betrayal
1. **Betrayal Might Feel Overdue**: By this point, readers may already expect Eowyn’s betrayal due to earlier clues. The shock factor might be diminished if her actions have been telegraphed too clearly. Consider downplaying some of her earlier suspicious behavior to make this betrayal more impactful when it happens.
2. **Talon’s Collapse Feels Too Sudden**: Talon’s complete mental collapse during the battle may feel rushed if it happens without enough buildup. While his breakdown is necessary, stretching out his loss of control over several chapters would allow the emotional weight to land harder.
3. **Sari’s Role is Reactive**: Sari’s attempts to pull Talon back are understandable, but she’s still mostly reacting to Talon’s choices and Eowyn’s betrayal. Give her more proactive steps—perhaps she starts to take charge or tries to devise her own plan to save Talon rather than simply responding to events.

### Chapter 20: Collapse and Despair
1. **Talon’s Collapse Feels Familiar**: Talon’s mental breakdown has been building over several chapters, but by now, it feels too familiar. His retreat into himself and questioning of reality needs a new dimension—perhaps a significant revelation or vision from the Veil that fundamentally alters his perspective. This would elevate the stakes of his breakdown.
2. **Sari’s Helplessness is Repetitive**: Sari’s determination to help Talon is strong, but her feeling of helplessness has been a recurring theme. To keep her character engaging, she needs to take a more active role in finding a solution, even if it means going against Talon’s wishes.
3. **Eowyn’s Victory Could Be Explored More**: Eowyn’s betrayal and victory feel complete, but her character still lacks depth. Explore more of her internal motivations or offer hints about why she sided with Metis beyond simple cold calculation. This would make her more than just an obvious antagonist.

### Overall Issues:
- **Talon’s Struggles Are Becoming Repetitive**: His constant fear of losing control has been a central theme for several chapters. Add more variety to how he deals with the medallion or introduce an unexpected twist in his relationship with the Veil to keep things dynamic.
- **Eowyn’s Betrayal Is Too Predictable**: While the betrayal is important, if Eowyn’s actions have been too heavily hinted at, it risks losing its emotional punch. Make her actions more ambiguous until the full reveal to preserve the tension.
- **Sari Needs More Agency**: Sari is still reacting to events, and her role in the group is becoming too passive. Give her more moments where she takes control or makes independent decisions to make her character feel more integral to the narrative.

These adjustments should help maintain narrative tension and prevent repetitive character arcs while deepening the emotional stakes.
