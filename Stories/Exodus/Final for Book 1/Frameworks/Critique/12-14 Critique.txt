Here’s what doesn’t work or could be improved for chapters 12 through 14:

### Chapter 12: The Strain of Leadership
1. **Talon’s Leadership Struggles Feel Predictable**: Talon’s lack of confidence and failed decisions are expected, but they don’t add much new depth to his character. If he’s constantly second-guessing himself, it risks making him feel too passive. He needs moments where he surprises himself (and the group) by making a solid decision, even if it’s temporary, to keep the reader engaged with his leadership arc.
2. **Eowyn’s Influence Too Obvious**: Eowyn’s cold logic is starting to border on heavy-handed. While it’s fine for Sari to grow suspicious, Eowyn’s detachment could be more subtle to avoid making her appear like an immediate villain. Keep the suspicion building slowly, so when the reveal about her true nature happens, it’s more impactful.
3. **Hallucinations Need to Have Clear Consequences**: Talon’s hallucinations are creeping in, but they feel fleeting and easily dismissed. These need to carry more weight, affecting his decisions in a tangible way, rather than being brushed off as stress or exhaustion. Otherwise, readers might not feel the urgency of his mental decline.

### Chapter 13: Cracks in the Armor
1. **The Same Argument, Repeated**: Sari’s confrontations with Talon about the medallion are important, but they’re starting to feel repetitive. If their conversations always circle back to “the medallion is bad” without adding new dimensions to the debate, it risks stalling their relationship. Add complexity—perhaps Sari temporarily agrees with Talon, only to be drawn back into her distrust later, creating more layers to the conflict.
2. **Eowyn as the Logical Manipulator**: While it’s clear that Eowyn is manipulating the group, if she’s too robotic and pragmatic, readers will quickly guess her connection to Metis. Consider making her more emotionally convincing in some moments, so the group (and readers) are kept guessing longer. If she’s always detached, her true nature may become too obvious too soon.
3. **Talon’s Growing Disorientation**: Talon’s visions and hallucinations need to escalate beyond “fleeting glimpses.” By now, they should be affecting his perception in ways that make his decisions more erratic. The hallucinations should cause him to question not only reality but his own sense of self and control.

### Chapter 14: Rising Paranoia
1. **Talon’s Paranoia Progression Feels Rushed**: While Talon’s paranoia is important, it seems like it intensifies quickly in this chapter without enough of a buildup. Slower escalation—small, subtle signs that build over time—would make his breakdown feel more natural and harrowing. This rapid shift could feel unearned if it isn’t paced more gradually.
2. **Sari’s Distrust Could Lead to Action**: Sari’s frustration with Talon is now fully developed, but she’s still mostly reacting. She could start taking independent actions, such as investigating Eowyn on her own or preparing to intervene if Talon loses control. This would add more agency to her character instead of keeping her in a purely reactive role.
3. **Conflict Lacks Complexity**: The conflict between Talon and Sari is becoming predictable. If every confrontation centers on the same distrust of the medallion and Eowyn, it risks growing stale. Introduce new layers—maybe Talon shows signs of trusting Sari again briefly, or Sari considers taking the medallion away, leading to a more dynamic conflict.

### Overall Issues:
- **Predictability in Eowyn’s Manipulation**: Eowyn’s manipulation is becoming a bit too obvious. Her detachment and logical advice are clear signs to the group and readers that she’s not what she seems. Subtlety is key—let her blend in more naturally before the group begins to suspect her.
- **Repetitive Group Dynamics**: The arguments between Talon, Sari, and Eowyn are cycling through the same beats: distrust of the medallion, Talon’s struggle for control, and Sari’s suspicions. Vary the conflict by introducing new stakes or emotional layers. Maybe Sari has a moment of doubt, or Talon briefly believes he can control the medallion before it pulls him back under.
- **Talon’s Hallucinations Need to Escalate**: The hallucinations are an important part of Talon’s arc, but they’re still too easy for him to dismiss. These should begin to severely impact his decision-making and relationships, creating more tangible consequences for both Talon and the group.

These changes should help keep the narrative tension fresh and avoid the repetition that risks slowing the pace of these chapters.
