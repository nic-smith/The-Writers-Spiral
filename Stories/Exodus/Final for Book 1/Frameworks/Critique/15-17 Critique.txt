Here’s what doesn’t work or could be improved for chapters 15 through 17:

### Chapter 15: Rising Stakes
1. **Talon’s Repeated Struggles**: Talon’s increasing dependence on the medallion and his internal conflicts have been a central theme for multiple chapters, and it risks becoming repetitive. His character arc needs a new development—perhaps a moment where he realizes he is losing control but doesn’t care or an unexpected twist in his leadership role that pushes him into unfamiliar territory. The same struggle with the medallion risks stagnation.
2. **Eowyn’s Manipulation Feels Overly Obvious**: The seeds Eowyn plants to drive a wedge between Talon and Sari are becoming more overt. If her manipulations continue to be this visible to the reader, it could make the eventual reveal less impactful. Slow down her influence, making her advice seem reasonable at first, then subtly increase the manipulation without it being too obvious.
3. **Sari’s Role**: Sari’s continued attempts to pull Talon back from the brink are crucial, but she’s beginning to feel a bit one-dimensional as a character who simply reacts to Talon’s choices. Give her more proactive steps—perhaps a plan to confront Eowyn directly or find a way to deal with the medallion herself, allowing her to show more agency.

### Chapter 16: The Ambush
1. **Overuse of Eidolon Threats**: While the advanced Eidolons provide external conflict, the repetition of ambushes risks becoming predictable. If each battle is just a more difficult version of the last, the tension can start to feel manufactured. Consider varying the nature of these external threats—introduce different forms of danger or internal challenges that shift the stakes.
2. **Talon’s Loss of Control Feels Too Familiar**: The pattern of Talon using the medallion, losing control, and then feeling shaken is starting to feel formulaic. Add variation to how he reacts—perhaps in this instance, he relishes the power momentarily before realizing its danger, giving his emotional response more complexity.
3. **Lack of Character Development in Eowyn**: Eowyn’s manipulation continues to be cold and calculating, but her lack of emotional or personal depth could make her feel flat. Giving her more nuance—perhaps an internal conflict or a moment where she’s almost exposed but manages to convince everyone otherwise—would keep her more dynamic.

### Chapter 17: The Veil’s First Test
1. **Talon’s Growing Paranoia Needs a New Layer**: Talon’s paranoia and disorientation have been building, but they need more complexity in this chapter. Instead of just feeling paranoid about Sari and Eowyn, add another dimension—perhaps he starts to doubt his own memories or abilities, creating a deeper sense of unraveling.
2. **Eowyn’s Manipulation Is Too Linear**: Eowyn’s role in turning Talon against Sari is predictable, and her manipulation risks feeling too straightforward. If she subtly changes tactics or begins to express concern for Talon in a seemingly genuine way, it could add depth to her character and keep readers on their toes about her true intentions.
3. **Conflict with Sari Feels Predictable**: The argument between Talon and Sari, while necessary, risks feeling like a rehash of earlier conflicts. Adding more emotional stakes—perhaps Talon accuses Sari of something shocking or Sari takes a more aggressive stance—would keep this confrontation fresh and impactful.

### Overall Issues:
- **Repetition of Key Conflicts**: Talon’s internal struggle with the medallion and the repeated ambushes by Eidolons are starting to feel repetitive. Consider mixing up the types of conflict Talon faces—whether it’s a new threat, a moral dilemma, or a twist in his relationship with the medallion that feels unexpected.
- **Eowyn’s Manipulation Becoming Predictable**: Eowyn’s cold logic and manipulation of Talon are now very clear to the reader, and her lack of emotional depth is making her feel one-dimensional. Add complexity by showing cracks in her facade or making her manipulations more varied and subtle.
- **Sari’s Character Needs Agency**: Sari’s role has largely been reactive to Talon’s decisions. Give her more proactive steps to take, either confronting Eowyn, finding ways to deal with the medallion, or taking leadership when Talon falters, to make her a more dynamic character.

These adjustments should help maintain narrative tension, avoid repetitive conflicts, and add more depth to both the internal and external struggles in these chapters.
