Here’s what doesn’t work or could be improved for **Chapters 21–23**:

### Chapter 21: Aftermath of Betrayal
1. **Talon’s Collapse Feels Overdone**: Talon’s mental collapse has been extensively covered in previous chapters, and revisiting it here risks feeling repetitive. While it’s important to show his continued struggle, this chapter might benefit from a fresh angle. Perhaps there could be a moment of brief clarity, even if temporary, that adds complexity to his emotional state, rather than just reinforcing his collapse.
2. **Sari’s Leadership Feels Too Sudden**: Sari stepping into a leadership role is a good development, but it feels abrupt. Her transition could benefit from more inner conflict—showing her doubts or fears about leading—rather than simply having her take on the role without resistance. This would add more emotional depth to her character and the group dynamics.
3. **Lack of Distinct Action**: The group’s disarray and Talon’s withdrawal are important, but the chapter risks feeling stagnant if there’s no forward momentum. Consider adding a concrete action or decision from one of the characters that propels the group into the next phase, even if they are emotionally devastated.

### Chapter 22: The Vision Quest Begins
1. **Vision Quest Setup Feels Rushed**: Talon’s transition into the vision quest feels sudden. There’s an opportunity here to build more tension before he’s fully drawn in. Perhaps his resistance to the Veil should increase before the inevitable pull happens. This could heighten the stakes and make his surrender to the vision quest feel more impactful.
2. **Alien World is Underdeveloped**: The alien landscape Talon enters during the vision quest could be more fully realized. Right now, it serves as a backdrop for his internal struggles, but giving more detail and significance to this world would deepen the immersion. What makes this landscape particularly haunting or strange? Is there something about it that connects to the Veil’s origins?
3. **Lack of Tangible Consequences**: Talon’s guilt and inner demons are well-established, but the vision quest risks feeling too internal if it doesn’t have clear, external consequences. Consider weaving in how his struggles with the Veil are impacting the real world, heightening the tension as the group tries to save him. This could add more stakes to his psychological journey.

### Chapter 23: The Breaking Point
1. **Pacing Could Be Tightened**: The chapter spends a lot of time focusing on Talon’s internal breakdown, and while this is crucial, it may slow the pacing. To maintain reader engagement, consider interspersing more dynamic moments with Talon’s internal torment—whether through sharp, jarring visions or brief encounters with figures from his past. This would create a sense of urgency within the slow descent.
2. **Visions of Death Repetition**: Talon’s visions of his own death are powerful, but they risk becoming repetitive if there’s no variation. Each vision should feel distinct and escalate in intensity, so they don’t blend together. Perhaps one vision could involve a loved one’s betrayal or a completely unexpected form of death to shock Talon and the reader.
3. **Sari and Griffin Are Too Absent**: While the focus is understandably on Talon, Sari and Griffin’s absence weakens the chapter’s emotional depth. Even if they aren’t physically present, finding ways to include their emotional impact on Talon (through hallucinations, memories, or their voices) would keep their influence on him alive during his descent.

### Overall Issues:
- **Talon’s Collapse Feels Prolonged**: His mental breakdown has been explored across several chapters, and continuing to emphasize his hopelessness risks exhausting the reader. Shifting the focus to his gradual empowerment or offering moments of insight could add more dimension to his journey.
- **Lack of Real-World Stakes**: While the vision quest is essential for Talon’s development, the disconnect from the real world might reduce tension. Consider tying his vision quest more explicitly to what’s happening in reality, adding real stakes to his mental journey.
- **Sari’s Character Arc Needs More Exploration**: Sari’s role is reactive at this point, and her stepping into leadership could be more nuanced. Adding moments where she doubts herself or confronts internal demons would make her arc feel more developed.

These adjustments would help improve pacing, add emotional depth, and prevent repetition, while keeping the narrative engaging and forward-moving.
