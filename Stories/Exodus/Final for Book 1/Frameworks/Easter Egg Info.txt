To subtly hint that readers should be looking for an **easter egg** and **cipher** without making it too obvious, we can use a few strategic methods woven throughout the narrative. Here’s how we could do it:

### **1. Visionary Hints Through Talon**:
Talon’s visions can include cryptic imagery that feels **just off enough** to make readers think there’s a deeper meaning behind them. These visions could include **patterns** or **phrases** that don’t fully make sense in the moment but could later be pieced together to form part of the cipher.

- **Example**: 
  In Chapter 24, while Talon is undergoing his vision quest, he could see a repeating symbol or hear a phrase like, “The key is hidden beneath the light.” The repetition and **vagueness** of the phrase make it stand out but don’t immediately scream “cipher.”

### **2. Omnis’s Unusual Speech Patterns**:
Omnis, as the **android embodiment of Metis**, already has socially odd behavior. Some of her dialogue could sound **unintentionally cryptic**, with phrases that feel **detached** or **out of sync** with the rest of the conversation. Readers will notice this, but it won’t be obvious right away that it’s part of a bigger puzzle.

- **Example**: 
  In a key conversation in **Chapter 27**, Omnis could drop a line like, “Light bends, but words do not. What is hidden will stay hidden until sought.” The cryptic nature of this line might prompt readers to look deeper, but it also fits within Omnis’s strange, analytical way of thinking.

### **3. A Book Within the Book**:
If one of the characters stumbles upon a **journal or artifact** that contains ancient **Mayan** or **alien writings**, this could serve as a direct nudge toward the cipher without being too on the nose. These writings could contain **symbols or numbers** that seem irrelevant at first but are later revealed to be crucial pieces of the puzzle.

- **Example**: 
  In **Chapter 30**, when Talon experiences his final vision, he could briefly encounter the remnants of an alien civilization's **written language**. The vision could focus on specific symbols without fully explaining their meaning, giving readers clues that this is something they should be paying attention to.

### **4. Breaking the Fourth Wall (Subtlety Required)**:
Without breaking immersion, you could include **small authorial nudges** within the narrative—subtle lines that suggest to readers that the **puzzle exists**.

- **Example**: 
  Talon or Sari could have a fleeting thought like, “Everything felt just slightly out of place, as if the world itself was hiding a deeper truth—something just beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.”

### **Next Steps**:
- Would you like to **integrate these moments** throughout the story now, or should we focus on building the cipher and then place it strategically in specific sections later?
- We can also brainstorm how to **structure the cipher** so that the **final hidden message** gives readers something surprising but satisfying.
