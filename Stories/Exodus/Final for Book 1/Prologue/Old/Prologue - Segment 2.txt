**Prologue: Fractured Visions**

**Aftermath and Physical Marking**

The silence in the forest was almost worse than the battle itself. Talon stood motionless, the medallion still throbbing faintly against his chest, though its pull had lessened. The fog clung to the trees, obscuring the world around them like a veil, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were still being watched—by something darker, something older than the creatures they had just faced.

His hand trembled as he looked down at his arm. **The glyphs**—those strange, alien symbols etched into the surface of the medallion—had transferred onto his skin. They pulsed with a dim light, faint but unmistakable. Every pulse sent a small wave of pain shooting up his arm, as though the medallion had seared its mark into his very being.

Griffin approached him, his eyes cold, though his breath came in short, angry bursts. The battle had taken its toll, but his focus was on Talon now. Always on Talon. “You almost got us killed,” he said, his voice low but filled with fury.

Talon’s head snapped up. “I didn’t—”

“You did,” Griffin interrupted, stepping closer, towering over Talon. “You were going to use it again. I saw the look in your eyes. You can’t control it.” His voice was tight, strained, as though he was holding back the urge to lash out.

“I was trying to help,” Talon shot back, though his voice lacked conviction. He could still feel the medallion’s influence, like a presence in the back of his mind, whispering that Griffin was wrong. He could control it. He just needed more time.

“Help?” Griffin spat the word like it was poison. “You were about to let that thing take over again. What happens next time? What happens when it turns you against us? What happens when it decides that we’re in its way?”

Talon clenched his fists, the burning in his skin intensifying. “I’m not—”

“You are!” Griffin’s face was flushed now, his anger barely restrained. “Every time you use that medallion, you get closer to becoming one of those things we’re fighting.”

The words hit Talon harder than any of the blows he’d taken during the battle. He wanted to argue, to tell Griffin he was wrong, but deep down, a small part of him wondered if he was right. He could still feel the medallion’s power coursing through him, the rush of euphoria when he’d tapped into it. But the pain that followed—the searing of the glyphs into his skin—was a stark reminder that power came at a price.

Sari stepped between them, her presence a calming force, though even she looked shaken. Her normally steady hands trembled slightly as she glanced at the glowing marks on Talon’s skin. “We need to focus,” she said quietly, her eyes shifting between Talon and Griffin. “We barely survived that, and there’s no guarantee there won’t be more.”

Her voice, though soft, carried the weight of authority. Griffin stepped back, his jaw clenched, but the fire in his eyes remained.

Sari turned her attention to Talon, her expression softening with concern. “Are you… okay?” she asked, though her eyes lingered on the **burning glyphs** now etched into his skin.

Talon wanted to lie, to say that everything was fine, that he was in control. But the words wouldn’t come. Instead, he looked away, unable to meet her gaze. “I don’t know,” he muttered, his voice barely audible. The pain in his arm had dulled to a throb, but the weight of the medallion around his neck felt heavier than ever.

Sari nodded, understanding without pressing further. “We’ll figure it out,” she said, though there was a tremor in her voice that betrayed her uncertainty.

Griffin’s voice cut through again, harsher this time. “If we survive long enough.” He glared at Talon one last time before stalking off, his hand still gripping the hilt of his sword as if expecting another ambush at any moment.

Talon stood in silence, staring at the spot where Griffin had disappeared into the fog. The weight of his words lingered, heavy and suffocating. He glanced down at the medallion, its glow dim now, but the glyphs remained on his skin—**permanent**, a reminder of the power that flowed through it. Power that he couldn’t deny. 

Sari placed a hand on his shoulder, but he barely felt it. His thoughts were already drifting, consumed by the same question that had been gnawing at him since he first found the medallion.

What was it turning him into?
