### **Prologue: Dream of the Veil**

The forest was a shifting maze of shadows and fog, its twisted trees bending unnaturally under the weight of an unseen force. Talon’s breath came in sharp, uneven bursts as he ran, the medallion around his neck growing heavier with each passing second. He could feel the dark energy pulsing through it, a rhythm that matched his own rapid heartbeat.

“We’re surrounded,” Griffin growled, his sword already drawn. The blade gleamed in the faint light filtering through the dense canopy, its surface etched with ancient runes that flared with a faint, iridescent glow. The weight of responsibility pressed heavily on him as he scanned the mist for the telltale shimmer of the Eidolons.

Sari’s twin blades flashed in her hands as she took her position beside him. Her movements were graceful and deliberate, every step calculated. The air was thick with tension, the kind that precedes a storm. The fog seemed to shift around them, alive with the presence of their enemies.

And then, they attacked.

The Eidolons moved like smoke—dark, shadowy forms that twisted and blurred as they lunged from the treeline. Their claws glinted in the faint light, and the air grew colder with their approach. Griffin’s sword met the first one mid-lunge, cutting through the creature with a hiss. The runes on his blade flared brightly, and for a brief moment, the shadow dissipated.

“Talon!” Sari’s voice snapped through the chaos, but Talon barely heard her. His hand instinctively went to the medallion at his chest, feeling its cold weight against his skin. His vision blurred, and the sounds of the fight seemed to grow distant, muffled as though he were sinking into water.

The forest around him faded, replaced by crumbling stone walls and a vast, desolate landscape. **Talon was no longer in the forest**. He stood in the ruins of an ancient temple, the walls cracked and worn by time. Above him, the sky was torn open, the **Veil** itself visible, a swirling mass of darkness and light. It stretched across the sky like a living thing, its tendrils reaching down toward the earth, warping everything it touched.

He could hear whispers—faint, disembodied voices that echoed through the ruins. They spoke of the **Veil’s power**, of the way it had once been controlled, and how it had slipped beyond humanity’s grasp. Talon’s chest tightened as the medallion pulsed in time with the whispers, the weight of his family’s legacy pressing down on him. He wasn’t just a bearer of the medallion—he was part of its history, tied to the Veil by blood.

The vision flickered, and Talon’s heart raced. The **battle raged on** in the distance, but it felt far away. The temple walls blurred, and for a moment, Talon thought he saw a figure—a man, standing at the altar at the center of the temple. The man’s hands were raised, and the medallion, identical to Talon’s, glowed brightly in his grasp.

But then, just as quickly as it had come, the vision dissolved.

“Talon, focus!” Griffin’s shout cut through the haze, and Talon blinked, suddenly back in the forest. The world snapped back into harsh clarity—Sari and Griffin were fighting for their lives, their weapons flashing as they struck at the shadowy forms of the Eidolons. 

Griffin’s sword cleaved through another Eidolon, the runes along its blade glowing brighter with each strike. Talon stumbled forward, his hand still clutching the medallion, but the pull of the visions was too strong. He could feel the medallion’s power, cold and relentless, pulling him back into the dream-like state.

Another Eidolon lunged at Sari, its claws slashing through the air. She dodged gracefully, her twin blades cutting through the creature in a fluid motion, but her eyes flicked toward Talon, concern etched on her face.

“Talon, snap out of it!” she called, her voice tight with urgency. 

But Talon couldn’t shake the medallion’s hold. His vision blurred once more, the edges of the forest fading into darkness as the familiar weight of the medallion dragged him deeper.

This time, the **vision was stronger**. The temple reappeared, more vivid than before. The figure at the altar stood still, but now Talon could make out more details. The man wore robes of a deep, rich color, his hands trembling as he held the medallion. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, as though they were urging Talon to understand. This man—this ancestor of his—had made a choice, binding their bloodline to the medallion and the Veil’s power.

The vision flickered, and Talon caught a glimpse of something else—a vast, looming figure in the distance. **Metis**. It stood at the edge of the battlefield, its presence suffocating. Talon couldn’t make out its form entirely, but its eyes—cold, calculating—seemed to pierce through him, as though Metis was aware of him, watching his every move.

Suddenly, Talon was yanked out of the vision, the medallion’s pull weakening just enough for him to hear the battle around him again. He gasped, stumbling as he tried to regain his bearings. The **forest was alive with shadows**, the Eidolons still pressing in from all sides.

Griffin swung his sword in a wide arc, slicing through another Eidolon, but the fight was taking its toll. His breathing was heavy, and a thin line of blood trickled from a cut on his forehead. Sari moved like a shadow herself, her blades flashing as she struck down another creature, but the **Eidolons kept coming**.

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, and the medallion thrummed with power. The visions had shown him something—something important. But there was no time to dwell on it. Not now.

He had to focus.

Forcing himself back into the present, Talon raised his hands, feeling the familiar weight of the medallion as it pressed against his chest. The forest was closing in, the fight growing more desperate with each passing second.

The fog thickened around them, swirling like a living thing, and the dark shapes of the Eidolons moved within it, quick and relentless. Talon’s heart raced, but he forced his mind to stay present. The pull of the medallion hadn’t fully let go, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he was dragged back into the visions.

Griffin stumbled to his feet after blocking another strike from an Eidolon, his sword flashing as it cut through the creature’s shadowy form. The ancient runes along the blade flared brightly, pulsing with each hit. His face was tense, sweat beading on his brow as he fought with precision, but Talon could see the strain. Griffin’s sword, while powerful, wasn’t enough to hold back the tide forever.

Sari darted past him, her twin blades gleaming as they sliced through the fog, severing an Eidolon that had gotten too close. Her movements were fluid, like a dancer weaving between the creatures. But even she couldn’t hide the strain of the battle; her breath came quick and sharp.

Talon felt his feet moving again, trying to follow their lead, but the medallion tugged at his mind, pulling him into another flicker of a vision. For a brief moment, he was back in the ancient hall, the sky torn open by the Veil. The temple stood in ruins, and his ancestor’s figure at the altar was clear now. The man’s face was gaunt, hollow, as though the weight of the medallion had consumed him. The whispers grew louder, pressing into Talon’s mind, but before he could grasp their meaning, the vision dissolved again.

He blinked, disoriented, back in the chaos of the forest. Griffin’s voice cut through the din.

“Watch out!”

Talon spun just in time to see an Eidolon lunging toward him. Its twisted form seemed more solid now, its claws aimed directly for his chest. Instinctively, Talon threw up his arms, but the impact sent him crashing to the ground. Pain flared through his shoulder as he hit the dirt, and the medallion pulsed sharply against his chest, sending a wave of heat through his body.

“Talon!” Sari’s voice was distant, strained as she fended off two more Eidolons that circled her like vultures. Her blades flashed as she cut through one, but she was barely keeping them at bay.

Griffin moved toward him, but another Eidolon intercepted, slashing at him with a speed Talon hadn’t seen before. Griffin raised his sword just in time to block the strike, but the force of the blow knocked him off balance, and he stumbled, his foot catching on a thick root beneath the fog. He cursed under his breath, trying to steady himself, but the damage was done—his ankle twisted with a sickening snap, and Griffin let out a grunt of pain as he collapsed to one knee.

Talon scrambled to his feet, his mind racing. He had to do something. He reached for the medallion again, feeling its cold surface against his skin. The power within it stirred, responding to his touch, but the visions threatened to overwhelm him again. He couldn’t let that happen—not with Griffin hurt and Sari surrounded.

The forest around them seemed to close in tighter, the fog wrapping around them like a noose. The air was thick, suffocating, and the shadows of the Eidolons moved with renewed purpose, as though sensing the group’s weakness. The creatures were relentless, their forms shifting and stretching as they advanced.

“We need to move!” Griffin shouted, his voice rough with pain. He struggled to rise, his sword still in hand, but his injured ankle made it impossible to stand. “We can’t hold them off here.”

Talon nodded, his mind scrambling for a plan. They couldn’t stay here—the Eidolons would tear them apart. But with Griffin unable to walk and Sari fending off the creatures, they had few options. His gaze flicked toward the forest beyond the immediate battle, searching for something—anything—that could offer them a chance to escape.

And then he saw it.

Just beyond the next line of trees, barely visible through the fog, there was a faint shimmer of water. A stream, cutting through the forest, its surface rippling with the swift current. It wasn’t deep, but it could offer them a momentary advantage, a chance to slow the Eidolons down.

“There!” Talon shouted, pointing toward the stream. “We can cross it! The water might slow them down.”

Sari glanced over her shoulder, her eyes widening as she saw the stream. Without hesitation, she slashed through the last of the Eidolons in her immediate path and darted toward Griffin, grabbing his arm to help him up.

“We’re going,” she said firmly, her voice leaving no room for argument.

Griffin grunted in pain but nodded, leaning heavily on Sari as she helped him limp toward the stream. Talon followed, his breath coming in sharp bursts as he fought the urge to look back at the approaching shadows. The medallion pulsed against his chest, and he could feel the visions clawing at the edges of his mind, but he forced them down. Not now. He couldn’t afford to lose himself again.

The stream was cold and fast, the water rushing over jagged rocks, but it wasn’t deep. Sari moved quickly, leaping from one stone to another, still supporting Griffin as they made their way across. Talon followed, his boots slipping on the slick rocks as he fought to keep his balance. His muscles ached from the exertion, and the weight of the medallion seemed heavier than ever, but they were moving—moving away from the Eidolons.

Behind them, the shadows hesitated at the edge of the stream, their forms flickering in the fog. For a brief moment, it seemed as though the creatures couldn’t cross the water, their shapes blurring as they hovered at the bank. But Talon knew it wouldn’t last. The medallion’s pull was too strong, and the Eidolons were drawn to its power. It was only a matter of time before they found a way across.

“We need to keep moving,” Griffin gasped, his face pale with pain as he leaned heavily on Sari. His ankle was swollen, and every step seemed to send a jolt of agony through him, but he pushed forward.

Talon nodded, his eyes scanning the forest ahead. The trees were thicker here, their gnarled branches stretching out like claws, but they offered some cover. The stream had bought them time, but not much. The Eidolons would come, and when they did, they would be stronger.

As they moved deeper into the forest, Talon could feel the medallion pulsing again, the visions pressing harder against his mind. He couldn’t hold them off much longer. Whatever the medallion was trying to show him, it wouldn’t be ignored.

But for now, they had to survive.

The forest grew darker the deeper they went, the twisted trees forming a canopy so thick that even the faintest light struggled to break through. The air was thick with moisture, and the fog seemed to cling to their skin, heavy and suffocating. Talon’s mind was foggy too, as though the medallion’s pull had woven itself into the very fabric of the forest around them.

Griffin’s breathing was labored, and his steps were uneven, but he pressed on, one arm draped over Sari’s shoulder as she helped him move. Sari kept her pace steady, her eyes scanning the forest for any sign of movement, her blades still drawn, ready for whatever might come next. Talon followed behind, struggling to push back the visions that tugged at him with every step.

They reached a small clearing, the ground uneven and littered with jagged rocks. The stream they had crossed was now just a faint murmur in the distance, but the shadows of the Eidolons still pressed on the edges of Talon’s awareness. They weren’t far behind. They never were.

“We can stop for a moment,” Sari said, her voice strained from supporting Griffin’s weight. “But not long. They’re still out there.”

Griffin nodded, lowering himself onto a fallen log with a grimace. His ankle was swollen, and his face was pale, but he refused to show how much pain he was in. He wiped the sweat from his brow and glanced at Talon, his eyes narrowing.

“How much longer are you going to let that thing mess with your head, Talon?” Griffin asked, his voice sharper than before. “Every time you zone out, we’re the ones who have to clean up the mess.”

Talon opened his mouth to respond, but the words stuck in his throat. He couldn’t deny the truth. The medallion’s pull was growing stronger, and with every vision, it became harder to return to reality. But he couldn’t explain it to Griffin—couldn’t make him understand that it wasn’t just a distraction. The medallion was trying to show him something, something important, but the weight of it was overwhelming.

Sari glanced between the two of them, her expression tight with worry. “Griffin, don’t push him. We’re all dealing with enough as it is.”

Griffin scoffed but didn’t argue. He leaned back, his hand resting on his sword, the blade still glowing faintly from the runes etched into its surface. Talon’s eyes lingered on the sword for a moment—it was a powerful weapon, one that had saved them more than once. But even Griffin’s sword couldn’t protect them from everything. 

Talon felt the familiar thrum of the medallion against his chest, and before he could brace himself, the world around him shifted.

The clearing dissolved into darkness, the twisted trees replaced by towering stone pillars that stretched toward a shattered sky. The ground beneath Talon’s feet was cracked and dry, as though life itself had been drained from it. He was back in the ancient temple, but this time, the vision was sharper, more vivid. The whispers were louder, their voices overlapping, pressing into his mind with a sense of urgency.

In the center of the temple stood the same figure he had seen before—the man who bore the medallion before him, his ancestor. The man’s face was gaunt, his eyes hollow, as though the medallion had drained the life from him. He stood before an altar, the medallion glowing brightly in his hands, and Talon felt a shiver of recognition. This was the moment—**the moment his family had been bound to the Veil**.

The whispers grew louder, and Talon stepped forward, drawn to the altar despite the fear that gnawed at his chest. The air around him felt thick, heavy with the weight of the Veil’s power. He could feel its presence, a vast and ancient force, pressing against the edges of his mind, testing him.

And then he saw it—**Metis**. The towering figure loomed over the battlefield, its form dark and shifting, its eyes cold and calculating. It stood at the edge of the temple, watching as the man at the altar completed the ritual. Metis didn’t move, but Talon could feel its gaze piercing through him, as though it was aware of his presence, even in the vision.

“You are bound to it,” a voice whispered, and Talon turned to see the figure at the altar staring directly at him. “You cannot escape the Veil’s pull. You never could.”

Talon’s heart raced as the medallion pulsed violently against his chest, the heat of the glyphs burning through his skin. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and Talon felt the ground beneath him tremble.

The vision blurred, and the temple began to crumble. The pillars cracked and fell, the ground split open, and the Veil itself seemed to pulse with an unnatural light, swallowing everything in its path.

Talon gasped as he was ripped back to the present, his body trembling from the force of the vision. He collapsed to his knees, his hand clutching the medallion as though it was the only thing keeping him grounded.

“Talon!” Sari was beside him in an instant, her hand on his shoulder. “Are you okay? What did you see?”

Talon shook his head, unable to speak. The weight of the vision still pressed heavily on him, the image of Metis and the crumbling temple etched into his mind. The whispers had warned him—he was bound to the Veil, just as his ancestor had been. And now, he was part of something far greater, something far more dangerous than he had ever imagined.

“We need to go,” Griffin said, pushing himself to his feet despite the pain in his ankle. “They’re coming. We can’t stay here.”

Sari helped Talon to his feet, her eyes filled with concern. “We’ll figure this out later,” she said softly, though the uncertainty in her voice was clear. “Right now, we need to survive.”

Talon nodded, though his thoughts were still clouded by the weight of the vision. The forest seemed darker now, the fog thicker, and the shadows of the Eidolons pressed in on them once more. They had bought themselves time, but not much. The medallion pulsed again, a constant reminder of the power he carried, and the burden it placed on them all.

Together, the trio moved deeper into the forest, the whispers of the Veil still echoing in Talon’s mind.
