**Prologue: Fractured Visions**

**Talon’s Rationalization and First Vision**

The campfire crackled weakly as night fell, its dim light flickering against the oppressive fog that clung to the ground. Talon sat apart from the others, his back against a twisted, rotting tree. The medallion weighed heavy against his chest, as though it had grown heavier with each passing hour. He could feel the glyphs on his skin still glowing faintly beneath his sleeve, a constant reminder of what he had unleashed.

Across from him, Griffin sat sharpening his sword, his eyes never straying far from Talon. The unspoken tension between them hung thick in the air, and Talon could almost feel Griffin’s suspicion, gnawing at him like a physical presence. 

Sari rested nearby, her eyes closed but her breathing uneven. She wasn’t asleep—none of them could sleep here. Not with the weight of the Veil pressing down on them, not with the medallion pulsing in the dark like a heartbeat only Talon could feel.

He couldn’t stop thinking about the power he’d felt during the ambush. The moment of clarity when everything had slowed, when he had felt like he could bend reality to his will. He’d been afraid at first—afraid of what the medallion might do to him, afraid of what he might become. But the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. The power wasn’t a curse. 

What if it was his destiny?

Talon shifted uncomfortably, staring into the fire as his thoughts churned. He was starting to see it more clearly now. Griffin didn’t understand the medallion. Sari, despite her kindness, didn’t understand it either. They were afraid of it, but what if the medallion wasn’t something to fear? What if it was something meant for him?

The Veil wasn’t just some chaotic force—it was something ancient, something powerful, and it had chosen him. He could feel it deep in his bones, in the way the glyphs burned when he tapped into the medallion’s power. Maybe that wasn’t a bad thing. Maybe it was showing him what he could become, what he was supposed to become.

As his thoughts spiraled, Talon felt the world around him start to blur again. The firelight flickered, distorting, and the edges of his vision seemed to stretch unnaturally. He blinked, trying to shake off the feeling, but it clung to him, pulling him deeper.

And then, without warning, the world around him vanished.

Talon stood in a desolate wasteland, the ground cracked and dry beneath his feet. The sky above was a sickly green, swirling with dark clouds that moved too fast, as though time here didn’t flow the way it should. Massive, crumbling monoliths towered over him, their surfaces etched with glyphs that shifted and pulsed with a dull, eerie light. They looked like the ones on his skin—familiar, yet foreign.

He tried to move, but his legs felt heavy, rooted to the spot. Whispers filled the air, faint at first, but growing louder with each passing moment. They spoke in a language he couldn’t understand, but the meaning felt clear: they were calling to him. Urging him forward.

Talon’s chest tightened as he felt the familiar pull of the medallion, its power thrumming through him. The glyphs on his skin burned brighter, matching the light of the monoliths. His hand reached out toward them, though he wasn’t sure why. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and with every step he took, the power surged, filling him with a sense of purpose.

This was it. This was the Veil’s power—his power.

As he neared one of the monoliths, his hand brushed against its surface, and a shock of energy shot through him. The whispers became deafening, and the world around him twisted, bending and contorting as if reality itself was being pulled apart.

And then, just as quickly as it began, the vision shattered.

Talon gasped, his eyes snapping open, heart racing in his chest. He was back at the camp, the fire still burning weakly beside him. His hands trembled as he clutched the medallion, the cold metal biting into his palm.

“Talon.” Griffin’s voice was low, his gaze sharp. “What’s wrong?”

Talon forced himself to breathe, pushing down the lingering sense of unease. He couldn’t tell Griffin—not now. He wasn’t sure what he had just seen, but he knew one thing for certain: the medallion had shown him something. Something important. Something he needed to understand.

“Nothing,” Talon muttered, his voice unsteady. “I’m fine.”

Griffin didn’t look convinced, but he didn’t press further. Talon’s gaze shifted to Sari, who was watching him now, her eyes filled with concern. She had always been the one to try and understand him, but even she couldn’t know what he was feeling. She couldn’t understand the weight of the medallion, the power it offered.

Talon sat back, staring up at the sky. The whispers from the vision still echoed faintly in his mind, and though he didn’t fully understand what they meant, he knew one thing.

The medallion wasn’t just power.

It was a door.

And it was opening.
