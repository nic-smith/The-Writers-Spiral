**Prologue: Fractured Visions**

**The Ambush**

The forest reeked of death and decay, its branches sagging under the weight of their own rot. Talon pushed forward, every step through the muck dragging at his legs like invisible hands from below. The air was thick, suffocating with an ancient, oppressive weight—more than just the fog that clung to the ground. It felt alive. 

And something was hunting them.

“Stay sharp!” Griffin’s voice pierced the dense silence, cutting through the foreboding atmosphere. His hand rested on the hilt of his sword, his eyes scanning the twisted trees as he led the group forward. Sari moved silently behind him, her steps as light as her breath, and Talon followed, his heart pounding against his ribs.

Talon felt it before he saw anything. The medallion pressed against his chest pulsed, sending a cold shiver up his spine. His vision blurred, and for a moment, it seemed like the world around him shifted—the trees twisted unnaturally, their shadows stretching and bending in ways that defied logic.

The medallion was reacting to something.

“Talon, focus!” Griffin’s growl broke through the fog, his eyes narrowing. He had never trusted the medallion—never trusted what it did to Talon. His gaze lingered on it, filled with disdain.

Talon’s hand instinctively went to the medallion hanging from his neck. It thrummed beneath his touch, vibrating with a low, chilling energy. Something about it called to him, like an old memory just out of reach, like it was trying to guide him, but toward what?

The shadows around them shifted.

From the depths of the fog, they appeared—**Eidolons**. Dark, twisted figures, their bodies nothing more than swirling shadows with sharp, gleaming claws. They moved as though reality bent to their will, shifting in and out of focus, blurring with each step they took toward the group.

Talon's pulse quickened. His mind screamed at him to run, but his body felt frozen. 

Griffin, always the first to act, unsheathed his sword with a metallic hiss. “Get ready!”

The Eidolons lunged.

Talon staggered back, his hands shaking as the creatures closed in on them. The medallion grew colder, and before he could think, he grasped it.

**Power** surged through him, a wave of raw energy that electrified his veins. The world seemed to pause for a heartbeat, and in that moment, Talon felt weightless, like time itself had halted around him. His skin burned as the glyphs on the medallion flared to life, searing into his flesh. 

For the first time in what felt like ages, everything became clear. 

He could control it.

His eyes glowed an eerie white, casting a faint light through the mist as he raised a trembling hand. The nearest Eidolon froze mid-lunge, its form twisting and writhing in the air before it dissolved into dust, scattered by the wind. 

Talon stood transfixed, his body buzzing with the thrill of power coursing through him.

“Talon!” Griffin’s voice snapped him back to the present. Time lurched forward once more, and the remaining Eidolons surged toward them with renewed fury.

Griffin was already in motion, his sword cutting through the shadows with practiced precision. Sari moved like a whisper, her daggers flashing as she danced between the creatures, but there were too many. 

Talon’s hand tightened around the medallion. He could stop this. All he had to do was let the power flow through him again.

“No!” Sari’s voice rang out as she spun to slash at an approaching Eidolon. She locked eyes with Talon, her expression filled with both fear and determination. “Don’t use it again!”

He hesitated, the medallion pulsing beneath his fingers, urging him to unleash it once more.

But the fight was still raging. He could end this now.

With a desperate yell, Talon released the medallion and watched as Griffin and Sari fought off the remaining Eidolons, their strikes swift but desperate. The creatures fought back with relentless force, but one by one, they fell—dissolving into the fog from which they had come.

And then, silence.
