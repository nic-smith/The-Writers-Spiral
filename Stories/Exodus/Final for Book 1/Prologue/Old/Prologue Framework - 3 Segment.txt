- **Purpose**: Begin exploring the **emotional consequences** of Talon’s use of the medallion and the physical toll it takes on him. Introduce Griffin’s **growing distrust** of Talon.
- **Tone**: Slightly slower, more focused on **psychological unease**. The environment feels oppressive, and Talon starts to question the medallion’s hold over him.
- **Key Events**:

  - Griffin confronts Talon about the medallion, accusing him of being a danger to the group. Tension rises as **Griffin’s mistrust** becomes more explicit.

### **Segment 3: Talon’s Rationalization and First Vision**

- **Purpose**: Show Talon’s growing **internal conflict** as he begins to rationalize his connection to the medallion. His first full **hallucination** pulls him deeper into the Veil’s power, setting up the emotional and psychological stakes for the story.
- **Tone**: More introspective, with a shift toward **creeping dread** as Talon’s visions intensify. The atmosphere should feel increasingly surreal and unsettling.
- **Key Events**:
  - As the group rests, Talon begins to rationalize that the **medallion may be his destiny**. He wonders if he’s meant to control this power, not just fear it.
  - Talon has his first **full-blown vision**—he sees an ancient, crumbling world filled with **alien glyphs** and ruins. The Veil reaches out to him, and he hears whispers in an ancient language.
  - He snaps out of the vision, disoriented and disturbed. Griffin notices something is wrong but doesn’t confront Talon directly. The prologue ends on a note of **unease**, as Talon questions what the Veil truly wants from him.
