Prologue: Fractured Visions

[The Ambush]

The forest reeked of death and decay, its branches sagging under the weight of their own rot. Talon pushed forward, every step through the muck dragging at his legs like invisible hands from below. The air was thick, suffocating with an ancient, oppressive weight—more than just the fog that clung to the ground. It felt alive. 

And something was hunting them.

“Stay sharp!” Griffin’s voice pierced the dense silence, cutting through the foreboding atmosphere. His hand rested on the hilt of his sword, his eyes scanning the twisted trees as he led the group forward. Sari moved silently behind him, her steps as light as her breath, and Talon followed, his heart pounding against his ribs.

Talon felt it before he saw anything. The medallion pressed against his chest pulsed, sending a cold shiver up his spine. His vision blurred, and for a moment, it seemed like the world around him shifted—the trees twisted unnaturally, their shadows stretching and bending in ways that defied logic.

The medallion was reacting to something.

“Talon, focus!” Griffin’s growl broke through the fog, his eyes narrowing. He had never trusted the medallion—never trusted what it did to Talon. His gaze lingered on it, filled with disdain.

Talon’s hand instinctively went to the medallion hanging from his neck. It thrummed beneath his touch, vibrating with a low, chilling energy. Something about it called to him, like an old memory just out of reach, like it was trying to guide him, but toward what?

The shadows around them shifted.

From the depths of the fog, they appeared—**Eidolons**. Dark, twisted figures, their bodies nothing more than swirling shadows with sharp, gleaming claws. They moved as though reality bent to their will, shifting in and out of focus, blurring with each step they took toward the group.

Talon's pulse quickened. His mind screamed at him to run, but his body felt frozen. 

Griffin, always the first to act, unsheathed his sword with a metallic hiss. “Get ready!”

The Eidolons lunged.

Talon staggered back, his hands shaking as the creatures closed in on them. The medallion grew colder, and before he could think, he grasped it.

**Power** surged through him, a wave of raw energy that electrified his veins. The world seemed to pause for a heartbeat, and in that moment, Talon felt weightless, like time itself had halted around him. His skin burned as the glyphs on the medallion flared to life, searing into his flesh. 

For the first time in what felt like ages, everything became clear. 

He could control it.

His eyes glowed an eerie white, casting a faint light through the mist as he raised a trembling hand. The nearest Eidolon froze mid-lunge, its form twisting and writhing in the air before it dissolved into dust, scattered by the wind. 

Talon stood transfixed, his body buzzing with the thrill of power coursing through him.

“Talon!” Griffin’s voice snapped him back to the present. Time lurched forward once more, and the remaining Eidolons surged toward them with renewed fury.

Griffin was already in motion, his sword cutting through the shadows with practiced precision. Sari moved like a whisper, her daggers flashing as she danced between the creatures, but there were too many. 

Talon’s hand tightened around the medallion. He could stop this. All he had to do was let the power flow through him again.

“No!” Sari’s voice rang out as she spun to slash at an approaching Eidolon. She locked eyes with Talon, her expression filled with both fear and determination. “Don’t use it again!”

He hesitated, the medallion pulsing beneath his fingers, urging him to unleash it once more.

But the fight was still raging. He could end this now.

With a desperate yell, Talon released the medallion and watched as Griffin and Sari fought off the remaining Eidolons, their strikes swift but desperate. The creatures fought back with relentless force, but one by one, they fell—dissolving into the fog from which they had come.

And then, silence.

[Aftermath and Physical Marking]

The silence in the forest was almost worse than the battle itself. Talon stood motionless, the medallion still throbbing faintly against his chest, though its pull had lessened. The fog clung to the trees, obscuring the world around them like a veil, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were still being watched—by something darker, something older than the creatures they had just faced.

His hand trembled as he looked down at his arm. **The glyphs**—those strange, alien symbols etched into the surface of the medallion—had transferred onto his skin. They pulsed with a dim light, faint but unmistakable. Every pulse sent a small wave of pain shooting up his arm, as though the medallion had seared its mark into his very being.

Griffin approached him, his eyes cold, though his breath came in short, angry bursts. The battle had taken its toll, but his focus was on Talon now. Always on Talon. “You almost got us killed,” he said, his voice low but filled with fury.

Talon’s head snapped up. “I didn’t—”

“You did,” Griffin interrupted, stepping closer, towering over Talon. “You were going to use it again. I saw the look in your eyes. You can’t control it.” His voice was tight, strained, as though he was holding back the urge to lash out.

“I was trying to help,” Talon shot back, though his voice lacked conviction. He could still feel the medallion’s influence, like a presence in the back of his mind, whispering that Griffin was wrong. He could control it. He just needed more time.

“Help?” Griffin spat the word like it was poison. “You were about to let that thing take over again. What happens next time? What happens when it turns you against us? What happens when it decides that we’re in its way?”

Talon clenched his fists, the burning in his skin intensifying. “I’m not—”

“You are!” Griffin’s face was flushed now, his anger barely restrained. “Every time you use that medallion, you get closer to becoming one of those things we’re fighting.”

The words hit Talon harder than any of the blows he’d taken during the battle. He wanted to argue, to tell Griffin he was wrong, but deep down, a small part of him wondered if he was right. He could still feel the medallion’s power coursing through him, the rush of euphoria when he’d tapped into it. But the pain that followed—the searing of the glyphs into his skin—was a stark reminder that power came at a price.

Sari stepped between them, her presence a calming force, though even she looked shaken. Her normally steady hands trembled slightly as she glanced at the glowing marks on Talon’s skin. “We need to focus,” she said quietly, her eyes shifting between Talon and Griffin. “We barely survived that, and there’s no guarantee there won’t be more.”

Her voice, though soft, carried the weight of authority. Griffin stepped back, his jaw clenched, but the fire in his eyes remained.

Sari turned her attention to Talon, her expression softening with concern. “Are you… okay?” she asked, though her eyes lingered on the **burning glyphs** now etched into his skin.

Talon wanted to lie, to say that everything was fine, that he was in control. But the words wouldn’t come. Instead, he looked away, unable to meet her gaze. “I don’t know,” he muttered, his voice barely audible. The pain in his arm had dulled to a throb, but the weight of the medallion around his neck felt heavier than ever.

Sari nodded, understanding without pressing further. “We’ll figure it out,” she said, though there was a tremor in her voice that betrayed her uncertainty.

Griffin’s voice cut through again, harsher this time. “If we survive long enough.” He glared at Talon one last time before stalking off, his hand still gripping the hilt of his sword as if expecting another ambush at any moment.

Talon stood in silence, staring at the spot where Griffin had disappeared into the fog. The weight of his words lingered, heavy and suffocating. He glanced down at the medallion, its glow dim now, but the glyphs remained on his skin—**permanent**, a reminder of the power that flowed through it. Power that he couldn’t deny. 

Sari placed a hand on his shoulder, but he barely felt it. His thoughts were already drifting, consumed by the same question that had been gnawing at him since he first found the medallion.

What was it turning him into?

[Talon’s Rationalization and First Vision]

The campfire crackled weakly as night fell, its dim light flickering against the oppressive fog that clung to the ground. Talon sat apart from the others, his back against a twisted, rotting tree. The medallion weighed heavy against his chest, as though it had grown heavier with each passing hour. He could feel the glyphs on his skin still glowing faintly beneath his sleeve, a constant reminder of what he had unleashed.

Across from him, Griffin sat sharpening his sword, his eyes never straying far from Talon. The unspoken tension between them hung thick in the air, and Talon could almost feel Griffin’s suspicion, gnawing at him like a physical presence. 

Sari rested nearby, her eyes closed but her breathing uneven. She wasn’t asleep—none of them could sleep here. Not with the weight of the Veil pressing down on them, not with the medallion pulsing in the dark like a heartbeat only Talon could feel.

He couldn’t stop thinking about the power he’d felt during the ambush. The moment of clarity when everything had slowed, when he had felt like he could bend reality to his will. He’d been afraid at first—afraid of what the medallion might do to him, afraid of what he might become. But the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. The power wasn’t a curse. 

What if it was his destiny?

Talon shifted uncomfortably, staring into the fire as his thoughts churned. He was starting to see it more clearly now. Griffin didn’t understand the medallion. Sari, despite her kindness, didn’t understand it either. They were afraid of it, but what if the medallion wasn’t something to fear? What if it was something meant for him?

The Veil wasn’t just some chaotic force—it was something ancient, something powerful, and it had chosen him. He could feel it deep in his bones, in the way the glyphs burned when he tapped into the medallion’s power. Maybe that wasn’t a bad thing. Maybe it was showing him what he could become, what he was supposed to become.

As his thoughts spiraled, Talon felt the world around him start to blur again. The firelight flickered, distorting, and the edges of his vision seemed to stretch unnaturally. He blinked, trying to shake off the feeling, but it clung to him, pulling him deeper.

And then, without warning, the world around him vanished.

Talon stood in a desolate wasteland, the ground cracked and dry beneath his feet. The sky above was a sickly green, swirling with dark clouds that moved too fast, as though time here didn’t flow the way it should. Massive, crumbling monoliths towered over him, their surfaces etched with glyphs that shifted and pulsed with a dull, eerie light. They looked like the ones on his skin—familiar, yet foreign.

He tried to move, but his legs felt heavy, rooted to the spot. Whispers filled the air, faint at first, but growing louder with each passing moment. They spoke in a language he couldn’t understand, but the meaning felt clear: they were calling to him. Urging him forward.

Talon’s chest tightened as he felt the familiar pull of the medallion, its power thrumming through him. The glyphs on his skin burned brighter, matching the light of the monoliths. His hand reached out toward them, though he wasn’t sure why. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and with every step he took, the power surged, filling him with a sense of purpose.

This was it. This was the Veil’s power—his power.

As he neared one of the monoliths, his hand brushed against its surface, and a shock of energy shot through him. The whispers became deafening, and the world around him twisted, bending and contorting as if reality itself was being pulled apart.

And then, just as quickly as it began, the vision shattered.

Talon gasped, his eyes snapping open, heart racing in his chest. He was back at the camp, the fire still burning weakly beside him. His hands trembled as he clutched the medallion, the cold metal biting into his palm.

“Talon.” Griffin’s voice was low, his gaze sharp. “What’s wrong?”

Talon forced himself to breathe, pushing down the lingering sense of unease. He couldn’t tell Griffin—not now. He wasn’t sure what he had just seen, but he knew one thing for certain: the medallion had shown him something. Something important. Something he needed to understand.

“Nothing,” Talon muttered, his voice unsteady. “I’m fine.”

Griffin didn’t look convinced, but he didn’t press further. Talon’s gaze shifted to Sari, who was watching him now, her eyes filled with concern. She had always been the one to try and understand him, but even she couldn’t know what he was feeling. She couldn’t understand the weight of the medallion, the power it offered.

Talon sat back, staring up at the sky. The whispers from the vision still echoed faintly in his mind, and though he didn’t fully understand what they meant, he knew one thing.

The medallion wasn’t just power.

It was a door.

And it was opening.
