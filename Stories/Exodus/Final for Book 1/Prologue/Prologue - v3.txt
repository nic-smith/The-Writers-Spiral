**Prologue: Fractured Premonitions**

---

The air was thick with a palpable, almost electric weight. A fog hung heavy over the forest, not the natural kind but something more sentient, as if the very atmosphere was watching them. Talon felt it in his bones—the Veil’s influence, ever-present, ever-whispering. Every breath he took seemed to pull him deeper into its thrall, its tendrils winding tighter around his mind.

In the distance, **Griffin** and **Sari** were locked in combat, their forms ghostly silhouettes as they moved through the fog. Talon’s head throbbed as if a hammer was pounding against his skull. The medallion, cold against his chest, pulsed with a rhythm that didn’t belong to this world. It had always been there, since he had inherited it, but now it felt alive, like a second heartbeat.

**A vision struck him suddenly**, the world around him slowing as if time had fractured. The ground beneath his feet cracked and crumbled, revealing a ruined landscape—a city overtaken by vines, its buildings collapsed and overrun by twisted, shadowy figures. They slithered and twisted through the rubble, their forms grotesque and malformed, creatures sent by Metis, a warlord Talon had only known through stories. And yet, the vision made it feel as if this was not the future, but a past event lost to time.

**Eidolons**, shadowy minions, hunted through the ruins, but something about them felt different—ancient, as if they had been part of a long-forgotten age.

His pulse quickened. This was more than just a vision; it was a warning.

---

Talon’s body jolted back to reality as a scream pierced the fog. He snapped his gaze toward Griffin, who was locked in combat with a towering Eidolon, its shadowy form seeming to shift and blend into the surrounding mist. Sari danced around it, her blades flashing in and out of the gloom like streaks of silver.

The vision still clung to the edges of Talon’s mind, the medallion’s pull stronger than ever. He could feel its whispers urging him to act, to unleash its power and end the threat. But with each pulse of the medallion, a deeper fear rooted itself within him—what if it wasn’t just a tool? What if the medallion was using him, not the other way around?

Talon’s fingers grazed the surface of the medallion, cold and unyielding. The glyphs etched into its surface glowed faintly, casting eerie shadows across his hands. His grip tightened as the temptation swelled inside him. He could feel the power at his fingertips, a surge of strength that could turn the tide of this battle.

But then, the vision of the crumbling city flashed before his eyes again, the twisted forms of Eidolons feeding off the destruction. The medallion had led him here—was it to save, or to destroy?

He pushed the thought aside, shaking his head clear. There wasn’t time to hesitate. He had to act, but the question gnawed at him: **Would it be him acting, or the medallion?**

---

In the thick of the fight, Griffin swung his blade in a desperate arc, narrowly avoiding the creature’s shadowy claws. The glowing glyphs on his sword flared, and for a moment, the Eidolon recoiled as if repelled by the blade itself. Talon’s heart skipped a beat. **Griffin didn’t know it yet**, but that sword held a piece of the Veil’s power too. And though Griffin wielded it with confidence, the true nature of that weapon had yet to reveal itself.

The Eidolon lunged forward, its mass blotting out the moonlight. Talon felt the medallion thrumming violently now, **its whispers louder than ever**. He had to resist. He couldn’t give in, not like before.

But in that moment, as the creature reared back to strike Griffin down, something inside Talon snapped. **The medallion blazed with power**, and the world shifted again.

---

Talon’s breath hitched in his throat as the world blurred around him. **The medallion’s power surged** through his veins, burning hot beneath his skin. His vision twisted, reality folding in on itself as the ground beneath him cracked and darkened. The familiar forest warped into something entirely other—**ancient temples, overgrown with alien vines**, loomed in the distance. Strange glyphs pulsed with an eerie light, not unlike the ones etched into the medallion.

For a moment, he wasn’t in the forest anymore.

He stood amidst **crumbling ruins**, the sky above torn open, revealing a darkness that bled into the horizon. The same twisted creatures he had seen earlier—the **Eidolons**—moved through the rubble, their movements jerky and unnatural, as if time itself had forgotten how to flow here. Talon’s heart raced. Was this the future or the past? He couldn’t tell anymore.

A voice—low, guttural, and ancient—whispered from within the medallion, and for a moment, Talon’s mind was filled with visions of an alien world, a world consumed by the Veil. **The Veil wasn’t just power—it was destruction, decay, and control**. He could see it now—**the ancient beings** who had tried to harness the Veil, their civilizations swallowed whole by its relentless hunger.

The whispers grew louder, urging him forward. *This is your path, Talon. You are meant to wield this power. Only you can control it.*

But even as the voice echoed in his mind, Talon felt a growing sense of dread. **What if it was lying?** What if the medallion wasn’t a gift, but a curse? What if it was leading him to the same fate as those who had come before?

---

Suddenly, the vision shattered, and **Talon was thrown back into reality** with a violent jolt. He staggered, the weight of the medallion dragging him down, its pulse now frantic, like a heart racing toward oblivion. He blinked hard, forcing his eyes to focus on the scene before him. The forest was back, but the world still felt wrong—like a half-remembered dream.

Griffin was on his knees, his sword barely holding back the **Eidolon’s massive claw**. The creature towered over him, its form shifting in and out of focus, as if it didn’t fully belong to this plane of existence. **Sari** was darting around the beast, her movements quick and precise, but even she couldn’t get close enough for a lethal strike.

**The medallion hummed louder, urging him to act.**

Talon clenched his fists, trying to fight the pull, but the weight of it was unbearable. He could feel it—**the power coursing through him**, ready to be unleashed. All it would take was a moment—just a split second to tap into it, to let the medallion do what it was meant to do.

But was he ready for that? Was he ready to risk losing control?

His mind flashed back to the vision—the **alien world consumed by the Veil**, its people destroyed by the very power they sought to control. He couldn’t let that happen. Not to him. Not to Griffin or Sari.

---

Before he could make a decision, the **Eidolon lunged**, its massive form bearing down on Griffin. Time seemed to slow, the creature’s shadow stretching across the forest floor like a dark stain. Talon’s heart raced, the medallion thrumming violently against his chest.

*Griffin can’t stop it. He’s too weak. If you don’t act now, he’ll die.*

The thought hit him like a punch to the gut, and before he could stop himself, **Talon reached for the medallion**. His fingers wrapped around the cool metal, and for a brief moment, everything went silent. The world seemed to freeze, the forest, the fog, even the Eidolon—all held in the stillness of the moment.

Then, with a surge of power, the medallion flared to life. The glyphs etched into its surface blazed with a searing light, and **Talon felt the world shift beneath him**. Time snapped back into place, and the Eidolon, just inches from striking Griffin down, **was thrown back** by an unseen force. It roared in fury as it was hurled into the trees, its massive body crashing through the forest like a falling mountain.

**Griffin collapsed to the ground**, gasping for air, his sword falling from his grip. Sari rushed to his side, her eyes wide with shock as she looked between Talon and the retreating creature.

But Talon wasn’t paying attention to them anymore. The power of the medallion still coursed through him, **wild and uncontrollable**. His vision blurred again, the whispers growing louder, more insistent.

*This is only the beginning,* the voice hissed in his mind.

Talon’s hand fell from the medallion, but the **power didn’t fade**. It lingered, burning beneath his skin, and he knew—he was in too deep now.

There was no turning back.

---

The power lingered in the air, crackling like static. Talon stood frozen, staring at his own hands, as if expecting them to burst into flame. The glyphs on the medallion still glowed faintly, casting an eerie light on his skin. It felt like a weight pressing down on his soul, something **ancient and unknowable**, coiled deep within him.

“Talon, what was that?” Sari’s voice cut through the fog, sharp and breathless. She was still kneeling next to Griffin, who clutched his sword tightly as he fought to catch his breath. The blade lay flat across his lap, the **glyphs on it glowing faintly**—a mirror of the medallion’s power. Talon’s eyes darted to it for just a second, feeling a pull toward it, something familiar and unnerving.

“I… I don’t know,” Talon muttered, his voice barely audible over the ringing in his ears. He didn’t know how to explain it. Didn’t know how to put into words the sheer magnitude of what he had felt—the medallion’s pulse had become his own, and for that brief moment, he had been something more than human. But the fear… the fear of losing control, of becoming something monstrous, gnawed at him.

Griffin’s eyes were locked on him now, **cold and calculating**. There was no mistaking the suspicion in his gaze. Talon could see it there—doubt. Fear. Maybe even anger. “You used it,” Griffin said, his tone flat but edged with something darker. “You used that thing. The medallion.”

Talon felt a chill crawl up his spine. “I didn’t have a choice,” he replied, voice tight. “If I didn’t, you’d be dead.”

“Yeah, well, you almost killed me anyway.” Griffin’s grip tightened around the hilt of his sword, and for a moment, Talon thought he might actually draw it. The glow on the blade flickered like a dying ember, and **Talon’s gaze lingered on it longer than he wanted**. There was something about that sword—something that felt connected to him, to the medallion.

Before either of them could say more, Sari stood between them, her sharp gaze flicking between both men. “Enough,” she snapped. “This isn’t the time for this.” Her voice carried the kind of authority that made both Talon and Griffin pause. Even in the tension, Sari held the group together with her commanding presence. But Talon could see it in her eyes—she was afraid, too. Afraid of what they had become. Afraid of what might happen next.

---

As the tension thickened, the forest around them shifted unnaturally, as though the very air had been warped by the medallion’s power. The fog deepened, the trees creaking as if alive. The Eidolon had retreated for now, but Talon could still feel its presence, lurking somewhere out there, waiting.

The momentary silence between the group was broken by a distant sound—**footsteps in the mist**, deliberate and heavy. Talon heard the cracks of sticks underneath feet and began to panic. He shot a glance at Sari but she ignored them simply kneeling at Griffin's side tending this wounds. Talon felt the medallion pulse once more, and got into a crouch waiting for something to lunge from behind the brush. The medallion gave a vibriatiing sensation that felt like a warning. Talon gave another flick of his eyes to his friends but they were still not reacting. He gave a panicked shout which brought their attention  but not their panic. They weren't hearing this.

“We’re not alone,” Talon stammered, taking a defensive stance. Griffin rose to his feet, but confussion was evedent on his face. Talon instinctively touched the medallion, feeling its hum vibrate through his bones, but he didn’t dare unleash it again. Not yet.

A figure emerged from the fog, cloaked and moving with an unnerving grace, like someone who didn’t belong to this world. Talon jumped in start but Sari and Griffin just stared at him.  The forest seemed to part for them, the fog swirling at their feet. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest. There was something familiar about the way this figure moved, something that stirred the memories of the **premonition** he had just experienced.

Talon what are you staring at Sari whispered. “Who are you?” Talon's voice was hard, his going to his blade.

The figure stopped just at the edge of visibility, their face hidden beneath a hood, only their voice echoing through the mist.

“I know what you seek,” the voice said, low and cryptic. “And I know the cost of wielding it.”

Talon’s breath caught in his throat. The medallion pulsed in response, but it wasn’t pulling him this time—it was warning him.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a **scarred, weathered face** that seemed to have seen far too much of the world’s suffering. Talon stepped back in response. Then the figured spoke again “The Veil is not what you think it is,” they continued, it's eyes locking onto Talon. “You have no idea what you’re holding.”

Sari and Griffin exchanged a wary glance, both uncertain how to proceed. Talon, however, could only focus on the weight of the medallion pressing against his chest, the voice of the Veil still whispering in his mind, twisting his thoughts, blurring the line between what was real and what was the **Veil’s influence**.

The figure’s gaze never left Talon. A prophetic voice spoke again, “the Veil will consume you. Just as it has consumed those before you.”

Talon’s hand tightened around his blade, its cold hilt pressed up against his two fingers. For the first time, he felt like he was standing at the edge of something far greater than himself—an abyss that he wasn’t sure he could escape.

And just like that, the stranger disappeared into the mist, leaving behind only a lingering sense of dread.

Talon fell to his knees gasping and sobbing. His fate become ever so real. He lost all control and snot ran down his face. Sari ran to console him but Griffin just stared like a parent who stares at a hurt child who has fallen after a ignored warning. 

The **Veil was watching.** And Talon knew that whatever came next, there would be no turning back.
