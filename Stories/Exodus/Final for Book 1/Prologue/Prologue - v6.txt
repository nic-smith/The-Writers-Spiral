**Prologue: Fractured Premonitions**

Talon’s breath came in shallow, ragged gasps as the world twisted around him. He was in the same forest, yet it wasn’t. The trees here were gnarled, blackened by some unseen rot, their bark stretching toward the sky like skeletal hands. In the distance, he saw cities—no, ruins—engulfed in flames. Their once proud towers now crumbled, overrun with shadows that crawled and twisted like living things.

The air was thick with the scent of decay, and in the distance, he could hear them. **The whispers**. Faint at first, but growing louder. **The Veil** was speaking to him again, tugging at his mind. The medallion around his neck pulsed in response, its glyphs glowing faintly beneath his shirt, warming his skin like a brand. 

He looked ahead, and in the dream, Griffin and Sari were fighting—no, struggling. **Eidolons**, their eyes cold and mechanical, had cornered them, closing in. In the dream world, the shadows of the Eidolons stretched long, shifting into monstrous, animalistic forms. 

And just beyond them, barely visible through the fog, was a **shadowy figure**. It stood motionless, watching. 

“**Daniel?**” Talon whispered. The name came unbidden, as if pulled from a memory he didn’t know he had. But the figure didn’t respond. It remained still, its eyes hidden in shadow, yet Talon could feel its gaze burning into him.

Suddenly, **Griffin screamed**, and Talon snapped back to reality. 

The familiar forest snapped back into focus, but the danger was real now. Talon could hear the Eidolons’ mechanical limbs as they crept through the fog. This wasn’t a vision. This was happening.

Griffin’s sword sliced through the mist, catching the dim light as it collided with one of the shadowy creatures. The glyphs on his blade flared up for a brief moment, illuminating the clearing. **Sari’s blades** moved with precision, cutting down another Eidolon as it lunged at her.

“Talon, move!” Sari’s voice cut through the haze in his mind, and he stumbled backward, gripping the medallion tight.

The **whispers** returned. Use me. Unleash me. **You’ll die if you don’t.**

But he resisted, clenching his jaw. The medallion felt heavier, the warmth turning into an almost painful burn against his skin.

Before he could respond, there was a new sound—low, guttural, and unnerving.

A **bear** burst from the trees, its massive form twisted and unnatural. Its fur was matted with blood, its eyes glowing with the same faint glyphs as Talon’s medallion. The Veil had touched this creature, warping it, turning it into a **corrupted force of nature**. The bear wasn’t just here by chance—it had been drawn to the medallion’s power.

Talon’s stomach lurched. They had been running low on food for days, thinking their only enemy was the Eidolons. But now, they faced something primal, something **corrupted** by the same force they were trying to escape.

The bear’s glowing eyes locked onto them, and without warning, it **charged**.

Griffin, still catching his breath from the Eidolon fight, barely had time to react. He raised his sword just in time to block the bear’s first swipe, but the force sent him sprawling into the dirt. 

“Talon!” Sari’s shout brought him back, but his limbs felt heavy, as if the medallion was weighing him down more than usual. The **Veil’s influence** was stronger here, in this corrupted part of the forest.

He watched in horror as the bear loomed over Griffin, its breath ragged and its claws gleaming in the faint light. Talon’s fingers twitched toward the medallion.

The whispers were louder now. **Save them. You can control it.**

No.

Not again.

But as Griffin struggled beneath the creature, a decision had to be made. Talon’s eyes flicked to the medallion, then to Sari, who was moving fast but would never make it in time. He pulled the medallion from his neck, its glyphs burning brighter than ever, and with a sharp cry, **he hurled it at Griffin**.

“Do you think you can handle it, Griffin?!” Talon screamed. 

The medallion landed near Griffin, who instinctively recoiled from it. But in that split second of hesitation, Sari leapt onto the bear’s back, plunging her blades into its hide with all her strength.

The bear roared in pain, rearing back. For a moment, it seemed like it would throw her off, but she held on tight, twisting the blades deeper. The creature staggered, letting out one final, pained cry before collapsing to the ground.

The clearing fell silent, save for their ragged breathing.

Griffin pushed himself to his feet, his gaze locking onto the medallion at his feet. His eyes flicked to Talon, his expression unreadable. Slowly, he bent down, picked up the medallion, and tossed it back.

“Next time, don’t make me choose.”

Talon caught the medallion, his heart racing. The whispers were still there, but they were softer now, as if the Veil had receded slightly after the bear’s death. But the consequences were clear—every time he touched the medallion, it left a mark. And it wasn’t just on him.
