Prologue: Fractured Premonitions

The ground cracked beneath Talon’s boots, veins of dark energy snaking through the earth as shadows stretched unnaturally in every direction. He stumbled forward, barely able to see through the haze of smoke that filled the air. The world around him was decaying, cities reduced to ruins in the distance, the sky fractured and bleeding light. His heart pounded, and in the chaos, he saw them—Griffin and Sari, battling the shadowy forms of Eidolons. 

The creatures were twisted amalgamations of flesh and metal, claws glinting in the dim light as they swarmed the duo. Griffin swung his sword, glowing glyphs illuminating the smoke as he deflected one attack after another. His strikes were powerful but slowing; fatigue was setting in. Sari danced between the Eidolons, her blades flashing silver as she struck precise, lethal blows. Yet, for every creature they cut down, two more seemed to take its place.

Talon tried to move, to shout, but his voice was swallowed by the crushing silence of the vision. He was locked in place, a helpless observer as the battle unfolded before him. The medallion around his neck pulsed, sending a cold shiver through his spine. It wanted him to use it—to let its power surge through him and tear the creatures apart. He resisted, clenching his fists. 

But then, the vision shifted. Time slowed as one of the Eidolons lunged at Griffin, claws outstretched, aiming for his exposed side. In the dreamlike haze, Talon saw it happening, knew it was coming, but he was too late. Griffin turned just as the creature struck, and the force of the blow knocked him to the ground. Blood spilled onto the cracked earth.

“No!” Talon screamed, but the word came out as a whisper, lost in the void. His chest tightened, breath catching as the world blurred around him. 

Suddenly, the scene shifted again—everything spun, and Talon found himself standing in the midst of a burning forest. The air was thick with the scent of ash and decay, and the trees seemed to warp and twist, branches curling unnaturally toward the sky. He spun around, searching for Griffin and Sari, but they were gone. All that remained was the endless, suffocating fog.

That’s when he saw it—a shadowy figure at the edge of his vision. Tall, cloaked, and watching him. Talon’s blood ran cold as the figure took a step forward, its form flickering like a glitch in reality. It was as if the Veil itself was manifesting in front of him, teasing him, testing him. 

He tried to focus, to make out its features, but everything twisted again. 

The figure disappeared, swallowed by the swirling fog, and Talon collapsed to his knees, gasping for air as the vision unraveled. His mind swam, fighting to hold onto reality, but the pull of the medallion was relentless. It whispered to him, its words unclear but tempting, calling him deeper into the darkness.

The real world returned in a flash of blinding light, and Talon jerked awake, drenched in sweat. His hand flew to the medallion, feeling its cold surface against his skin. The whispering had stopped, but the weight of the vision lingered.

The Eidolons were real. The fight was coming.

Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps as he blinked away the remnants of the vision. The cold, damp reality of the forest settled around him, its stillness unnerving. His heart still raced, the feeling of helplessness from the premonition clinging to him like a heavy fog. But now, there was no crumbling world, no shadowy figure. Just the suffocating weight of the present.

Griffin and Sari were already moving. He heard the crackle of dry leaves underfoot as they positioned themselves, their faces set with grim determination. They had seen nothing of his vision, had no idea what he had just witnessed.

“Talon, get up,” Griffin snapped, not turning to look at him. His sword was already drawn, the faint glow of its glyphs barely visible in the pre-dawn light. “They’re here.”

Talon’s eyes widened as he scrambled to his feet, the weight of the medallion pressing against his chest. He knew what was coming. The same creatures from his vision—the Eidolons—were now here, in the flesh, closing in. Their movements were barely perceptible in the thick forest shadows, but he could feel them. 

“Where?” he asked, his voice hoarse.

“Everywhere,” Griffin growled. “They’ve been tracking us for miles.”

Sari stepped closer to Talon, her blades glinting as she adjusted her stance. She caught his eye, her expression a mix of concern and resolve. “You alright?”

Talon nodded, though the truth was far more complicated. His head still throbbed from the vision, and the whispers of the medallion hadn’t fully faded. The weight of what he had seen, of what might happen to Griffin, clung to him like a dark omen. 

“We have to move,” Griffin said, his voice tight with urgency. “They’re closing in fast.”

Before anyone could respond, the first Eidolon broke through the underbrush with a snarl, its metallic claws scraping against the rocky ground. It moved with terrifying speed, a blur of shadows and metal, its eyes glowing with a sickly yellow light.

Griffin swung his sword in an arc, meeting the creature’s attack head-on. The force of the impact sent a shockwave through the air, and for a moment, Talon could see the faint flicker of the glyphs along the sword’s edge. The creature recoiled, but not before another leaped forward, its claws aimed directly at Griffin’s exposed side.

“No!” Talon shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos.

Without thinking, Talon’s hand flew to the medallion, his fingers brushing its surface. He felt the surge of power, the pull of its energy, and for a moment, he considered using it—letting it flow through him and into the battle. The whispers began again, soft at first, then growing louder.

Do it. Save him. 

But he hesitated. The vision—Griffin falling, blood spilling—flashed before his eyes. He couldn’t let it happen. He wouldn’t.

Griffin deflected the second attack with a grunt, his sword slicing through the creature’s arm, sending sparks and black fluid spraying across the forest floor. But it wasn’t enough. Another Eidolon darted from the shadows, flanking Griffin from behind.

Talon’s chest tightened. The medallion pulsed, urging him to act. But he couldn’t. He didn’t trust himself—didn’t trust what the medallion might do if he let its power take control.

Sari moved in beside Griffin, her twin blades flashing as she intercepted the third Eidolon with a precision strike to its throat. The creature staggered, its body twitching violently before collapsing into a heap of metal and flesh.

“Stay with me, Talon!” Sari shouted, her voice cutting through the fog of his indecision. “We can’t hold them off forever.”

Talon clenched his fists, the whispers growing louder, more insistent. He could feel the power building inside him, ready to be unleashed. But was it his power—or the Veil’s?

The forest erupted into chaos. Talon’s world narrowed to the clash of steel, the snarls of the Eidolons, and the pounding of his heart in his ears. Each moment stretched unbearably long as the battle unfolded, echoing the vision that had warned him of this very fight. The medallion pulsed against his chest, almost alive, begging to be used, its whispers a constant pressure at the edge of his mind.

"Griffin!" Sari’s shout cut through the noise as another Eidolon launched itself at Griffin’s unguarded side. Talon could see it happening, just as he had in the vision. Griffin turned too late, the creature’s claws already descending.

The medallion’s whispers rose to a deafening crescendo.

Do it. Use it. Save him.

Talon’s hand twitched toward the medallion, fingers trembling. The power was there, coiled like a serpent, ready to strike. All he had to do was let go, let the Veil's energy flow through him, but the vision’s shadow lingered. He didn’t trust what would happen if he gave in. He had seen Griffin fall. What if the medallion made it worse? What if—

Griffin let out a roar, pivoting at the last moment to bring his sword up, catching the Eidolon’s claws in a shower of sparks. His eyes met Talon’s, burning with frustration.

"Stop hesitating, Talon! We need you!" Griffin shouted, his voice rough with exertion as he pushed the creature back, his sword glowing faintly in the dim light.

Talon’s breath caught in his throat. In that instant, something snapped inside him. He felt the heat rise, not just from the medallion but from deep within—anger, frustration, the weight of everything crashing down at once. 

Without thinking, he yanked the medallion from his neck and hurled it at Griffin’s feet. 

"You think you can handle it better?" Talon’s voice cracked with emotion, raw and loud. "Take it! Do you think you’d do any better with this thing? You have no idea what it’s like!"

Griffin glanced down at the medallion, his eyes wide with surprise, the weight of Talon’s words sinking in as the battle raged around them. For a split second, the air between them was thick with unspoken tension.

Sari’s blades flashed as she fought off another Eidolon, her voice sharp with warning. "This isn’t the time, Talon! We’re in the middle of a fight!"

Talon stood frozen, chest heaving, his eyes burning with unshed tears, torn between picking up the medallion and letting it lie there at Griffin’s feet. He had been struggling with it for so long, its whispers twisting through his mind like poison, and now, at this critical moment, he had reached his breaking point.

But the forest wasn’t waiting for him to make a decision. With a snarl, an Eidolon broke through Sari’s defenses, its claws catching her arm as she deflected the blow. She hissed in pain, but didn’t back down, driving her blades deep into the creature’s side.

Talon watched as Griffin’s eyes flicked between him, the medallion, and the next wave of approaching Eidolons. His hesitation was brief, but it was enough to ignite something deep in Talon’s chest. A spark of realization—he couldn’t walk away from this. Not now. 

Griffin kicked the medallion back toward Talon, his voice low but steady. "This isn’t just about you, Talon. We need you. Whatever that thing is, you have to control it. Now."

The words struck Talon harder than any blow. His hands trembled as he crouched to retrieve the medallion, the familiar weight of it settling back around his neck. He could still hear the whispers, feel the pull, but Griffin was right. He had to find a way to control it—for their sake.

Taking a deep breath, Talon stood tall, his gaze meeting Griffin’s. "I’ll try."

The moment was shattered as more Eidolons burst through the treeline, their metallic howls filling the air. The group readied themselves, bracing for the next attack. Talon tightened his grip on the medallion, feeling the power thrumming beneath the surface, but this time, he didn’t let it take control.

This time, he fought it.

As the creatures closed in, Talon’s focus sharpened, his senses alive with adrenaline. Griffin and Sari moved beside him, their movements in sync, each strike a calculated response to the Eidolons' attacks. And for the first time, Talon felt the medallion’s whispers quiet, just enough for him to think clearly.

They would survive this. He would survive this.

But deep down, Talon knew that this was only the beginning.
