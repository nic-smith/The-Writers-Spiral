**Prologue: Fractured Premonitions**

The air in the forest was thick, choking with the scent of decay. The trees loomed like skeletal sentinels, their twisted branches cutting jagged lines against the bruised sky. Talon could feel the weight of the medallion against his chest, heavier than it had ever been. It pulsed, a rhythm not entirely his own, as though it had a heartbeat of its own—ancient and indifferent. Each throb echoed through his chest, a reminder of the power it held and the danger it posed.

The world shifted around him. One moment he was standing with Griffin and Sari, the damp ground beneath his boots. The next, he was elsewhere—somewhere far more ancient and terrible. The air in this new place was oppressive, vibrating with a strange energy. Talon knew he wasn’t awake, but he also knew this wasn’t just a dream. It was another one of the medallion’s visions. His skin tingled with an unsettling awareness, and he could feel the medallion pulling him deeper into this warped reality.

Around him, the landscape twisted. The trees no longer resembled trees but monstrous shapes with bark that oozed black sap. The ground was cracked and dry, and the sky... the sky was wrong. It wasn’t just dark—it was fragmented, as if something had torn through it, leaving jagged scars of light across the horizon. The land stretched into ruins, crumbling buildings and monoliths that bore unfamiliar glyphs. Talon recognized the markings—they were the same as those on the medallion. His pulse quickened.

In the distance, shadowy figures moved, their forms barely distinguishable against the backdrop of the ruined world. They were **Eidolons**, and Talon knew they were hunting—searching. For him. 

He looked down at his hands and found them covered in the same glowing glyphs. They snaked across his skin, burning with an ethereal light that seemed to pulse in time with the medallion. He clenched his fists, trying to shake the feeling of something creeping under his skin. The power was growing, intensifying. He felt it vibrating in his bones, whispering promises of control, of strength, of domination. But he knew better than to trust it.

The **vision** shifted again. This time, he wasn’t alone. He saw **Griffin** and **Sari**, their faces pale and strained, fighting off the advancing Eidolons. Their weapons glinted in the dim light—Sari’s twin blades moving with precision and grace, Griffin’s sword heavy and brutal in his hands. But for every Eidolon they struck down, more seemed to materialize from the shadows. 

Griffin turned toward Talon, his eyes locking onto him, desperation etched into every line of his face. “Talon!” he shouted, his voice barely audible over the growing roar of the oncoming creatures. “We need you!”

But Talon was stuck, frozen in place by the weight of the vision. He tried to move, to lift his hand, but the medallion’s power wrapped tighter around him, pulling him deeper into the dream. The glyphs on his skin glowed brighter, burning like fire as they consumed him.

Then, just as an Eidolon lunged at Griffin, everything shifted again. Time slowed to a crawl. The creature’s jagged claws reached for Griffin’s throat, and Talon could do nothing but watch, helpless. The vision blurred, the lines between reality and the medallion’s power fracturing even further. 

His breath caught in his throat. Was this real? Would Griffin die because of him?

Just as the Eidolon’s claws were about to tear into Griffin, the scene dissolved. Talon was ripped back into the present, heart pounding in his chest, the vision still lingering in the corners of his mind like a shadow that refused to leave. He gasped, stumbling backward as the reality of the forest came crashing back into focus.

Talon staggered, his breath ragged. The world around him came rushing back—the sound of rustling leaves, the faint crackle of a dying campfire, and the cold bite of the evening air. His legs felt weak beneath him, as if the weight of the medallion had drained the strength from his body. But there was no time to dwell on it. Something was wrong. The forest was too still, too quiet.

A sharp cry split the air.

He whipped around just in time to see Sari leap into action, her twin blades glinting in the low light. She moved like a shadow, her movements swift and calculated as she engaged the first Eidolon that emerged from the treeline. The creature was monstrous, its form a grotesque mix of sinew and metal, glowing eyes locked onto its prey.

Griffin was already in the thick of the fight, his massive sword cleaving through another Eidolon with brutal efficiency. The glyphs on his blade flared to life with each swing, casting an eerie blue glow across his face. Talon’s vision from moments earlier felt like a premonition playing out in real time. The same desperation etched on Griffin’s face, the same relentless horde of creatures closing in. But this wasn’t a dream. This was real.

“Talon!” Griffin’s voice cut through the chaos, his gaze darting toward him. “Snap out of it! We need you!”

Talon’s heart raced, but his feet refused to move. The medallion throbbed against his chest, the power inside it surging, urging him to give in. It wanted him to unleash it, to tear the Eidolons apart with a single thought. But he couldn’t. Not again. The last time he’d let the medallion take control, he’d barely stopped himself from destroying everything around him. Including Griffin and Sari.

Another Eidolon lunged at Sari, its clawed hands reaching for her throat. She ducked, her blades slicing through the creature’s abdomen, but more were coming. They were always coming. No matter how many they cut down, the Eidolons kept coming, relentless and unyielding. Talon could see it in her eyes—the weariness, the growing doubt. Even Sari, with all her precision and strength, couldn’t keep this up forever.

Griffin blocked a blow aimed at his head, the force of the impact sending him stumbling backward. His sword flashed as he parried another attack, but the Eidolons were surrounding him, closing in. Talon’s pulse quickened, his hand instinctively reaching for the medallion.

No. He couldn’t. He wouldn’t.

“Talon!” Griffin shouted again, his voice strained as he struggled to hold off the creatures. “We’re not going to survive this without you!”

Talon’s hand hovered over the medallion, his fingers trembling. The power inside it called to him, louder now, more insistent. He could feel it—just beneath the surface, waiting to be unleashed. One thought, one command, and the tide would turn. He could save them.

But at what cost?

His chest tightened as memories of the last time he’d given in flooded his mind. The devastation. The uncontrollable surge of power that had left him reeling, barely able to pull himself back from the brink. He could still see the destruction in his mind’s eye, the way the ground had splintered, the trees torn apart by the sheer force of the medallion’s will.

He shook his head, trying to clear the haze of fear and doubt. This wasn’t like before. He was stronger now. He could control it.

Or could he?

Sari was tiring, her movements becoming slower, more labored. Griffin was barely holding on, his sword swinging with less force, his steps faltering. The Eidolons were closing in, their claws gleaming in the dim light, their low, mechanical growls filling the air.

Talon’s heart pounded in his ears. He had no choice. If he didn’t act, they were all going to die.

His fingers curled around the medallion, the cool metal searing into his palm as its power surged through him. It felt like fire, burning from the inside out, but he gritted his teeth and held on, forcing the energy into submission. The world around him shifted, blurring at the edges as the medallion’s influence seeped into reality. The trees trembled, the ground shook, and the air crackled with energy.

The Eidolons hesitated for a split second, their glowing eyes flickering as they sensed the change in the air. It was all the opening Sari needed. She darted forward, her blades cutting through the nearest creature with lethal precision. Griffin followed suit, his sword carving a path through the remaining Eidolons.

But the medallion wasn’t done. Its power surged, spiraling out of control, slipping from Talon’s grasp as he tried to reign it in. His vision blurred, and the world tilted, the line between reality and the Veil fracturing once again.

Talon’s vision swam, the world bending unnaturally as the medallion's power lashed out. The ground beneath him trembled, cracks forming along the dirt like veins of some ancient creature awakening. He could feel the medallion pulling harder, dragging him deeper into its grasp. The whispered voices from the Veil grew louder, almost a chant, but their words were still indecipherable—dark, twisted murmurs that made his skin crawl.

“Control it… Control it!” Talon muttered to himself, trying to tether his mind to the present.

But it was too late.

The power surged again, the force of it rippling through the air and slamming into the remaining Eidolons. The creatures staggered, their mechanical limbs jerking unnaturally as they were lifted off the ground by an invisible force. Sari and Griffin watched, wide-eyed, as the creatures convulsed mid-air, their distorted growls becoming more frantic.

Talon gritted his teeth, his muscles tensing as he struggled to pull the power back. The air around him hummed with a dangerous intensity, crackling like a storm on the verge of breaking. His hands shook, and the medallion burned against his chest, its glow intensifying, casting harsh shadows across the forest floor.

Then, with a blinding flash of light, the power exploded outward, ripping through the air like a shockwave. The Eidolons were hurled backward, their bodies colliding with the twisted trees before crumpling to the ground, lifeless.

The forest fell into an eerie silence.

Talon stumbled, the world spinning as the force of the medallion’s energy drained him. His vision dimmed at the edges, his legs giving out beneath him. He hit the ground hard, the taste of dirt filling his mouth. For a moment, everything was still—no more whispers, no more pulsing energy. Just the cold, still night and the faint flicker of the dying campfire in the distance.

Sari was the first to move. She rushed to his side, her blades still glinting with Eidolon blood. “Talon?” Her voice was steady, but there was an edge of concern beneath it. “Are you with us?”

Griffin stood back, his sword lowered but still gripped tightly in his hand, his eyes locked on Talon. His breathing was heavy, his face set in a grim expression. The tension between them was palpable, the unspoken words hanging thick in the air.

Talon blinked, trying to clear his vision. His entire body felt like it had been through a wringer, every muscle aching from the strain of holding the medallion’s power back. He nodded weakly, but he could feel Griffin’s gaze burning into him, full of suspicion and doubt.

“We can’t keep doing this,” Griffin said, his voice low but firm. He didn’t look at Sari—his focus was entirely on Talon. “You almost lost control again.”

Talon pushed himself up onto his elbows, his breath still ragged. He could barely form a response. He wanted to argue, to tell Griffin that he had it under control, but the truth weighed heavy on him. He didn’t have it under control. Not really. The medallion’s power was growing stronger, and each time he used it, the line between himself and the Veil became harder to define.

Sari placed a hand on Talon’s shoulder, her touch grounding him. “Griffin, give him a minute. We’re all tired. And you’re hurt.”

Griffin shook his head, wiping the sweat from his brow. His sword was still faintly glowing with the glyphs that only Talon could fully understand. “We’re running out of time, Sari. This isn’t about being tired.”

The tension was thick, but before Sari could reply, the night was shattered by another sound—this one deeper, more guttural. It was distant at first, a low rumble echoing through the forest, but it was drawing closer. Talon’s heart raced as he turned his head, searching the darkness beyond the firelight.

“What now?” Griffin muttered, raising his sword instinctively.

The ground beneath them trembled again, but this time it wasn’t the medallion’s doing. The sound grew louder—a heavy, rhythmic pounding, like the footfalls of something massive. Talon’s blood ran cold as the realization hit him.

Something was coming.

The trees at the edge of the clearing shifted, their branches snapping as a hulking shadow lumbered into view. For a moment, the trio stood frozen, their breath held as they tried to make sense of what they were seeing.

It wasn’t another Eidolon. This was something far more primal.

A massive bear, its fur matted and dirty, its eyes wild and gleaming in the dim light, stepped into the clearing. Its nostrils flared as it caught the scent of blood from the slain Eidolons, and it let out a deep, menacing growl that reverberated through the trees.

“Great,” Sari muttered, her blades already up. “As if the Eidolons weren’t enough.”

The bear’s massive frame shifted, its muscles tensing as it locked eyes with the group. For a moment, there was silence—an uneasy standoff between man and beast. Then, with a sudden burst of speed, the bear charged.
