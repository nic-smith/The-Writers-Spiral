**Prologue: Fractured Visions and Relentless Threats**

The forest was an oppressive tangle of shadows, branches clawing at their clothes as Talon, Griffin, and Sari pushed through the thick underbrush. The silence between them was heavy, broken only by the soft thud of their boots on damp earth and the occasional rustle of something unseen moving in the trees. The fog hung low, clinging to them like a predator watching its prey. It was almost too quiet.

Suddenly, the air changed—charged with a presence Talon couldn’t explain. His hand instinctively went to the medallion around his neck, its cool metal pulsing faintly against his skin. Before he could say anything, they were hit.

Out of the fog, dark shapes materialized—**Eidolons**—their forms shifting and unnatural. They moved like living shadows, merging with the mist, eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light. Talon barely had time to shout a warning before one lunged at Griffin, its claws extended.

Griffin was fast, his sword already drawn, the **glowing glyphs** on the blade flickering as he deflected the blow. The impact sent him stumbling back, but he held his ground, his face set in determination.

Sari moved with practiced precision, her twin blades flashing as she cut through the fog, slicing into an Eidolon with a fluid motion. The creature howled, a sound that was both mechanical and organic, before dissolving into the mist.

Talon’s heart raced. He wanted to help, but the **medallion** burned against his chest, pulling his focus away from the fight. The whispers were there again, louder this time, urging him to use its power. **Just a little**, they seemed to say. **You could end this in seconds.** He shook his head, trying to block them out, his hand tightening around the medallion.

Another Eidolon lunged at Griffin, and this time, he wasn’t fast enough. The creature’s claws raked across his arm, blood splattering onto the ground. Griffin grunted in pain, but with a roar of defiance, he swung his sword upward, catching the Eidolon under the jaw. The creature let out a shriek and vanished into the mist, leaving only a wisp of shadow in its place.

Talon could feel the medallion’s power surging, the temptation to give in gnawing at him. He hesitated, torn between the fear of losing control and the need to protect his friends. His vision blurred, the edges of reality distorting as the **Veil’s influence** grew stronger.

“**Talon!**” Sari’s voice cut through the haze, snapping him back to the present. She was fending off two Eidolons at once, her movements fluid and deadly. But she wouldn’t be able to hold them off for long.

Talon’s breathing quickened. The medallion pulsed harder, its whispers turning to a low hum that resonated deep within him. His fingers twitched as he reached for it, ready to release the power.

But then, something shifted in the fog. A presence, darker than the Eidolons, moving with a deliberate, almost human, grace. For a moment, Talon thought he saw the outline of a **shadowy figure**, tall and imposing, watching from the edge of the battlefield. His heart pounded in his chest. Was it real, or just another trick of the Veil?

Before he could process it, an Eidolon lunged at him, breaking his focus.

Talon sidestepped just in time, narrowly avoiding the Eidolon’s attack. His mind was racing, the **shadowy figure** still lingering at the edge of his vision, but the fight demanded his full attention now. He raised his dagger and slashed at the creature’s flank, the blade connecting with a jarring thud as the Eidolon recoiled, hissing.

Sari had already dispatched one of her attackers, but the second was relentless. The fog wrapped around the Eidolon, making it hard to see its movements, and the forest itself seemed to warp as it twisted through the trees. Talon could see her struggling to keep up, her breath labored, her focus sharp but slipping.

Without thinking, Talon moved to help her, his feet stumbling over the uneven ground as the medallion throbbed against his chest. The whispers returned, insistent and seductive, promising power if he would only let go. **Why fight it? You need us.**

The pull was almost too strong this time. Talon’s fingers twitched, ready to rip the medallion free and give in to the energy that crackled just beneath the surface. But before he could act, another Eidolon emerged from the fog, its glowing eyes locking onto him.

Griffin was closer, bleeding from the earlier strike, but still standing tall, his sword raised defensively. “Talon!” he called, voice strained but commanding. “Don’t lose focus now!”

Talon blinked, the sound of Griffin’s voice snapping him back to reality. The medallion’s power was dangerous. He knew that, and he couldn’t afford to risk losing control, not here, not now. But still, the weight of its power tugged at him, heavier with every passing second.

Griffin charged forward, intercepting the Eidolon before it could reach Talon. The glyphs on his sword flared to life as the blade clashed against the creature’s dark, ethereal body. It screeched, more mechanical this time, as if something deep within its form had malfunctioned. Griffin twisted his wrist, driving the sword deeper, until the Eidolon dissolved into the fog like the others.

Panting, Griffin looked back at Talon, frustration clear in his eyes. “We don’t have time for this, Talon! Either control it or stay out of the way!”

Talon’s chest tightened with guilt. He hadn’t been fast enough, and Griffin had paid the price. His mind raced with the implications. The **medallion was becoming a liability**, just as Griffin feared.

“**I’ve got it!**” Sari yelled from behind them, her voice filled with tension but still steady. She had just managed to disarm the last Eidolon, its form crumpling into the underbrush with a final screech. Her blades gleamed under the dim light filtering through the fog, the shadows wrapping around her like a second skin. 

Talon’s breath came fast, his eyes darting between his friends. For a moment, the battlefield was still—no more Eidolons rushing from the mist, no sounds except the pounding of his heart. 

But then the ground shifted beneath their feet. It wasn’t an attack this time—it was something else entirely. A **low growl**, deep and rumbling, echoed through the trees. Talon felt his stomach drop.

“What... what was that?” Sari asked, her eyes wide with confusion.

The growl came again, this time louder, closer. The fog parted as something **massive** lumbered into view. Talon’s blood went cold as he realized what it was—a **bear**, far larger than any he’d ever seen. Its fur was matted and wild, its eyes dark and unreadable. This was no ordinary predator.

“We need to move,” Griffin muttered, his eyes narrowing as he sized up the creature. “Now.”

But the bear had already noticed them.

The bear let out a guttural roar, the sound reverberating through the trees, and then it charged. Talon’s heart leapt into his throat. The Eidolons had been terrifying in their own right, but this was different—this was raw, uncontrollable force barreling toward them.

“Scatter!” Griffin barked, pushing Talon to the side as he took a defensive stance with his sword. “Talon, stay back—this isn’t something you can fight!”

Sari, quick on her feet, darted to the left, her eyes locked on the bear’s massive form. It moved faster than Talon had expected, closing the distance between them with alarming speed. The ground trembled beneath its weight, and for a brief moment, Talon froze, unsure whether to fight or run.

Griffin didn’t hesitate. With a shout, he charged forward, his sword raised high. The glyphs on the blade flickered in the misty light, their faint glow barely illuminating the space between him and the bear. He swung hard, aiming for the bear’s side, but the creature was too fast, veering to the right at the last second. The sword grazed its fur, barely drawing blood.

The bear roared again, its massive paw swiping at Griffin. He barely dodged, the force of the blow sending him stumbling backward. Talon watched in horror as Griffin’s foot caught on a root, and he fell hard to the ground, his sword clattering out of reach.

“Griffin!” Sari shouted, sprinting toward him. But the bear was already advancing, its eyes locked on Griffin, ready to strike again.

Without thinking, Talon’s hand went to the medallion. The whispers were there again, stronger than ever. **Use me. You have no choice. You can save him.** 

Talon’s fingers closed around the medallion, the cool metal burning against his skin. He could feel the power coursing through it, begging to be unleashed. But no—he couldn’t lose control now. Not like this.

Instead, Talon grabbed a nearby branch, thick and gnarled, and hurled it at the bear with all his strength. The branch hit the bear squarely in the side, causing it to flinch and look toward Talon.

It was a stupid move—he knew that—but it bought Griffin enough time to scramble back to his feet. Sari was already there, helping him regain his balance, her blades glinting as she stood between him and the bear.

The bear snarled, its attention now divided between Talon and the others. For a moment, the three of them stood frozen, the tension in the air almost unbearable.

And then, as quickly as it had come, the bear hesitated. It sniffed the air, its dark eyes darting between the three of them, as if weighing whether they were worth the trouble. Then, without warning, it turned and lumbered back into the fog, disappearing into the shadows as though it had never been there.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Talon let out a shaky breath, his hand still clenched around the medallion. His entire body was trembling, not from fear of the bear but from how close he’d come to using the power again. How close he’d come to giving in.

Griffin groaned, clutching his side where the bear’s paw had grazed him. “That was... too close,” he muttered, breathing heavily. “I thought that thing was going to tear me apart.”

Sari was already inspecting Griffin’s wounds, her hands steady as she pressed a cloth against the bleeding. “We’re lucky it didn’t,” she said, her voice tight. “But next time, we might not be so lucky.”

Talon stood a few feet away, staring at the medallion in his hand. His heart still raced, the whispers still lingered in his mind, but the danger had passed. He had resisted—for now. But he knew that next time, it might not be so easy.

“We can’t stay here,” Griffin said, his voice grim. “That thing will be back, or something worse will find us.”

Talon nodded, slipping the medallion back under his shirt. The forest loomed around them, dark and oppressive, and the feeling of being hunted had not left. If anything, it had only grown stronger.

“We move,” Sari said, helping Griffin to his feet. “And we don’t stop until we find a place to rest.”

Together, they gathered their things and pressed on, the weight of the forest closing in around them as they disappeared into the fog once more.
