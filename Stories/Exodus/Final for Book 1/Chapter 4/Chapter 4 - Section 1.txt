**Chapter 4: The Revenant’s Hunt**

**The Revenant Appears**

The night settled around them like a suffocating blanket, heavy with the weight of unseen dangers. The fire had long since died down to embers, casting faint, flickering shadows against the twisted trunks of the trees. Talon sat with his back against a rough oak, his body tense, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond their camp. The air was still, too still, as if the forest was holding its breath.

Every sound felt amplified—the distant rustle of leaves, the soft crackling of the dying fire, the steady rhythm of his own heartbeat. But something was wrong. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched, stalked by something far more dangerous than the Eidolons they had faced before.

Sari was curled up beside him, her eyes closed but her body tense, as though sleep had eluded her too. Griffin sat a few feet away, his knife out, sharpening it with a slow, deliberate motion that cut through the silence. His face was set in a hard frown, his eyes fixed on the forest as if daring something to emerge from the shadows.

Talon’s hand moved instinctively to the cuff, feeling the cool metal against his skin. The hum was faint now, almost imperceptible, but it was still there, a constant reminder of the power that lay dormant beneath the surface. He had barely touched the cuff since their last encounter with the Eidolons. He didn’t trust it—didn’t trust what it did to him. But the weight of its presence never left him.

Griffin’s voice broke the silence, low and gruff. "We need to move at first light."

Talon glanced over at him, his mind still half-distracted by the strange sense of unease that had settled in his chest. "Move where? We don’t even know where we’re going anymore."

Griffin didn’t look up from his knife. "Away from here. This place isn’t right. Haven’t you noticed? It’s too quiet. It feels like…"

"Like something’s watching us," Talon finished, his voice barely above a whisper.

Griffin nodded, his expression dark. "Exactly. Whatever it is, it’s close. We need to keep moving."

Sari stirred beside them, opening her eyes with a frown. "And go where, Griffin? Deeper into the forest? What if that’s exactly what it wants us to do?"

Talon could hear the tension in her voice, the strain that had been building for days. They were all on edge, frayed from the constant threat of Metis’s forces, the endless running, and the pressure of Talon’s growing connection to the Veil. It felt like they were walking a tightrope, one wrong step away from disaster.

Griffin’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t respond immediately. His gaze remained locked on the trees. "We don’t have a choice. Staying here isn’t an option."

Talon opened his mouth to argue, but the words caught in his throat. Something moved in the darkness—just beyond the firelight, a flicker of motion too quick to fully register.

He froze, his pulse quickening as his eyes strained to see into the shadows. For a moment, everything went still again, the forest returning to its unnatural silence. But then, there it was again—closer this time, a shadow that didn’t belong, slipping between the trees with a fluidity that sent a chill down Talon’s spine.

"Griffin…" Talon whispered, his voice tight.

Griffin stopped sharpening his knife and stood, his body tense, his hand gripping the hilt of his blade. "I see it."

Sari sat up, her eyes wide with alarm as she followed their gaze into the trees. "What is it?"

"I don’t know," Griffin said, his voice barely more than a growl. "But it’s not an Eidolon."

Talon’s breath quickened as he stood slowly, his eyes locked on the spot where the shadow had disappeared. The air around them felt charged, heavy with an unseen presence, like the forest itself was holding its breath. The **cuff** on his wrist began to hum softly, the energy within it stirring in response to the threat.

Suddenly, the shadow moved again, this time darting closer, fast and fluid, slipping between the trees like a predator stalking its prey. Talon’s heart raced as he caught a brief glimpse of it—a figure, tall and lean, its limbs too long, its movements too smooth to be human. It wasn’t like the Eidolons. This was something else. Something more dangerous.

"It’s hunting us," Sari whispered, her voice trembling.

Griffin’s grip on his knife tightened, his stance low and ready. "Whatever it is, we can’t stay here. Move. Now."

Talon nodded, the hair on the back of his neck standing on end as the shadow darted between the trees again, closer this time, circling them like a wolf stalking its prey. The firelight flickered, casting eerie shapes against the ground as they scrambled to gather their things.

But before they could move, the figure stepped into the clearing.

It was tall, its body sleek and angular, its limbs impossibly long and thin. The metal of its frame was dark, gleaming faintly in the dim light of the fire. But what set it apart from the other creations of Metis were the **glowing red eyes** that seemed to pierce through the darkness, fixing on Talon with an intensity that made his blood run cold.

The **Revenant**.

It stood there, motionless, its head tilted slightly as it observed them. Talon’s breath caught in his throat, the hum of the cuff growing louder as the Revenant’s eyes locked onto him. There was intelligence in those eyes—cold, calculating intelligence. This wasn’t like the mindless drones Metis usually sent after them. This thing was aware. It was thinking.

And it was hunting.

"Move!" Griffin shouted, breaking the spell of fear that had gripped them.

Talon didn’t hesitate. He grabbed his pack and bolted, his heart pounding in his chest as he followed Griffin into the trees. Sari was right behind him, her breath coming in quick, ragged bursts as they sprinted through the underbrush. The shadows seemed to twist and warp around them as they ran, the trees blurring together in a dizzying rush.

But the Revenant was faster.

Talon could hear it behind them, moving with terrifying speed, its long limbs barely making a sound as it darted through the forest. It was closing in, its presence like a shadow creeping over them, relentless and unstoppable.

"Split up!" Griffin called out, his voice barely audible over the sound of their frantic footsteps. "It can’t follow all of us!"

Talon glanced at Sari, his mind racing. Splitting up would make them harder to track, but it also meant they’d be more vulnerable. The Revenant was fast—too fast. And it had already chosen its target.

Him.

The hum of the cuff grew louder, the power within it stirring in response to the threat. Talon’s vision blurred for a moment, the trees around him seeming to shift and bend as the Veil’s influence crept in. He stumbled but forced himself to keep running, pushing the Veil’s whispers to the back of his mind.

He didn’t have time for that now.

They burst through the treeline, the forest opening up into a rocky slope that stretched upward into the hills. Talon’s legs burned as he scrambled up the uneven ground, the sound of the Revenant’s pursuit growing louder behind him. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw it—moving effortlessly up the slope, its eyes locked on him with terrifying focus.

Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps as he pushed himself harder, his mind racing for a solution. The cuff pulsed against his skin, the energy inside it building, but he hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he could control it—not after what had happened last time.

But he was running out of options.
