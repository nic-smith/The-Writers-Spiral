**Chapter 4: The Revenant’s Hunt**

**The Revenant Appears**

The night settled around them like a suffocating blanket, heavy with the weight of unseen dangers. The fire had long since died down to embers, casting faint, flickering shadows against the twisted trunks of the trees. Talon sat with his back against a rough oak, his body tense, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond their camp. The air was still, too still, as if the forest was holding its breath.

Every sound felt amplified—the distant rustle of leaves, the soft crackling of the dying fire, the steady rhythm of his own heartbeat. But something was wrong. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched, stalked by something far more dangerous than the Eidolons they had faced before.

Sari was curled up beside him, her eyes closed but her body tense, as though sleep had eluded her too. Griffin sat a few feet away, his knife out, sharpening it with a slow, deliberate motion that cut through the silence. His face was set in a hard frown, his eyes fixed on the forest as if daring something to emerge from the shadows.

Talon’s hand moved instinctively to the cuff, feeling the cool metal against his skin. The hum was faint now, almost imperceptible, but it was still there, a constant reminder of the power that lay dormant beneath the surface. He had barely touched the cuff since their last encounter with the Eidolons. He didn’t trust it—didn’t trust what it did to him. But the weight of its presence never left him.

Griffin’s voice broke the silence, low and gruff. "We need to move at first light."

Talon glanced over at him, his mind still half-distracted by the strange sense of unease that had settled in his chest. "Move where? We don’t even know where we’re going anymore."

Griffin didn’t look up from his knife. "Away from here. This place isn’t right. Haven’t you noticed? It’s too quiet. It feels like…"

"Like something’s watching us," Talon finished, his voice barely above a whisper.

Griffin nodded, his expression dark. "Exactly. Whatever it is, it’s close. We need to keep moving."

Sari stirred beside them, opening her eyes with a frown. "And go where, Griffin? Deeper into the forest? What if that’s exactly what it wants us to do?"

Talon could hear the tension in her voice, the strain that had been building for days. They were all on edge, frayed from the constant threat of Metis’s forces, the endless running, and the pressure of Talon’s growing connection to the Veil. It felt like they were walking a tightrope, one wrong step away from disaster.

Griffin’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t respond immediately. His gaze remained locked on the trees. "We don’t have a choice. Staying here isn’t an option."

Talon opened his mouth to argue, but the words caught in his throat. Something moved in the darkness—just beyond the firelight, a flicker of motion too quick to fully register.

He froze, his pulse quickening as his eyes strained to see into the shadows. For a moment, everything went still again, the forest returning to its unnatural silence. But then, there it was again—closer this time, a shadow that didn’t belong, slipping between the trees with a fluidity that sent a chill down Talon’s spine.

"Griffin…" Talon whispered, his voice tight.

Griffin stopped sharpening his knife and stood, his body tense, his hand gripping the hilt of his blade. "I see it."

Sari sat up, her eyes wide with alarm as she followed their gaze into the trees. "What is it?"

"I don’t know," Griffin said, his voice barely more than a growl. "But it’s not an Eidolon."

Talon’s breath quickened as he stood slowly, his eyes locked on the spot where the shadow had disappeared. The air around them felt charged, heavy with an unseen presence, like the forest itself was holding its breath. The **cuff** on his wrist began to hum softly, the energy within it stirring in response to the threat.

Suddenly, the shadow moved again, this time darting closer, fast and fluid, slipping between the trees like a predator stalking its prey. Talon’s heart raced as he caught a brief glimpse of it—a figure, tall and lean, its limbs too long, its movements too smooth to be human. It wasn’t like the Eidolons. This was something else. Something more dangerous.

"It’s hunting us," Sari whispered, her voice trembling.

Griffin’s grip on his knife tightened, his stance low and ready. "Whatever it is, we can’t stay here. Move. Now."

Talon nodded, the hair on the back of his neck standing on end as the shadow darted between the trees again, closer this time, circling them like a wolf stalking its prey. The firelight flickered, casting eerie shapes against the ground as they scrambled to gather their things.

But before they could move, the figure stepped into the clearing.

It was tall, its body sleek and angular, its limbs impossibly long and thin. The metal of its frame was dark, gleaming faintly in the dim light of the fire. But what set it apart from the other creations of Metis were the **glowing red eyes** that seemed to pierce through the darkness, fixing on Talon with an intensity that made his blood run cold.

The **Revenant**.

It stood there, motionless, its head tilted slightly as it observed them. Talon’s breath caught in his throat, the hum of the cuff growing louder as the Revenant’s eyes locked onto him. There was intelligence in those eyes—cold, calculating intelligence. This wasn’t like the mindless drones Metis usually sent after them. This thing was aware. It was thinking.

And it was hunting.

"Move!" Griffin shouted, breaking the spell of fear that had gripped them.

Talon didn’t hesitate. He grabbed his pack and bolted, his heart pounding in his chest as he followed Griffin into the trees. Sari was right behind him, her breath coming in quick, ragged bursts as they sprinted through the underbrush. The shadows seemed to twist and warp around them as they ran, the trees blurring together in a dizzying rush.

But the Revenant was faster.

Talon could hear it behind them, moving with terrifying speed, its long limbs barely making a sound as it darted through the forest. It was closing in, its presence like a shadow creeping over them, relentless and unstoppable.

"Split up!" Griffin called out, his voice barely audible over the sound of their frantic footsteps. "It can’t follow all of us!"

Talon glanced at Sari, his mind racing. Splitting up would make them harder to track, but it also meant they’d be more vulnerable. The Revenant was fast—too fast. And it had already chosen its target.

Him.

The hum of the cuff grew louder, the power within it stirring in response to the threat. Talon’s vision blurred for a moment, the trees around him seeming to shift and bend as the Veil’s influence crept in. He stumbled but forced himself to keep running, pushing the Veil’s whispers to the back of his mind.

He didn’t have time for that now.

They burst through the treeline, the forest opening up into a rocky slope that stretched upward into the hills. Talon’s legs burned as he scrambled up the uneven ground, the sound of the Revenant’s pursuit growing louder behind him. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw it—moving effortlessly up the slope, its eyes locked on him with terrifying focus.

Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps as he pushed himself harder, his mind racing for a solution. The cuff pulsed against his skin, the energy inside it building, but he hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he could control it—not after what had happened last time.

But he was running out of options.

**Talon’s Struggle**

Talon’s feet pounded against the uneven ground as he raced up the rocky slope, each step feeling like a desperate push against the inevitable. The **Revenant** was gaining on him, moving with a terrifying speed that made every second feel like it was slipping away. The power in the cuff surged, its hum growing louder in his ears, almost drowning out the sound of his own frantic breathing.

He stumbled again, the ground shifting beneath his feet, but he caught himself, forcing his legs to keep moving. The air around him felt charged, like the world itself was bending under the pressure of the **Veil’s presence**. He could feel it—its power, its hunger—growing inside him, pushing at the edges of his control.

Behind him, the Revenant moved with lethal precision, its long limbs carrying it effortlessly up the slope. It didn’t need to hurry. It knew Talon was running out of time. The glowing red eyes of the machine were locked on him, and Talon could feel the weight of its gaze like a physical force, pressing down on him.

"Come on, Talon!" Griffin’s voice echoed from somewhere to his right, his figure barely visible through the trees as he pushed through the dense underbrush. "You need to move faster!"

Talon’s breath came in short, sharp gasps, his chest burning with every inhale. He couldn’t move faster. His legs were already at their limit, and the weight of the cuff was dragging him down, the hum vibrating through his entire body now. The power within it was building, and Talon knew that if he didn’t release it soon, it would tear him apart.

But he didn’t know if he could control it. Not now.

The slope grew steeper, the rocks shifting underfoot as he scrambled upward, his hands gripping the jagged edges of the terrain to pull himself higher. His mind raced, torn between the instinct to survive and the fear of what might happen if he unleashed the Veil’s power.

He could feel it stirring inside him, the whispers growing louder, more insistent.

Let go.

"No," Talon muttered under his breath, his voice strained with exhaustion. "Not yet."

But the Veil didn’t listen. The cuff pulsed, the energy inside it pushing against the barriers Talon had tried so hard to maintain. His vision blurred again, the world around him warping for just a moment—trees bending, the sky darkening, reality shifting in ways that made his stomach churn.

Talon blinked, forcing himself to focus. He couldn’t afford to lose control now. Not with the Revenant so close.

"Here!" Sari’s voice called from somewhere ahead, and Talon saw her standing on a ledge just above him, her arm outstretched. She had managed to climb higher, and for a brief moment, relief washed over him. They were going to make it.

But then the Revenant lunged.

Talon barely had time to react. The machine’s sleek, angular form shot forward, its long limbs extending with unnatural speed as it closed the distance between them. Talon felt a surge of panic, his body moving on instinct as he threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the Revenant’s outstretched arm.

He hit the ground hard, the impact knocking the wind out of him. The rocks beneath him scraped against his skin, but he forced himself to roll, gasping for air as he tried to regain his footing. The Revenant loomed over him now, its glowing red eyes locking onto his, and for a moment, time seemed to slow.

The hum of the cuff reached a fever pitch, the energy inside it surging to the surface. Talon’s vision blurred again, the world around him warping as the Veil’s power began to spill out, distorting reality in strange and unsettling ways. The trees twisted and bent, the sky flickered between light and dark, and the rocks beneath him seemed to shift, as though they were melting into the ground.

He could feel the **Veil** pressing against him, urging him to let go, to release the power it held. But Talon hesitated, his mind racing with the memory of what had happened the last time he had used the cuff’s full power—the chaos, the destruction, the loss of control.

The Revenant moved again, its long, skeletal hand reaching for him with deadly precision.

Talon didn’t have a choice.

With a ragged breath, he reached for the cuff, his fingers gripping the cold metal as he felt the power surge through him. The hum grew louder, more intense, and the world around him began to warp even further, the edges of reality bending under the weight of the Veil’s influence.

The Revenant’s hand closed in, but before it could reach him, Talon unleashed the power.

A burst of energy erupted from the cuff, a wave of raw, uncontained force that slammed into the Revenant with the force of a hurricane. The machine was thrown back, its body crashing into the rocks with a deafening impact. The ground shook beneath Talon, and the air around him crackled with the energy of the Veil.

But the moment the power was released, Talon felt himself slipping.

His vision swam, the world around him dissolving into a chaotic swirl of light and shadow. The forest flickered in and out of existence, replaced by brief flashes of the **alien city**, the towering structures looming above him, their strange symbols glowing faintly in the distance. The whispers in his mind grew louder, more insistent, filling his thoughts with promises of power and control.

But Talon couldn’t focus. His body felt heavy, his mind fragmented. The energy from the Veil was too much, overwhelming him, pulling him deeper into its influence.

He gasped for air, trying to regain control, but the power surged again, slipping further out of his grasp.

"Talon!" Sari’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and clear, grounding him for just a moment.

He blinked, his vision slowly clearing as he forced himself to focus. The world around him began to stabilize, the distortions fading, though the weight of the Veil still pressed heavily on his mind. He could feel the energy of the cuff receding, though the hum remained, a constant reminder of the power that lay just beneath the surface.

Talon looked up, his breath coming in ragged gasps, and saw the Revenant struggling to rise. The machine’s body was damaged, its sleek metal frame dented and cracked from the impact, but it was still moving, its red eyes glowing faintly as it fixed its gaze on Talon once more.

It wasn’t finished yet.

"Talon, get up!" Griffin shouted from somewhere behind him.

Talon pushed himself to his feet, his legs trembling from the effort. The power of the Veil still lingered in his mind, but he couldn’t afford to lose control again. Not with the Revenant still hunting them.

They had to keep moving.

**Escape**

Talon’s legs burned as he scrambled to his feet, every muscle in his body protesting after the surge of energy from the cuff. His vision still swam with afterimages—flashes of the alien city, strange symbols glowing faintly in the corners of his sight. But there was no time to dwell on it. The **Revenant** was already rising again, its red eyes fixed on him with a cold, calculated hunger.

"Come on!" Griffin shouted, already moving toward him, his knife gripped tightly in his hand. "We need to go now!"

Sari was already halfway up the ridge, her hand extended toward Talon, urgency etched across her face. "Talon! We can’t fight it. Not like this!"

Talon nodded, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He could feel the **Veil’s power** lingering just beneath the surface, ready to surge again if he let it. But he wasn’t sure how much more he could take. The last burst had nearly torn him apart. He couldn’t afford to lose control now—not with the Revenant so close.

He stumbled toward Sari, his body protesting every movement, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him like an anchor. The world around him still felt unstable, as if reality itself was bending beneath the weight of the Veil’s influence. The trees seemed to shift and twist in the corner of his vision, but he forced himself to focus, pushing the distortions aside.

The Revenant was on its feet now, its angular frame dented and battered from the impact, but it moved with terrifying precision, its long limbs extending as it began to climb the ridge after them. Its glowing red eyes locked onto Talon, and he could feel the weight of its gaze, cold and calculating, as it calculated its next move.

Griffin was already halfway to the top of the ridge, moving with the practiced precision of a soldier. He didn’t look back as he called out over his shoulder. "Talon, stop messing around! Move!"

Talon’s chest tightened with frustration, but there was no time for arguments. He pushed himself harder, his legs burning as he climbed the steep incline, his hands gripping the rocky surface as he hauled himself upward. Sari was just ahead, her eyes wide with fear but her movements quick and sure. She extended her hand again, and this time, Talon grabbed it, allowing her to help pull him up the last few feet.

They reached the top of the ridge, breathless and exhausted, but there was no time to stop. Below them, the Revenant was already closing the distance, its movements smooth and methodical as it climbed the slope with inhuman speed.

"It’s still coming," Sari breathed, her voice tight with fear.

Talon looked down at the Revenant, his pulse quickening as he saw the determination in its movements. It wasn’t like the other creations of Metis. This thing wasn’t just following orders—it was hunting them with purpose, with intelligence. And Talon had the sinking feeling that no matter how fast they ran, the Revenant would never stop.

"We need to split up," Griffin said, his voice low but firm. "It can’t follow all of us. We lead it in different directions—make it choose."

Sari’s eyes widened in alarm. "No! We can’t split up, Griffin. That’s exactly what it wants. If we’re separated, we’ll be vulnerable."

Griffin shook his head, his jaw set. "If we stay together, it’ll pick us off one by one. It’s smarter than the others. We can’t outfight it, but we can outthink it. We split up, confuse it, make it lose track of us."

Talon glanced between them, his heart racing. He understood Griffin’s logic, but the idea of splitting up now, when they were already being hunted, made his stomach churn. The forest was dangerous enough without the Revenant tracking them, and being alone could mean death.

But the Revenant was closing in, and they were running out of options.

"We don’t have time for this!" Griffin snapped, his voice sharp. "Talon, go west with Sari. I’ll lead it north. Don’t stop moving until you’re clear of the ridge."

Talon hesitated for a split second, his mind racing with doubts, but there was no time to argue. The Revenant was nearly at the top of the ridge now, its glowing eyes locked onto them, and the hum of the cuff was growing louder, the power inside it stirring again, as if sensing the imminent danger.

"Go!" Griffin shouted, already turning to sprint toward the north.

Talon grabbed Sari’s hand and pulled her toward the west, their feet slipping on the rocky terrain as they ran. The forest opened up before them, the trees looming tall and dark, casting long shadows across their path. The air was thick with tension, every step feeling like it could be their last.

Behind them, Talon could hear the Revenant’s mechanical limbs moving with terrifying speed, but it was hard to tell which direction it was following. He forced himself to focus, his breath coming in short, sharp bursts as they plunged deeper into the forest, the trees closing in around them.

"Do you think Griffin will be okay?" Sari asked between gasps, her voice laced with worry.

Talon didn’t answer immediately. He didn’t know if Griffin would be okay. The Revenant was fast—too fast—and Talon had seen the way it moved, the intelligence behind its eyes. It wasn’t going to stop until it had caught one of them. He just hoped Griffin was far enough away to avoid its grasp.

"We’ll regroup," Talon said finally, though his voice lacked conviction. "Once we’re clear of the ridge, we’ll find him."

Sari nodded, though Talon could see the fear in her eyes. She was trying to stay strong, but the strain was starting to show. They had been running for so long—fleeing from one danger to the next—and the weight of it was beginning to crush them.

Talon felt it too. The constant pressure. The Veil’s whispers growing louder with every step. The uncertainty of what was waiting for them in the forest ahead. And the knowledge that they couldn’t keep running forever.

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed behind them, followed by the unmistakable sound of the Revenant’s heavy footsteps. It was closer than they had thought.

"Keep moving!" Talon urged, pushing Sari forward as the trees closed in around them.

They plunged deeper into the forest, the shadows stretching longer, the air growing colder. The Revenant’s presence was still there, stalking them through the trees, but they had no choice but to keep running.

The forest seemed to twist and shift around them, the world warping under the Veil’s influence. Talon could feel the power stirring again, pressing against him, urging him to let go. But he couldn’t. Not yet.

They had to survive.
