- **Tone**: Intense and action-packed, with a feeling of dread as the group realizes they are being hunted by something far more dangerous than before.
- **Key Events**:

#### **Segment 2: Talon’s Power Surge**

- **Key Events**:
  - After narrowly escaping the Revenant, the group is forced to hide. Talon is **physically drained** from using the cuff, and the surge of power has left him disoriented.
  - **Reality warps** around him—he sees flashes of the alien world, hears whispers from the Veil, and feels as though time itself is slipping. These hallucinations are stronger than before, and he struggles to differentiate between what’s real and what isn’t.
  - **Griffin confronts Talon**, frustrated that his powers are becoming more dangerous and harder to control. He accuses Talon of putting the group at risk, creating more tension within the group.
- **Projected Word Count**: **1,000-1,500 words**.

- **Tone**: Tense and suspenseful, with a growing sense of **paranoia**. The group is fraying at the edges, unsure of how to stop the Revenant or whether they can trust each other.
- **Key Events**:
  - The group takes shelter in an abandoned building, trying to regroup and plan their next move. There is **palpable tension** between Talon and Griffin, with Sari trying to keep the peace.
  - Talon is haunted by his hallucinations and the growing **weight of the cuff**, feeling as though the Veil is pulling him closer to it. He wonders if the Veil itself is manipulating him, using his connection for its own purposes.
  - **Sari tends to Talon’s injuries**, but she grows increasingly worried about his state of mind. The group knows the Revenant is still hunting them, and the pressure of being constantly pursued is beginning to break them down emotionally.
  - The chapter ends with the Revenant reappearing on the horizon, faster and more relentless than before, leaving the group with no choice but to face it head-on in the next chapter.
- **Projected Word Count**: **1,000-1,500 words**.
