**Chapter 4: The Revenant’s Hunt**

**Escape**

Talon’s legs burned as he scrambled to his feet, every muscle in his body protesting after the surge of energy from the cuff. His vision still swam with afterimages—flashes of the alien city, strange symbols glowing faintly in the corners of his sight. But there was no time to dwell on it. The **Revenant** was already rising again, its red eyes fixed on him with a cold, calculated hunger.

"Come on!" Griffin shouted, already moving toward him, his knife gripped tightly in his hand. "We need to go now!"

Sari was already halfway up the ridge, her hand extended toward Talon, urgency etched across her face. "Talon! We can’t fight it. Not like this!"

Talon nodded, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He could feel the **Veil’s power** lingering just beneath the surface, ready to surge again if he let it. But he wasn’t sure how much more he could take. The last burst had nearly torn him apart. He couldn’t afford to lose control now—not with the Revenant so close.

He stumbled toward Sari, his body protesting every movement, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him like an anchor. The world around him still felt unstable, as if reality itself was bending beneath the weight of the Veil’s influence. The trees seemed to shift and twist in the corner of his vision, but he forced himself to focus, pushing the distortions aside.

The Revenant was on its feet now, its angular frame dented and battered from the impact, but it moved with terrifying precision, its long limbs extending as it began to climb the ridge after them. Its glowing red eyes locked onto Talon, and he could feel the weight of its gaze, cold and calculating, as it calculated its next move.

Griffin was already halfway to the top of the ridge, moving with the practiced precision of a soldier. He didn’t look back as he called out over his shoulder. "Talon, stop messing around! Move!"

Talon’s chest tightened with frustration, but there was no time for arguments. He pushed himself harder, his legs burning as he climbed the steep incline, his hands gripping the rocky surface as he hauled himself upward. Sari was just ahead, her eyes wide with fear but her movements quick and sure. She extended her hand again, and this time, Talon grabbed it, allowing her to help pull him up the last few feet.

They reached the top of the ridge, breathless and exhausted, but there was no time to stop. Below them, the Revenant was already closing the distance, its movements smooth and methodical as it climbed the slope with inhuman speed.

"It’s still coming," Sari breathed, her voice tight with fear.

Talon looked down at the Revenant, his pulse quickening as he saw the determination in its movements. It wasn’t like the other creations of Metis. This thing wasn’t just following orders—it was hunting them with purpose, with intelligence. And Talon had the sinking feeling that no matter how fast they ran, the Revenant would never stop.

"We need to split up," Griffin said, his voice low but firm. "It can’t follow all of us. We lead it in different directions—make it choose."

Sari’s eyes widened in alarm. "No! We can’t split up, Griffin. That’s exactly what it wants. If we’re separated, we’ll be vulnerable."

Griffin shook his head, his jaw set. "If we stay together, it’ll pick us off one by one. It’s smarter than the others. We can’t outfight it, but we can outthink it. We split up, confuse it, make it lose track of us."

Talon glanced between them, his heart racing. He understood Griffin’s logic, but the idea of splitting up now, when they were already being hunted, made his stomach churn. The forest was dangerous enough without the Revenant tracking them, and being alone could mean death.

But the Revenant was closing in, and they were running out of options.

"We don’t have time for this!" Griffin snapped, his voice sharp. "Talon, go west with Sari. I’ll lead it north. Don’t stop moving until you’re clear of the ridge."

Talon hesitated for a split second, his mind racing with doubts, but there was no time to argue. The Revenant was nearly at the top of the ridge now, its glowing eyes locked onto them, and the hum of the cuff was growing louder, the power inside it stirring again, as if sensing the imminent danger.

"Go!" Griffin shouted, already turning to sprint toward the north.

Talon grabbed Sari’s hand and pulled her toward the west, their feet slipping on the rocky terrain as they ran. The forest opened up before them, the trees looming tall and dark, casting long shadows across their path. The air was thick with tension, every step feeling like it could be their last.

Behind them, Talon could hear the Revenant’s mechanical limbs moving with terrifying speed, but it was hard to tell which direction it was following. He forced himself to focus, his breath coming in short, sharp bursts as they plunged deeper into the forest, the trees closing in around them.

"Do you think Griffin will be okay?" Sari asked between gasps, her voice laced with worry.

Talon didn’t answer immediately. He didn’t know if Griffin would be okay. The Revenant was fast—too fast—and Talon had seen the way it moved, the intelligence behind its eyes. It wasn’t going to stop until it had caught one of them. He just hoped Griffin was far enough away to avoid its grasp.

"We’ll regroup," Talon said finally, though his voice lacked conviction. "Once we’re clear of the ridge, we’ll find him."

Sari nodded, though Talon could see the fear in her eyes. She was trying to stay strong, but the strain was starting to show. They had been running for so long—fleeing from one danger to the next—and the weight of it was beginning to crush them.

Talon felt it too. The constant pressure. The Veil’s whispers growing louder with every step. The uncertainty of what was waiting for them in the forest ahead. And the knowledge that they couldn’t keep running forever.

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed behind them, followed by the unmistakable sound of the Revenant’s heavy footsteps. It was closer than they had thought.

"Keep moving!" Talon urged, pushing Sari forward as the trees closed in around them.

They plunged deeper into the forest, the shadows stretching longer, the air growing colder. The Revenant’s presence was still there, stalking them through the trees, but they had no choice but to keep running.

The forest seemed to twist and shift around them, the world warping under the Veil’s influence. Talon could feel the power stirring again, pressing against him, urging him to let go. But he couldn’t. Not yet.

They had to survive.
