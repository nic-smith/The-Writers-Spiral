**Chapter 4: The Revenant’s Hunt**

**Talon’s Struggle**

Talon’s feet pounded against the uneven ground as he raced up the rocky slope, each step feeling like a desperate push against the inevitable. The **Revenant** was gaining on him, moving with a terrifying speed that made every second feel like it was slipping away. The power in the cuff surged, its hum growing louder in his ears, almost drowning out the sound of his own frantic breathing.

He stumbled again, the ground shifting beneath his feet, but he caught himself, forcing his legs to keep moving. The air around him felt charged, like the world itself was bending under the pressure of the **Veil’s presence**. He could feel it—its power, its hunger—growing inside him, pushing at the edges of his control.

Behind him, the Revenant moved with lethal precision, its long limbs carrying it effortlessly up the slope. It didn’t need to hurry. It knew Talon was running out of time. The glowing red eyes of the machine were locked on him, and Talon could feel the weight of its gaze like a physical force, pressing down on him.

"Come on, Talon!" Griffin’s voice echoed from somewhere to his right, his figure barely visible through the trees as he pushed through the dense underbrush. "You need to move faster!"

Talon’s breath came in short, sharp gasps, his chest burning with every inhale. He couldn’t move faster. His legs were already at their limit, and the weight of the cuff was dragging him down, the hum vibrating through his entire body now. The power within it was building, and Talon knew that if he didn’t release it soon, it would tear him apart.

But he didn’t know if he could control it. Not now.

The slope grew steeper, the rocks shifting underfoot as he scrambled upward, his hands gripping the jagged edges of the terrain to pull himself higher. His mind raced, torn between the instinct to survive and the fear of what might happen if he unleashed the Veil’s power.

He could feel it stirring inside him, the whispers growing louder, more insistent.

Let go.

"No," Talon muttered under his breath, his voice strained with exhaustion. "Not yet."

But the Veil didn’t listen. The cuff pulsed, the energy inside it pushing against the barriers Talon had tried so hard to maintain. His vision blurred again, the world around him warping for just a moment—trees bending, the sky darkening, reality shifting in ways that made his stomach churn.

Talon blinked, forcing himself to focus. He couldn’t afford to lose control now. Not with the Revenant so close.

"Here!" Sari’s voice called from somewhere ahead, and Talon saw her standing on a ledge just above him, her arm outstretched. She had managed to climb higher, and for a brief moment, relief washed over him. They were going to make it.

But then the Revenant lunged.

Talon barely had time to react. The machine’s sleek, angular form shot forward, its long limbs extending with unnatural speed as it closed the distance between them. Talon felt a surge of panic, his body moving on instinct as he threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the Revenant’s outstretched arm.

He hit the ground hard, the impact knocking the wind out of him. The rocks beneath him scraped against his skin, but he forced himself to roll, gasping for air as he tried to regain his footing. The Revenant loomed over him now, its glowing red eyes locking onto his, and for a moment, time seemed to slow.

The hum of the cuff reached a fever pitch, the energy inside it surging to the surface. Talon’s vision blurred again, the world around him warping as the Veil’s power began to spill out, distorting reality in strange and unsettling ways. The trees twisted and bent, the sky flickered between light and dark, and the rocks beneath him seemed to shift, as though they were melting into the ground.

He could feel the **Veil** pressing against him, urging him to let go, to release the power it held. But Talon hesitated, his mind racing with the memory of what had happened the last time he had used the cuff’s full power—the chaos, the destruction, the loss of control.

The Revenant moved again, its long, skeletal hand reaching for him with deadly precision.

Talon didn’t have a choice.

With a ragged breath, he reached for the cuff, his fingers gripping the cold metal as he felt the power surge through him. The hum grew louder, more intense, and the world around him began to warp even further, the edges of reality bending under the weight of the Veil’s influence.

The Revenant’s hand closed in, but before it could reach him, Talon unleashed the power.

A burst of energy erupted from the cuff, a wave of raw, uncontained force that slammed into the Revenant with the force of a hurricane. The machine was thrown back, its body crashing into the rocks with a deafening impact. The ground shook beneath Talon, and the air around him crackled with the energy of the Veil.

But the moment the power was released, Talon felt himself slipping.

His vision swam, the world around him dissolving into a chaotic swirl of light and shadow. The forest flickered in and out of existence, replaced by brief flashes of the **alien city**, the towering structures looming above him, their strange symbols glowing faintly in the distance. The whispers in his mind grew louder, more insistent, filling his thoughts with promises of power and control.

But Talon couldn’t focus. His body felt heavy, his mind fragmented. The energy from the Veil was too much, overwhelming him, pulling him deeper into its influence.

He gasped for air, trying to regain control, but the power surged again, slipping further out of his grasp.

"Talon!" Sari’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and clear, grounding him for just a moment.

He blinked, his vision slowly clearing as he forced himself to focus. The world around him began to stabilize, the distortions fading, though the weight of the Veil still pressed heavily on his mind. He could feel the energy of the cuff receding, though the hum remained, a constant reminder of the power that lay just beneath the surface.

Talon looked up, his breath coming in ragged gasps, and saw the Revenant struggling to rise. The machine’s body was damaged, its sleek metal frame dented and cracked from the impact, but it was still moving, its red eyes glowing faintly as it fixed its gaze on Talon once more.

It wasn’t finished yet.

"Talon, get up!" Griffin shouted from somewhere behind him.

Talon pushed himself to his feet, his legs trembling from the effort. The power of the Veil still lingered in his mind, but he couldn’t afford to lose control again. Not with the Revenant still hunting them.

They had to keep moving.
