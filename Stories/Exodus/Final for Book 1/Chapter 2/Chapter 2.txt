Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil

The fog pressed in tighter, and the deeper they ventured into the forest, the more it seemed to warp around them. The air was heavy with an unnatural stillness, as though even the sounds of the night were suffocated by the weight of the Veil’s influence. Talon’s every step felt deliberate, like the ground beneath him was reluctant to let him pass, as though the forest itself were watching.

“We should stop here,” Sari said, her voice a low whisper. She had been scanning the surrounding trees, her sharp eyes searching for something—anything—that might serve as shelter. The others came to a halt, and for a moment, the silence between them was almost deafening.

Griffin sheathed his sword, his eyes narrowing as he looked around. “Feels wrong,” he muttered. “Like this place doesn’t want us here.”

Talon didn’t need to say anything. He could feel it too. There was something off about the forest. It wasn’t just the way the fog twisted or the unnatural shapes in the shadows. It was deeper than that, a feeling that gnawed at the back of his mind, pulling him toward the medallion around his neck. The power within it hummed faintly, as if it could sense something approaching, but Talon couldn’t be sure if it was the Veil or his own paranoia that was speaking to him.

Sari, always the calm one, moved closer to him. “We need to rest, Talon,” she said quietly. “We’re no good to each other if we’re exhausted.”

Talon nodded, though his gaze lingered on the twisted trees. He could barely make out their outlines through the thick fog, but their presence loomed over him like dark sentinels, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. He couldn’t shake the feeling that the forest was more alive than it should be.

“We’ll rest,” Talon agreed, his voice quieter than he intended. He felt the medallion’s weight against his chest, heavier than before. It was always heavier in places like this, where the Veil seemed to creep closer. He hadn’t used it since the last confrontation, but its influence was always there, lurking just beneath the surface.

Griffin huffed, clearly uneasy with the decision. “I’ll take first watch,” he said, his eyes still scanning the area. “I don’t trust this place.”

No one argued with him. They all felt it—the wrongness in the air, the way the world seemed to bend ever so slightly, as if reality itself was twisted by some unseen force. Even the trees, with their twisted branches and gnarled roots, seemed to pulse with the dark energy that surrounded them.

Talon lowered himself to the ground, his muscles aching from days of running and fighting. He glanced at the others—Sari had settled beside him, her face drawn with exhaustion, but her eyes were still sharp, still alert. Griffin, true to his word, had stationed himself a few paces away, sword in hand, his gaze fixed on the trees. Even when he was still, Griffin radiated a quiet tension, like a coiled spring ready to snap.

Talon shifted uncomfortably. The weight of the medallion felt suffocating now, its cold metal pressing against his chest, as though it had become a part of him. He hadn’t used it again, not since the fight with the Eidolons, but the temptation was always there. In places like this, where the Veil’s influence seemed strongest, the medallion felt alive. It whispered to him, a constant, nagging presence in the back of his mind.

As he leaned back against the base of a tree, Talon closed his eyes, trying to block out the feeling. But the moment he let his guard down, the whispers came louder, more insistent. They were still unintelligible—faint, cryptic words that seemed to pull at his thoughts, dragging him deeper into the medallion’s influence. His skin prickled, and he could feel the glyphs on his arms burning faintly beneath his sleeves, a reminder of the power he had barely begun to understand.

“Talon?”

Sari’s voice broke through the fog of his thoughts, pulling him back to the present. Her eyes were on him, filled with concern. “You okay?”

Talon blinked, his breath catching in his throat. He nodded, though he wasn’t sure if he was convincing her or himself. “I’m fine,” he said, though his voice was tight. The medallion hummed against his chest, its presence undeniable, but he forced the thoughts away. Not now. Not while they were exposed.

Sari didn’t push, but she didn’t look convinced either. She leaned back, her gaze shifting toward the fog. “Do you hear that?”

Talon strained his ears, but there was nothing. No sound of wind through the trees, no rustling leaves—just silence, thick and oppressive. It made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. “No,” he replied slowly. “I don’t hear anything.”

“That’s the problem,” Sari said, her voice barely above a whisper. “There’s nothing. No birds, no animals… it’s like the forest is holding its breath.”

Talon’s hand twitched toward the medallion. He knew he shouldn’t. He knew it was dangerous, but the silence unnerved him. He could feel the Veil pressing in closer, tightening around them, and the medallion seemed to pulse in response, as if it knew something he didn’t.

The temptation was there, gnawing at him, but Talon pushed it down. Not yet. He couldn’t give in. Not again.

But the Veil was waiting. He could feel it.

Talon sat in the stillness, his pulse quickening as the silence stretched on. Sari was right—there was something unnerving about the absence of sound, like the forest itself had drawn back, leaving them stranded in some forsaken pocket of reality. It wasn’t just the quiet; it was the way the shadows seemed to cling to everything, thick and heavy, as though they were alive.

Griffin’s voice broke the silence. “This isn’t right. We need to move.”

He was standing now, his hand clenched tightly around the hilt of his sword, knuckles white from the tension. His eyes scanned the trees, but Talon could see the flicker of fear behind his steady gaze. Griffin wasn’t one to show fear, not easily, but the stillness of the forest was unsettling all of them.

Talon glanced at Sari. She hadn’t moved, but her expression mirrored Griffin’s unease. She was trying to stay calm, but there was a tension in the way she held herself, as though she were waiting for something—some invisible danger to leap from the shadows.

“We can’t just keep running,” Talon said, his voice a little rougher than he intended. “We’re all exhausted. If we move now and run into another ambush—” He didn’t finish the sentence. They all knew how it would end.

Griffin frowned, his jaw tightening. “And if we stay here? What then?”

Talon didn’t have an answer for that. The forest felt wrong. There was something off about the air, about the way the fog shifted, the way the trees seemed to lean toward them as though listening. It wasn’t just dangerous—it was unnatural.

Before he could speak, something stirred in the distance.

At first, it was barely noticeable—a faint rustling, as though a breeze had finally swept through the forest. But there was no wind, and the sound wasn’t right. It was too deliberate, too slow. Talon’s breath caught in his throat as he strained his ears, trying to catch it again.

Then he heard it—a faint whisper, like voices carried on the wind, too soft to understand but unmistakable.

Sari shot to her feet, her eyes wide. “Do you hear that?”

Talon nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. The whispers were faint but growing louder, like they were moving closer. His hand instinctively went to the medallion. It felt cold, colder than before, and its weight seemed to pull at him with a new urgency. The glyphs on his skin tingled, as though they were coming alive.

Griffin’s hand was already on his sword. “Stay alert.”

The fog seemed to thicken, pressing in on them from all sides. The whispering grew louder, but the words were still indistinguishable, a low murmur that sent a chill down Talon’s spine. He could feel the medallion pulsing in time with the whispers, its cold energy seeping into him, tugging at the edges of his mind.

“Something’s out there,” Sari whispered, her voice tight with fear. She drew her daggers, her eyes darting between the shadows. “I can feel it.”

Talon’s mind raced. The Veil’s presence was stronger here—he could feel it in his bones, in the way the air seemed to vibrate with unseen power. The medallion was reacting, feeding off the energy, but he didn’t know if it was a warning or something worse. The whispers… they sounded familiar, but wrong, twisted. They weren’t just coming from the forest. They were inside him.

He swallowed hard, his fingers brushing against the medallion. The cold bite of the metal sent a shock through him, and for a moment, he felt the world tilt. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, until they were no longer just a faint murmur. They were clear.

“Talon…”

He froze.

It wasn’t just whispers anymore. The voice had said his name.

Sari noticed his reaction immediately, her eyes snapping to him. “What is it? What’s wrong?”

Talon shook his head, trying to clear the fog that seemed to cloud his mind. “The voice,” he muttered, barely able to form the words. “It said my name.”

Griffin’s gaze darkened, his grip tightening on his sword. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, his voice shaking. “But it’s not just the forest. It’s something else—something inside the Veil.”

The whispers were louder now, circling them like a predator, their tone shifting from soft murmurings to something more urgent, more dangerous. The fog swirled around them, and the shadows seemed to close in. Talon could feel the medallion vibrating against his chest, and the glyphs on his skin flared to life, burning with a searing heat.

“Talon…” The voice came again, stronger this time, clearer. It felt like it was inside his head, digging into his thoughts, pulling him deeper into the Veil’s grasp.

He stumbled back, his hands going to his temples as the pain shot through him. The world spun, the trees blurring into twisted, dark shapes. The whispers turned into a roar, and the ground beneath his feet seemed to ripple like water.

Sari rushed to his side, her hands gripping his shoulders. “Talon, stay with me! What’s happening?”

“I—” Talon gasped, his voice barely a whisper. “I can’t—” The medallion’s power was overwhelming him, filling his mind with visions of alien landscapes and ancient ruins, places he couldn’t name but somehow knew were tied to the Veil. The glyphs burned brighter, the heat spreading through his body like fire.

Griffin stepped forward, his expression a mix of fear and anger. “Talon, snap out of it! We don’t have time for this!”

Talon tried to fight it, tried to push the medallion’s influence away, but the pull was too strong. The voice was relentless, calling him deeper, demanding something from him, but he didn’t know what. His vision blurred, and for a moment, the world around him dissolved into the swirling fog of the Veil.

“Talon…” the voice whispered again, softer this time, but more urgent.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the whispers stopped.

The forest was silent once more.

Talon collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath. The medallion was still warm against his chest, but the glyphs had dimmed, their glow fading. The fog still clung to the trees, but the oppressive weight of the Veil had lessened, leaving only the eerie stillness in its wake.

Sari knelt beside him, her hands still on his shoulders. “Talon, are you okay?”

He nodded weakly, though his body trembled. The voice, the whispers… they had felt too real, too close. And worse than that, they had felt like a warning.

Griffin stood over them, his jaw tight, his eyes narrowed. “What the hell was that?”

Talon didn’t have an answer. He didn’t know what it was or what the Veil wanted from him. But the fear that had taken hold of him refused to let go. The medallion’s power was growing stronger, and with it, the Veil’s hold on him.

And this time, he wasn’t sure he could fight it.

The silence in the forest felt like it was waiting for something—a pause before the storm. Talon’s breaths came in shallow gasps as he struggled to regain his composure, the weight of the medallion pressing hard against his chest. The glyphs on his skin still tingled with the faint aftershock of power, but the whispers had gone quiet. Whatever had reached out to him through the Veil had retreated—for now.

Griffin’s voice cut through the stillness like a blade. “You’ve got to get a handle on that thing, Talon.” His tone wasn’t angry this time—it was cold. “Next time, we might not be here to pull you back.”

Talon pushed himself up, his limbs shaky. “I didn’t ask for this.”

“No,” Griffin replied, his gaze hard. “But you’re the one wearing that medallion. And whether you like it or not, it’s changing you.”

Sari, still kneeling beside Talon, shot Griffin a sharp look. “This isn’t helping. He needs time to recover, not a lecture.”

Griffin opened his mouth to argue, but then shut it, shaking his head. “Fine,” he muttered, turning away to scan the tree line again. “But we can’t afford to wait here much longer. Whatever that was, it’s not going to leave us alone for long.”

Sari helped Talon to his feet, her touch gentle but firm. “Ignore him,” she said quietly, her eyes soft with concern. “You’re okay. Just breathe.”

Talon nodded, though his heart still raced. The whispers… the way they had called his name, the way the medallion had pulsed with such force—it wasn’t something he could shake easily. The Veil was reaching out to him, its tendrils wrapping tighter around his mind with every step they took deeper into this cursed forest. And the worst part was that a small, dangerous part of him wanted to listen. Wanted to know what the Veil was trying to show him.

He pushed the thought away as best he could. This was no time to lose control. Not with Sari and Griffin depending on him. Not with the Eidolons out there, hunting them.

“We’ll keep moving,” Talon said finally, his voice steadier than he felt. “But we need to be careful. The Veil’s influence is getting stronger the deeper we go.”

Griffin glanced over his shoulder, his expression grim. “You don’t need to tell me twice.”

Sari picked up her pack and handed Talon his, her eyes still searching his face for any sign of lingering distress. “Are you sure you’re okay?” she asked softly.

Talon forced a smile, though it felt hollow. “I’m fine.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t push further. Instead, she adjusted her daggers and nodded toward the path ahead. “Let’s get moving then. The sooner we’re out of this place, the better.”

The trio set off again, their footsteps muted by the dense fog that seemed to cling to the ground like a living thing. The forest was darker now, the shadows longer, the shapes in the mist more menacing. Every branch, every rustle of leaves felt like a threat. Talon could feel the Veil pressing in on him, a constant weight that clouded his thoughts and made every step feel like a struggle.

As they moved deeper into the forest, the trees grew more twisted, their bark gnarled and blackened as though burned by some unseen force. The ground became uneven, forcing them to navigate carefully around roots that jutted out like claws, ready to trip them at any moment.

It wasn’t long before the whispers started again.

At first, they were faint, barely noticeable over the sound of their footsteps. But as they pressed on, the voices grew louder, more persistent. This time, they didn’t just whisper Talon’s name—they spoke in strange, fragmented sentences, their words overlapping and bleeding into each other until it became a chaotic, maddening noise in his head.

“Talon… the path… chosen…”

He winced, trying to shake the voices loose, but they clung to him like vines, wrapping tighter around his mind.

“Do you hear that?” Sari whispered, her hand resting on one of her daggers as her eyes darted through the trees.

Talon hesitated, unsure of how to answer. The voices weren’t just in the forest—they were in him. He could feel their presence like a dark fog seeping into his thoughts, pushing against the edges of his sanity.

Griffin stopped, his sword already in hand. “I don’t like this,” he muttered. “We’re walking right into something.”

The whispers grew louder, more urgent.

“Follow… the light… find the truth…”

Talon stumbled, clutching his head as the voices pressed harder. The medallion burned against his chest, the glyphs on his skin flaring with heat once again. He could feel the power inside it—no longer dormant, but awake, alive, and pulsing with energy.

Sari rushed to his side, her hand on his arm. “Talon, what’s happening? What do you hear?”

“It’s the Veil,” Talon gasped, his voice shaking. “It’s… talking to me. I don’t know what it wants, but it won’t stop.”

Griffin turned, his face hardening. “Then we destroy it. Whatever’s talking to you, we cut it down. Simple.”

“It’s not that simple,” Sari snapped. “If it’s the Veil, we don’t know what we’re dealing with. Charging in blindly will get us all killed.”

Griffin gritted his teeth, his hand tightening on his sword. “Then what? We just stand here and let it mess with his head?”

Talon barely heard them. The voices were too loud now, filling every corner of his mind with their insistent, fragmented whispers. His vision blurred, the world around him flickering in and out of focus. He could see glimpses of something else—something beyond the trees, beyond the fog. Ancient structures, towering ruins covered in the same glowing glyphs that burned on his skin. 

And there, in the center of it all, a figure—draped in shadow, watching him. 

“Talon… come… find the light…”

He gasped, the image searing itself into his mind as the medallion pulsed violently against his chest. His knees buckled, and he fell to the ground, clutching the medallion with both hands, trying to hold back the flood of power that threatened to overwhelm him.

Sari was at his side in an instant, her voice frantic. “Talon, what’s happening? Talk to me!”

“I… I saw something,” Talon whispered, his voice barely audible over the roaring in his head. “The Veil… it’s showing me something.”

Griffin stepped closer, his sword raised defensively as he scanned the trees. “What did you see?”

Talon struggled to find the words, his mind still reeling from the vision. “Ruins… ancient… something’s waiting for us. It wants us to follow.”

Sari’s eyes widened, but Griffin’s expression darkened. “And you think we should just… follow it?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, his voice trembling. “But the Veil is pulling us toward something. If we don’t figure out what it wants, it won’t let us go.”

Griffin cursed under his breath, his frustration evident. “So, what? We walk right into its trap?”

Sari looked at Talon, her expression conflicted. “We don’t have a choice. The Veil is getting stronger. If we don’t confront it, it’ll keep coming for us.”

Talon took a deep breath, the weight of the medallion still heavy on his chest. The Veil had shown him something—something important. But whether it was a warning or a lure, he couldn’t tell. All he knew was that they had no other option.

“We go,” he said quietly, meeting their eyes. “We find out what it wants. And we survive.”
