Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil

The fog pressed in tighter, and the deeper they ventured into the forest, the more it seemed to warp around them. The air was heavy with an unnatural stillness, as though even the sounds of the night were suffocated by the weight of the Veil’s influence. Talon’s every step felt deliberate, like the ground beneath him was reluctant to let him pass, as though the forest itself were watching.

“We should stop here,” Sari said, her voice a low whisper. She had been scanning the surrounding trees, her sharp eyes searching for something—anything—that might serve as shelter. The others came to a halt, and for a moment, the silence between them was almost deafening.

Griffin sheathed his sword, his eyes narrowing as he looked around. “Feels wrong,” he muttered. “Like this place doesn’t want us here.”

Talon didn’t need to say anything. He could feel it too. There was something off about the forest. It wasn’t just the way the fog twisted or the unnatural shapes in the shadows. It was deeper than that, a feeling that gnawed at the back of his mind, pulling him toward the medallion around his neck. The power within it hummed faintly, as if it could sense something approaching, but Talon couldn’t be sure if it was the Veil or his own paranoia that was speaking to him.

Sari, always the calm one, moved closer to him. “We need to rest, Talon,” she said quietly. “We’re no good to each other if we’re exhausted.”

Talon nodded, though his gaze lingered on the twisted trees. He could barely make out their outlines through the thick fog, but their presence loomed over him like dark sentinels, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. He couldn’t shake the feeling that the forest was more alive than it should be.

“We’ll rest,” Talon agreed, his voice quieter than he intended. He felt the medallion’s weight against his chest, heavier than before. It was always heavier in places like this, where the Veil seemed to creep closer. He hadn’t used it since the last confrontation, but its influence was always there, lurking just beneath the surface.

Griffin huffed, clearly uneasy with the decision. “I’ll take first watch,” he said, his eyes still scanning the area. “I don’t trust this place.”

No one argued with him. They all felt it—the wrongness in the air, the way the world seemed to bend ever so slightly, as if reality itself was twisted by some unseen force. Even the trees, with their twisted branches and gnarled roots, seemed to pulse with the dark energy that surrounded them.

Talon lowered himself to the ground, his muscles aching from days of running and fighting. He glanced at the others—Sari had settled beside him, her face drawn with exhaustion, but her eyes were still sharp, still alert. Griffin, true to his word, had stationed himself a few paces away, sword in hand, his gaze fixed on the trees. Even when he was still, Griffin radiated a quiet tension, like a coiled spring ready to snap.

Talon shifted uncomfortably. The weight of the medallion felt suffocating now, its cold metal pressing against his chest, as though it had become a part of him. He hadn’t used it again, not since the fight with the Eidolons, but the temptation was always there. In places like this, where the Veil’s influence seemed strongest, the medallion felt alive. It whispered to him, a constant, nagging presence in the back of his mind.

As he leaned back against the base of a tree, Talon closed his eyes, trying to block out the feeling. But the moment he let his guard down, the whispers came louder, more insistent. They were still unintelligible—faint, cryptic words that seemed to pull at his thoughts, dragging him deeper into the medallion’s influence. His skin prickled, and he could feel the glyphs on his arms burning faintly beneath his sleeves, a reminder of the power he had barely begun to understand.

“Talon?”

Sari’s voice broke through the fog of his thoughts, pulling him back to the present. Her eyes were on him, filled with concern. “You okay?”

Talon blinked, his breath catching in his throat. He nodded, though he wasn’t sure if he was convincing her or himself. “I’m fine,” he said, though his voice was tight. The medallion hummed against his chest, its presence undeniable, but he forced the thoughts away. Not now. Not while they were exposed.

Sari didn’t push, but she didn’t look convinced either. She leaned back, her gaze shifting toward the fog. “Do you hear that?”

Talon strained his ears, but there was nothing. No sound of wind through the trees, no rustling leaves—just silence, thick and oppressive. It made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. “No,” he replied slowly. “I don’t hear anything.”

“That’s the problem,” Sari said, her voice barely above a whisper. “There’s nothing. No birds, no animals… it’s like the forest is holding its breath.”

Talon’s hand twitched toward the medallion. He knew he shouldn’t. He knew it was dangerous, but the silence unnerved him. He could feel the Veil pressing in closer, tightening around them, and the medallion seemed to pulse in response, as if it knew something he didn’t.

The temptation was there, gnawing at him, but Talon pushed it down. Not yet. He couldn’t give in. Not again.

But the Veil was waiting. He could feel it.
