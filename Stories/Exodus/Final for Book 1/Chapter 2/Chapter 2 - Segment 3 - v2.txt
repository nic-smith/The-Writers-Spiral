Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil

The silence in the forest felt like it was waiting for something—a pause before the storm. Talon’s breaths came in shallow gasps as he struggled to regain his composure, the weight of the medallion pressing hard against his chest. The glyphs on his skin still tingled with the faint aftershock of power, but the whispers had gone quiet. Whatever had reached out to him through the Veil had retreated—for now.

Griffin’s voice cut through the stillness like a blade. “You’ve got to get a handle on that thing, Talon.” His tone wasn’t angry this time—it was cold. “Next time, we might not be here to pull you back.”

Talon pushed himself up, his limbs shaky. “I didn’t ask for this.”

“No,” Griffin replied, his gaze hard. “But you’re the one wearing that medallion. And whether you like it or not, it’s changing you.”

Sari, still kneeling beside Talon, shot Griffin a sharp look. “This isn’t helping. He needs time to recover, not a lecture.”

Griffin opened his mouth to argue, but then shut it, shaking his head. “Fine,” he muttered, turning away to scan the tree line again. “But we can’t afford to wait here much longer. Whatever that was, it’s not going to leave us alone for long.”

Sari helped Talon to his feet, her touch gentle but firm. “Ignore him,” she said quietly, her eyes soft with concern. “You’re okay. Just breathe.”

Talon nodded, though his heart still raced. The whispers… the way they had called his name, the way the medallion had pulsed with such force—it wasn’t something he could shake easily. The Veil was reaching out to him, its tendrils wrapping tighter around his mind with every step they took deeper into this cursed forest. And the worst part was that a small, dangerous part of him wanted to listen. Wanted to know what the Veil was trying to show him.

He pushed the thought away as best he could. This was no time to lose control. Not with Sari and Griffin depending on him. Not with the Eidolons out there, hunting them.

“We’ll keep moving,” Talon said finally, his voice steadier than he felt. “But we need to be careful. The Veil’s influence is getting stronger the deeper we go.”

Griffin glanced over his shoulder, his expression grim. “You don’t need to tell me twice.”

Sari picked up her pack and handed Talon his, her eyes still searching his face for any sign of lingering distress. “Are you sure you’re okay?” she asked softly.

Talon forced a smile, though it felt hollow. “I’m fine.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t push further. Instead, she adjusted her daggers and nodded toward the path ahead. “Let’s get moving then. The sooner we’re out of this place, the better.”

The trio set off again, their footsteps muted by the dense fog that seemed to cling to the ground like a living thing. The forest was darker now, the shadows longer, the shapes in the mist more menacing. Every branch, every rustle of leaves felt like a threat. Talon could feel the Veil pressing in on him, a constant weight that clouded his thoughts and made every step feel like a struggle.

As they moved deeper into the forest, the trees grew more twisted, their bark gnarled and blackened as though burned by some unseen force. The ground became uneven, forcing them to navigate carefully around roots that jutted out like claws, ready to trip them at any moment.

It wasn’t long before the whispers started again.

At first, they were faint, barely noticeable over the sound of their footsteps. But as they pressed on, the voices grew louder, more persistent. This time, they didn’t just whisper Talon’s name—they spoke in strange, fragmented sentences, their words overlapping and bleeding into each other until it became a chaotic, maddening noise in his head.

“Talon… the path… chosen…”

He winced, trying to shake the voices loose, but they clung to him like vines, wrapping tighter around his mind.

“Do you hear that?” Sari whispered, her hand resting on one of her daggers as her eyes darted through the trees.

Talon hesitated, unsure of how to answer. The voices weren’t just in the forest—they were in him. He could feel their presence like a dark fog seeping into his thoughts, pushing against the edges of his sanity.

Griffin stopped, his sword already in hand. “I don’t like this,” he muttered. “We’re walking right into something.”

The whispers grew louder, more urgent.

“Follow… the light… find the truth…”

Talon stumbled, clutching his head as the voices pressed harder. The medallion burned against his chest, the glyphs on his skin flaring with heat once again. He could feel the power inside it—no longer dormant, but awake, alive, and pulsing with energy.

Sari rushed to his side, her hand on his arm. “Talon, what’s happening? What do you hear?”

“It’s the Veil,” Talon gasped, his voice shaking. “It’s… talking to me. I don’t know what it wants, but it won’t stop.”

Griffin turned, his face hardening. “Then we destroy it. Whatever’s talking to you, we cut it down. Simple.”

“It’s not that simple,” Sari snapped. “If it’s the Veil, we don’t know what we’re dealing with. Charging in blindly will get us all killed.”

Griffin gritted his teeth, his hand tightening on his sword. “Then what? We just stand here and let it mess with his head?”

Talon barely heard them. The voices were too loud now, filling every corner of his mind with their insistent, fragmented whispers. His vision blurred, the world around him flickering in and out of focus. He could see glimpses of something else—something beyond the trees, beyond the fog. Ancient structures, towering ruins covered in the same glowing glyphs that burned on his skin. 

And there, in the center of it all, a figure—draped in shadow, watching him. 

“Talon… come… find the light…”

He gasped, the image searing itself into his mind as the medallion pulsed violently against his chest. His knees buckled, and he fell to the ground, clutching the medallion with both hands, trying to hold back the flood of power that threatened to overwhelm him.

Sari was at his side in an instant, her voice frantic. “Talon, what’s happening? Talk to me!”

“I… I saw something,” Talon whispered, his voice barely audible over the roaring in his head. “The Veil… it’s showing me something.”

Griffin stepped closer, his sword raised defensively as he scanned the trees. “What did you see?”

Talon struggled to find the words, his mind still reeling from the vision. “Ruins… ancient… something’s waiting for us. It wants us to follow.”

Sari’s eyes widened, but Griffin’s expression darkened. “And you think we should just… follow it?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, his voice trembling. “But the Veil is pulling us toward something. If we don’t figure out what it wants, it won’t let us go.”

Griffin cursed under his breath, his frustration evident. “So, what? We walk right into its trap?”

Sari looked at Talon, her expression conflicted. “We don’t have a choice. The Veil is getting stronger. If we don’t confront it, it’ll keep coming for us.”

Talon took a deep breath, the weight of the medallion still heavy on his chest. The Veil had shown him something—something important. But whether it was a warning or a lure, he couldn’t tell. All he knew was that they had no other option.

“We go,” he said quietly, meeting their eyes. “We find out what it wants. And we survive.”
