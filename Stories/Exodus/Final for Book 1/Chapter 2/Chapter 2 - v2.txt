Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil

The air grew heavier as the group trudged deeper into the forest. The once-familiar paths twisted in on themselves, transforming into a labyrinth of gnarled trees and dense fog. Talon could feel it—the Veil’s influence creeping into every crevice of the world around them, warping the land, distorting reality. Every step felt more uncertain, as though the ground beneath them might give way at any moment.

“We’re being watched,” Griffin muttered, his hand never leaving the hilt of his sword. His eyes darted toward the shadows that seemed to slither between the trees, never staying in one place long enough to be truly seen.

Sari glanced around, her brows furrowed in concentration. “I can feel it too,” she said quietly. “But it’s not just the Eidolons. It’s... something else.”

Talon stayed silent, the weight of the medallion pressing against his chest like a lead anchor. The whispers were back, faint but insistent, like a distant voice calling out from the depths of his mind. He tried to ignore them, to push them aside, but it was getting harder. Every time he used the medallion, its pull became stronger, more persuasive. The Veil was inside him now, its tendrils coiled around his thoughts, waiting for him to give in.

The trees rustled around them, a soft breeze sending shivers through the leaves. But there was something off about it, something unnatural. The sound was too deliberate, as if the forest itself was aware of their presence.

“We need to stop for a moment,” Sari said, her voice firm. She crouched down, examining the map they had scavenged days earlier. The inked lines were smudged and worn, barely legible after weeks of being shoved in and out of packs. “We’re close to the river, but it’s hard to tell how far we’ve veered off course.”

Griffin sighed, clearly irritated but doing his best to keep his cool. “The forest is playing tricks on us. I’ve never seen it like this.”

“It’s the Veil,” Talon whispered, more to himself than to the others. “It’s warping everything. The deeper we go, the worse it gets.”

Sari looked up, her eyes locking onto Talon’s for a brief moment. “We knew this would happen,” she said. “The closer we get to the heart of it, the more reality bends.”

Talon nodded but said nothing. The weight of responsibility was crushing him, heavier than he had imagined. The medallion wasn’t just a tool—it was a living entity, and it was slowly consuming him. He could feel it, growing inside him like a parasite, feeding off his fear, his doubts, his anger.

Griffin’s voice cut through his thoughts. “If the Veil’s messing with us, then we can’t afford to stop for long. We should keep moving before the Eidolons catch up.”

Sari straightened up, folding the map with careful precision. “We’ll move quickly. The river should be just a little farther. If we can cross it, we might be able to shake off whatever’s following us.”

Talon could feel Griffin’s eyes on him, sharp with suspicion. Since the bear attack, the tension between them had been palpable, simmering just beneath the surface. Talon knew Griffin was waiting for him to slip up, to give in to the medallion’s power again. He didn’t blame him. He was waiting for it too.

As they pressed on, the whispers grew louder. The medallion pulsed against Talon’s chest, sending waves of heat through his skin. His vision flickered for a moment, the edges of reality blurring, shifting. He blinked hard, trying to clear his head, but the sensation lingered, like a shadow creeping at the corner of his mind.

“Talon,” Sari said softly, falling into step beside him. “Are you okay?”

He forced a smile, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “I’m fine.”

She gave him a look that told him she didn’t believe him, but she didn’t push. “We’ll figure it out. The Seer will help us.”

Talon nodded again, but the doubt gnawed at him. Would the Seer even have the answers they needed? Or was it already too late?

Ahead of them, the sound of rushing water broke through the oppressive silence. The river. Relief washed over Talon for a brief moment. Maybe, just maybe, they would catch a break. Maybe the forest would stop playing tricks on them, and they could find a moment of peace.

But deep down, Talon knew better. The Veil wasn’t done with them yet.

As they reached the riverbank, Sari motioned for them to stop. The water rushed by, fast and deep, the current strong enough to sweep away anything in its path. Rocks jutted out from the riverbed, slick and treacherous. 

“We can cross here,” Sari said, pointing to a series of large rocks that formed a rough path across the water. “But we need to be careful. One wrong step, and we’re in trouble.”

Griffin eyed the rocks warily. “Let’s hope the Veil doesn’t decide to shift reality while we’re halfway across.”

Talon didn’t respond, but the thought had already crossed his mind. The Veil was unpredictable. It could warp reality at any moment, turn a simple crossing into a deadly trap.

They moved slowly, one by one, stepping carefully onto the rocks. The water roared around them, spraying mist into the air. Talon could feel the medallion’s pulse quicken as he balanced on the slick stones, its whispers growing more urgent. It wanted him to use its power, to tap into the Veil’s strength and bend the world to his will.

But he resisted. He had to.

Halfway across, the air shifted. A low rumble echoed through the forest, followed by the faintest whisper of movement in the trees. Talon froze, his heart pounding.

The Veil was watching.

The rumble grew louder, vibrating through the stones beneath their feet. Talon glanced back toward Sari and Griffin, both of them standing frozen on the rocks, eyes wide as they scanned the trees. The forest had gone still again, as if holding its breath. 

Then, without warning, the fog around them thickened, swirling like a living thing, wrapping itself around the trees, distorting the world once more. Talon blinked, trying to clear his vision, but the fog seemed to cling to his mind as much as to his skin. 

The Veil. It was twisting everything again.

“Talon!” Griffin’s voice cut through the haze, sharp and urgent.

Talon spun around, just in time to see Griffin stumble on the rocks. His foot slipped, and he lurched forward, his arms flailing as he tried to regain his balance. 

Instinctively, Talon reached out with his power, feeling the medallion’s pulse align with his heartbeat. He could stop Griffin from falling—bend the world around him, slow time, prevent the disaster from happening. The medallion was offering him the control he so desperately craved.

But just as the thought flashed through his mind, Talon pulled back. 

No.

He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t let the medallion take over, not again. Not when he had promised himself he would resist. Not after everything they’d been through.

Griffin stumbled, his foot slipping off the edge of the rock. He landed hard on his side, his body half-submerged in the rushing water. Sari rushed forward, grabbing his arm and pulling him back onto the rocks, her muscles straining against the force of the current.

“Griffin!” she shouted, her voice barely audible over the roar of the river.

Griffin coughed, gasping for air as he tried to regain his footing. He looked up at Talon, his eyes dark with suspicion. “Why didn’t you—”

Sari cut him off, her voice sharp. “We don’t have time for this. Get up. We need to keep moving.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing. With Sari’s help, he dragged himself to his feet, his clothes soaked through, his skin pale from the cold water.

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, the medallion’s whispers still echoing in his mind. He had resisted. He had chosen not to use the power. But at what cost? Griffin had seen his hesitation, and now the trust between them was fraying even more.

Sari led the way across the remaining rocks, her steps cautious but quick. Talon followed, his gaze fixed on the forest ahead, trying to push the medallion’s influence out of his mind. He could feel Griffin’s eyes on him the entire time, a heavy weight that pressed down on him with every step.

As they reached the other side of the river, the ground beneath their feet felt more stable, but the tension between them remained thick. The forest was still, too still, as if it was waiting for something to happen.

“We need to find shelter,” Sari said, her voice low. “It’s not safe out here.”

Griffin grunted, his gaze fixed on Talon. “You’re right. It’s not.”

Talon’s fists clenched at his sides, anger bubbling up inside him. He had resisted the medallion’s pull, done exactly what Griffin had wanted, and still, it wasn’t enough. No matter what he did, Griffin’s distrust seemed to grow.

Sari stepped between them, her eyes flicking from one to the other. “Now’s not the time for this. We need to stay focused. The Veil is warping everything around us. We have to keep our heads clear.”

Talon forced himself to take a deep breath, his jaw tightening as he shoved his anger back down. She was right. Now wasn’t the time for a fight. Not when the forest itself seemed to be conspiring against them.

But as they moved deeper into the woods, Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that the real fight was just beginning. The Veil’s influence was growing stronger, and it was only a matter of time before it tore them apart from the inside. 

Ahead, the fog seemed to part for just a moment, revealing a small clearing surrounded by twisted trees. The ground was uneven, littered with fallen branches and decaying leaves, but it would have to do.

“We’ll rest here,” Sari said, her tone firm. “Griffin, you check the perimeter. Talon, help me set up camp.”

Griffin nodded curtly, his gaze lingering on Talon for just a moment before he turned and disappeared into the trees.

Talon dropped his pack onto the ground, his muscles aching from the day’s journey. He could feel the weight of the medallion pressing against his chest, heavier than ever. The whispers had grown faint again, but they were still there, lurking in the back of his mind, waiting for their chance to strike.

Sari worked silently beside him, her movements efficient as she unpacked their supplies and set up a makeshift shelter. Talon watched her for a moment, his chest tightening with guilt. She was trying so hard to keep them all together, to hold the fragile threads of their group intact. And yet, the rift between him and Griffin seemed to grow wider with every step they took.

Finally, Sari glanced up at him, her eyes soft but determined. “Talon... we’ll figure this out. You’re not alone in this.”

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure he believed her. The medallion was changing him, and he could feel it—warping his thoughts, twisting his emotions. And no matter how hard he tried to resist, it was always there, waiting for him to give in.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the clearing, Talon knew one thing for certain: the longer they stayed in the forest, the more dangerous it would become.

For all of them.

The night was colder than Talon had expected, the chill seeping through his clothes and settling deep into his bones. He sat by the small fire they had managed to coax from the damp wood, his eyes locked on the flickering flames. The forest around them was still shrouded in a thick fog, the trees looming like silent sentinels, their gnarled branches twisting unnaturally in the dim light.

Sari was sitting across from him, her face illuminated by the soft glow of the fire. She had barely spoken since they set up camp, her eyes scanning the perimeter as if expecting something to emerge from the shadows at any moment. Griffin had returned from his perimeter check a while ago, but he had stayed on the edge of the clearing, keeping to himself, his back turned toward Talon.

The silence between them was heavy, filled with unspoken tensions that lingered from their earlier arguments. Talon’s mind churned with thoughts of the medallion, its ever-present pulse still whispering in the back of his mind, though fainter now. He knew the others could sense something shifting in him, but they hadn’t spoken about it. Not yet.

“We need to make a decision soon,” Sari finally said, her voice low and measured. “We can’t keep running like this without a plan.”

Griffin didn’t turn around, his silhouette a dark shape against the edge of the fog. “You’ve been saying that for days, Sari. What do you suggest we do?”

Sari’s jaw tightened, her eyes flicking toward Talon. “I think we need to reach the Seer. He’s the only one who can help us understand the medallion... and what’s happening to Talon.”

Griffin turned then, his face hard, his eyes flashing with frustration. “The medallion is the problem. Not the solution.”

Talon felt a spark of anger flare up inside him, the same frustration that had been building since they left the clearing that morning. He opened his mouth to speak, to defend himself, but Sari held up a hand, cutting him off.

“Enough,” she said firmly. “Fighting isn’t going to get us anywhere. We have to stay focused. The Seer is the best option we have. If anyone knows what’s going on with the Veil, it’s him.”

Griffin shook his head, his gaze hardening. “And how do we know we can trust him? We barely know anything about this Seer. For all we know, he’s leading us into another trap.”

Talon clenched his fists, the medallion’s whispers growing louder again, feeding off his frustration. He could feel its power pulsing against his chest, urging him to speak, to push back against Griffin’s constant doubt. But Sari was right. Fighting wasn’t going to solve anything.

“We don’t have a better option,” Sari continued, her voice calm but firm. “Unless you have a better plan, Griffin?”

Griffin’s scowl deepened, but he didn’t respond. He turned away again, his hands resting on his sword as he stared into the fog beyond the firelight.

Talon’s mind churned, the weight of the medallion pressing down on him like a lead weight. He could feel the tension between him and Griffin growing, widening the gap that had once been filled by years of friendship. And it was all because of the medallion. Because of the Veil.

Suddenly, without thinking, Talon reached up and ripped the medallion from around his neck, the leather cord snapping under the force of his grip. The world around him seemed to still for a moment, the firelight flickering in his peripheral vision as he held the medallion in his fist.

“You want it, Griffin?” Talon snarled, his voice low but filled with barely restrained anger. “Take it. Let’s see if you can handle it.”

Without another word, he hurled the medallion at Griffin, the metal catching the firelight as it sailed through the air. Griffin turned just in time, catching the medallion in his hands, his eyes widening in surprise.

For a moment, the clearing was silent, the tension between them palpable. Sari stood frozen, her eyes darting between Talon and Griffin, unsure of what to say or do.

Griffin stared down at the medallion in his hands, his expression unreadable. The fire crackled softly, the only sound breaking the stillness.

Then, slowly, Griffin raised his eyes to meet Talon’s, his voice low and dangerous. “You think I want this? You think I want to be cursed like you?”

Talon’s jaw tightened, his fists clenching at his sides. “You don’t know anything about what this is. About what it’s doing to me.”

“Then tell us!” Griffin’s voice rose, frustration and anger boiling over. “Tell us what the hell is going on with you! All we’ve done is run. You’re keeping secrets, Talon, and it’s going to get us all killed.”

Sari stepped forward, her hand raised in a gesture of peace. “Both of you, stop. This isn’t helping. We need to stick together, now more than ever.”

But Talon couldn’t stop the torrent of words from spilling out. “You think I wanted this? You think I asked for this? The medallion... it’s not just some tool I can turn off and on. It’s in my head, Griffin. It’s inside me. And no matter how hard I try to control it, it’s always there, whispering, pulling me deeper.”

Griffin’s face hardened, his knuckles white as he gripped the medallion. “Then maybe you shouldn’t be the one carrying it.”

The words hit Talon like a punch to the gut, and for a moment, he couldn’t breathe. Griffin’s words echoed in his mind, a stark reminder of how far they had drifted from the trust they once shared.

Sari’s voice broke through the silence, calm but firm. “We need each other. All of us. This medallion... whatever it is, we need to figure it out together. But tearing each other apart isn’t the answer.”

Talon swallowed hard, his throat tight as he struggled to keep his emotions in check. He had thrown the medallion in a moment of anger, but now he wasn’t sure what was worse: the weight of carrying it, or the thought of someone else holding that burden.

Griffin stared at the medallion for a long moment before he finally tossed it back to Talon, his eyes hard. “Keep it. But don’t think for a second that I trust you with it.”

Talon caught the medallion, the cold metal heavy in his palm. The firelight flickered over the engraved glyphs, casting eerie shadows on his skin. The whispers in his mind had quieted, but they were still there, lurking just beneath the surface, waiting for their chance.

Sari let out a soft sigh, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly. “We’ll figure this out. Together.”

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure if he believed her. The weight of the medallion settled back around his neck as he slipped the cord over his head. The fire crackled softly, the fog swirling around them like a living thing, and Talon knew that whatever came next, the medallion’s hold on him was far from over.

And with every step deeper into the forest, the shadows seemed to grow longer, as if the Veil itself was watching, waiting for the moment when it would pull them all under.
