**Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

**The Group’s Distrust Grows**

The silence that followed was heavy, charged with unspoken tension. Talon could feel Griffin’s eyes on him, the weight of his disapproval palpable even in the darkened forest. Sari’s hand remained on his shoulder, grounding him, but her touch was tentative now, as if she wasn’t sure what had just happened either. The hum of the cuff had quieted, but its presence was still there, lingering in his bones, a reminder of the power that had just slipped through his fingers.

"Are you alright?" Sari asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon nodded, but the truth was he didn’t know. He wasn’t alright. The vision had left him shaken, his mind still reeling from the sight of the alien city, the **whispers** that had promised him the truth. He didn’t understand what was happening to him—didn’t understand the **Veil’s power** or why it had chosen him. All he knew was that every time he used the cuff, he felt like he was drifting further away from himself.

"I’m fine," he lied, pulling away from Sari’s grasp. His legs were still shaky, his breath uneven, but he couldn’t afford to show weakness—not now. Not when Griffin was watching him like that.

Griffin’s voice cut through the quiet, sharp and cold. "You don’t look fine." He took a step forward, his eyes narrowing as he studied Talon. "Whatever’s going on with that cuff of yours, you need to get it under control. You’re putting all of us at risk."

Talon’s chest tightened at the accusation. He wanted to argue, to defend himself, but the words caught in his throat. Griffin wasn’t wrong. Every time he used the cuff, something went wrong. He had tried to harness its power, to protect them, but it was slipping out of his grasp faster than he could manage. And the more he tried to control it, the more it felt like the Veil was controlling him instead.

Sari stepped in before Talon could respond, her voice steady but firm. "That’s not fair, Griffin. He’s trying. You know how dangerous this situation is. We all are."

Griffin’s jaw clenched, but he didn’t break eye contact with Talon. "Trying isn’t good enough. Not when we’re being hunted. We don’t have room for mistakes."

The words stung, even though Talon knew Griffin was speaking out of fear. The man had always been pragmatic, focused on survival, and Talon had no doubt that if it came down to it, Griffin would leave him behind to protect Sari and himself. He couldn’t blame him for that—it was survival instinct. But it didn’t make the weight of the cuff any easier to bear.

Talon forced himself to speak, his voice low and strained. "I’m doing the best I can. But I don’t even know what this is… what it wants."

Griffin scoffed, his frustration barely contained. "What it wants? You make it sound like the thing’s alive."

Talon swallowed, hesitating for a moment. "Maybe it is," he admitted quietly, unsure of what else to say. He couldn’t explain the visions, the **whispers from the Veil** that spoke to him like something sentient, something aware. Every time the cuff activated, it felt like it was guiding him—pulling him toward something, though he had no idea what.

Griffin shook his head, turning away. "I don’t have time for this. We need to keep moving before the Eidolons find us again."

Sari glanced between the two of them, her face tight with concern. "Griffin, just give him a moment. He’s been through a lot, and so have we."

But Griffin was already walking away, his pace brisk and unrelenting. "We don’t have time for moments, Sari. If we slow down, we’re dead."

Talon clenched his fists, watching as Griffin disappeared into the shadows of the forest ahead. The weight of the cuff on his wrist felt heavier than ever, a burden he wasn’t sure he could carry much longer. Sari was still beside him, her presence a quiet comfort, but Talon could sense her unease. She had always been the mediator between him and Griffin, but even she couldn’t bridge the growing chasm between them now.

"He’s just scared," Sari said after a moment, her voice soft. "We all are."

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure fear was all that was driving Griffin. The man had always been pragmatic, always focused on what was necessary to survive. And right now, Talon’s connection to the Veil was starting to feel like more of a liability than a strength.

"You don’t have to defend me," Talon said, his voice quieter than he intended. "Griffin’s right. I don’t know how to control this thing. And every time I try, something goes wrong."

Sari’s gaze softened, and she stepped closer, her hand resting on his arm. "You’re not alone in this, Talon. We’re all in this together. And whatever this cuff is, whatever the Veil wants… we’ll figure it out. But you can’t do it on your own."

Talon wanted to believe her. He wanted to believe that they could figure this out, that he wasn’t spiraling into something he couldn’t escape from. But the **whispers** from the Veil, the visions of the alien city—they were getting stronger, more insistent. And every time the cuff activated, Talon felt like he was losing another piece of himself to it.

"I don’t know how much longer I can handle this," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. "Every time I use the cuff… I feel like I’m slipping away. Like it’s pulling me into something I can’t control."

Sari’s eyes were filled with concern, but there was something else there too—**determination**. "Then we’ll figure it out together. Whatever this is, whatever the Veil wants from you, we’ll face it. But you can’t give up."

Talon looked at her, searching for some kind of reassurance, but all he could feel was the **looming presence** of the Veil in his mind, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him. He didn’t have the heart to tell her how close he was to giving up—how close he was to letting the Veil take over, just to end the struggle.

But instead, he nodded, his voice quiet. "Yeah. Together."

Sari offered him a small, reassuring smile before turning to follow Griffin. Talon took a deep breath, steadying himself as he moved to catch up. The hum of the cuff had quieted, but its presence was still there, just beneath the surface, waiting. He couldn’t afford to let it consume him. Not yet.

But deep down, he knew it was only a matter of time.
