**Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

**The Second Vision**

Night fell slowly, the oppressive darkness seeping in like a heavy fog, swallowing the forest around them. The air was thick and still, the distant sounds of nocturnal creatures muted as though even the wildlife knew to stay quiet in this part of the woods. Talon sat near the small fire they had managed to kindle, though the light did little to dispel the shadows clinging to the trees.

Sari sat across from him, her face bathed in the flickering orange glow. She was quiet, her gaze distant, lost in thought. Griffin was a few feet away, sharpening his knife with methodical precision, the sound of metal against stone the only noise breaking the silence. None of them spoke much after the argument earlier. The tension in the air was thick, but they all knew they had to keep moving forward, however difficult it was becoming.

Talon stared into the flames, his mind heavy with everything that had happened. The **cuff’s power**, the strange alien city in his vision, the whispers in his mind—they were all pieces of a puzzle he didn’t understand, and the more he tried to grasp them, the more they slipped through his fingers. His hands tightened into fists, the weight of the cuff on his wrist heavier than ever.

"You okay?" Sari’s voice pulled him from his thoughts, soft but filled with concern.

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure if it was the truth. "I’m fine," he muttered, his eyes still fixed on the fire.

Sari’s expression softened, but she didn’t push him further. She had always been the one to give him space when he needed it, unlike Griffin, who would force answers out of him whether he was ready or not. Talon appreciated Sari’s patience, but part of him knew she was just as worried as Griffin, maybe even more so.

As the fire crackled softly, Talon’s eyes grew heavy, exhaustion settling deep into his bones. He hadn’t slept well in days—not since the cuff had started pulling him deeper into the Veil. The visions, the whispers, the strange sensations coursing through his body—they were all becoming too much to handle. But sleep was dangerous. He knew that now. Every time he closed his eyes, the Veil came closer.

He tried to resist, but the weight of his exhaustion was overwhelming. His eyelids drooped, and before he could stop himself, the darkness swallowed him.

And then, once again, the world shifted.

Talon was no longer sitting by the fire. The forest was gone, replaced by the **ruins of the alien city**—the same towering structures he had seen before, crumbling into dust beneath the sickly green sky. The air was thick with ash, swirling around him in suffocating clouds, and the ground beneath his feet cracked and split with every step he took.

The **whispers** returned, louder this time, echoing in his mind like the voices of long-dead ghosts. Talon’s heart raced, his breath coming in shallow gasps. He knew this place wasn’t real, not in the way the forest had been, but the **Veil’s grip** on his mind made everything feel too tangible, too immediate.

Show us who you are.

Talon stumbled forward, his legs moving of their own accord. The symbols carved into the stone structures glowed faintly, their meanings lost to him, but the pull of them was undeniable. The closer he got, the more the whispers grew, coiling around his mind like vines. His pulse quickened, the cuff on his wrist thrumming in time with the alien symbols, the energy building inside him again.

He looked up at the sky, and there, hovering in the distance, was something new—**massive machines** hanging in the clouds, their sleek, angular forms ominous and terrifying. They weren’t like the Eidolons or the Revenant. These machines were vast, intelligent, part of something far greater than Talon could comprehend.

And then he saw them—the **gaunt alien figures**, the same beings he had glimpsed in his last vision. Their hollow eyes were fixed on him, their expressions unreadable, as they moved silently through the ruins. They were not human, but there was something in their posture, their movements, that suggested desperation. As if they, too, were running from something.

The whispers grew louder, insistent now, pressing against the edges of his mind.

We are the only way.

Talon stumbled, his head pounding, the light from the cuff flaring again. The machines in the sky loomed closer, their presence overwhelming, and the symbols on the ground pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat.

It was all too much. The city. The aliens. The machines. The whispers. It felt like his mind was being torn apart, pulled in too many directions at once, as though the Veil itself was trying to consume him.

Let go, Talon. We can show you everything.

"No," he whispered, his voice shaking. "I don’t want this."

But the Veil wasn’t listening. The pull grew stronger, more forceful. The whispers became shouts, demanding obedience, and the symbols blazed so brightly they seared into his vision.

Suddenly, Talon felt a **sharp jolt**, like something snapping inside him. His vision blurred, the city and the aliens fading into a swirling mess of light and sound. His knees buckled, and the ground beneath him gave way, sending him tumbling into an endless void.

Talon gasped awake, his body drenched in sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. The fire was still crackling softly in front of him, but everything else felt wrong. His hands shook as he wiped the sweat from his forehead, the lingering sense of the alien city still haunting him.

Sari was by his side in an instant, her eyes wide with worry. "Talon, what happened? You were talking in your sleep. It was… it was like you were somewhere else."

Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps, his mind still reeling from the vision. "I—" he hesitated, unsure of how to explain what he had seen. The city. The aliens. The machines. The **Veil’s demands**. It all felt so real, so overwhelming.

"I saw it again," he whispered finally, his voice hoarse. "That place. The city. The… the machines."

Griffin had stopped sharpening his knife and was watching Talon closely from across the fire. His expression was hard to read, but Talon could sense the **suspicion** there, just beneath the surface.

"You can’t keep doing this," Griffin said after a long pause, his tone cold but measured. "Whatever that cuff is showing you, whatever the Veil wants from you… it’s not helping us survive. You need to control it."

Talon swallowed hard, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him again. He wanted to tell Griffin he was trying, but the truth was, he didn’t know how much longer he could keep **fighting the Veil’s pull**.

"I don’t know how," Talon admitted quietly, his voice barely audible.

Griffin’s expression darkened, but he didn’t push further. Instead, he simply stood, sheathing his knife and turning away. "We move at first light. If the Eidolons don’t kill us, your visions will."

Talon stared at the fire, his chest tight with a mixture of frustration, fear, and exhaustion. He could feel Sari watching him, but he didn’t look up. The cuff was quiet again, the vision gone, but the **whispers** still echoed faintly in his mind.

Show us who you are.
