**Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

**The First Activation**

The silence that settled over the landscape was thick, unnatural, as if the forest itself had drawn a breath and refused to release it. Talon’s footsteps crunched against the dead leaves beneath him, but even the sound of their movement felt muted, swallowed by the oppressive stillness that hung in the air. The cuff on his wrist pulsed faintly, a subtle reminder of the power he didn’t fully understand—a power that had saved them from the Eidolons, but at a cost he hadn’t yet reckoned with.

Sari walked beside him, her expression unreadable, but Talon could sense her unease. She had always been the one to bridge the gap between him and Griffin, the steady presence that kept their fragile group from unraveling. Yet, even she was quieter now, her gaze occasionally drifting toward the cuff with something akin to concern.

Griffin, ahead of them, moved with his usual intensity, scanning their surroundings for any sign of danger. The man never seemed to stop moving, his body coiled tight like a spring, ready to snap at the first hint of a threat. Talon wondered if Griffin ever felt fear the way he did—an all-consuming, paralyzing fear that clawed at his mind, whispering doubts he couldn’t shake.

But Griffin was solid, always moving, always sure of what to do next. And Talon… Talon felt like he was barely holding on.

They had been walking for hours, deeper into unfamiliar territory, leaving the remnants of the ravine and the battle with the Eidolons behind them. The forest here was different, darker somehow, as though the trees themselves had grown twisted by time and the unnatural presence of Metis’s influence. Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that the further they went, the more distorted everything became—**like reality itself was shifting** beneath their feet.

The cuff throbbed again, a low hum that seemed to resonate not just in his wrist but in his chest, his skull. He clenched his fist, trying to will the sensation away, but it persisted. There was something about this place that made the cuff… louder.

"Do you hear that?" Sari’s voice broke the silence, barely above a whisper.

Talon looked at her, blinking away the fog that seemed to cloud his thoughts. "Hear what?"

She hesitated, glancing at Griffin before lowering her voice even more. "It’s like… a hum. Faint, but constant. Like we’re walking into something we shouldn’t be."

Talon swallowed hard, his eyes drifting down to the cuff. The hum was louder now, a soft vibration that pulsed in time with his heartbeat. He had heard it before, back when he had released that burst of energy to fend off the Eidolons. But this… this was different. It wasn’t just the cuff anymore—it was the **Veil** itself, calling to him.

"I feel it too," he admitted, his voice hoarse. He flexed his fingers, trying to shake the sensation. "It’s like… it’s pulling me."

Griffin stopped abruptly, turning to face them. His eyes narrowed, and Talon could see the flicker of suspicion that had been growing in Griffin ever since the fight. "What do you mean, pulling you?"

Talon opened his mouth to respond, but no words came. How could he explain something that he didn’t even understand himself? The way the cuff seemed to pulse with life, the way the whispers from the Veil grew louder the closer they got to… whatever was ahead of them. The way it felt like something deep within him was **awakening**, pushing against his control.

"Nothing," he muttered, looking away. "It’s nothing."

Griffin’s gaze lingered on him for a moment too long before he turned back and resumed walking. "We need to stay focused. We can’t afford distractions right now."

Sari shot Talon a glance, her eyes soft with concern, but she didn’t press the issue. Instead, they walked in silence, the tension between them as thick as the air around them. Talon felt the hum growing stronger, vibrating through his bones now, a dull, persistent ache that refused to be ignored.

And then, without warning, the cuff **flared to life**.

A jolt of energy shot through him, sudden and violent, as though he had been struck by lightning. Talon gasped, stumbling, his vision swimming with a blinding white light that erased everything around him. The forest, the trees, Sari and Griffin—it all vanished, replaced by a vast, empty void that stretched endlessly in all directions.

He was alone. The only sound was the **thrum of the cuff**, louder than ever, echoing in his skull like a heartbeat. And then the whisper came.

Come closer.

Talon’s breath hitched, his body frozen as the voice slithered through his mind, soft and insistent. It was the same voice he had heard before, the same one that had urged him to let go, to give in to the power of the Veil. But this time, it was stronger, more tangible, as though the Veil itself had reached out and **touched him**.

Come closer, Talon. We can show you the truth.

The light around him shifted, and suddenly, he wasn’t alone. The alien city he had glimpsed before materialized before him—**ruined, desolate**, with towering structures that jutted into the sky like jagged teeth. Shadows moved in the distance, long, gaunt figures that seemed to **flicker in and out of existence**, their forms barely discernible.

Talon tried to move, but his body wouldn’t respond. He was stuck, frozen in place, as the city stretched out before him, the **alien symbols** carved into the stone glowing faintly in the sickly green light. He didn’t understand what he was seeing, but deep down, he knew it was connected to the Veil—connected to the power that had taken hold of him.

Show us who you are.

The voice grew louder, more demanding. Talon’s head throbbed, the light growing brighter, more blinding. He tried to scream, but no sound came.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the vision shattered.

The forest snapped back into focus, the trees looming over him once more. Talon stumbled, gasping for air, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him like an anchor. Sari was by his side in an instant, her hand on his shoulder, her face pale with worry.

"Talon!" she breathed, her voice filled with fear. "What happened?"

He shook his head, trying to find the words, but his mind was still reeling from the vision. "I… I don’t know. I…"

Griffin turned, his eyes dark and unreadable. "What do you mean, you don’t know? You almost collapsed. You need to get a grip on whatever’s going on with you, or you’re going to get us killed."

Talon couldn’t respond. The hum of the cuff had faded, but the **echo of the vision** still clung to him, a lingering reminder of the power he couldn’t control. The alien city. The whispers. The promise of the truth.

He wasn’t sure if he could handle it.
