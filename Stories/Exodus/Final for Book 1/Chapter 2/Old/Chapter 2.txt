**Chapter 2: Signs of the Veil**

**The First Activation**

The silence that settled over the landscape was thick, unnatural, as if the forest itself had drawn a breath and refused to release it. Talon’s footsteps crunched against the dead leaves beneath him, but even the sound of their movement felt muted, swallowed by the oppressive stillness that hung in the air. The cuff on his wrist pulsed faintly, a subtle reminder of the power he didn’t fully understand—a power that had saved them from the Eidolons, but at a cost he hadn’t yet reckoned with.

Sari walked beside him, her expression unreadable, but Talon could sense her unease. She had always been the one to bridge the gap between him and Griffin, the steady presence that kept their fragile group from unraveling. Yet, even she was quieter now, her gaze occasionally drifting toward the cuff with something akin to concern.

Griffin, ahead of them, moved with his usual intensity, scanning their surroundings for any sign of danger. The man never seemed to stop moving, his body coiled tight like a spring, ready to snap at the first hint of a threat. Talon wondered if Griffin ever felt fear the way he did—an all-consuming, paralyzing fear that clawed at his mind, whispering doubts he couldn’t shake.

But Griffin was solid, always moving, always sure of what to do next. And Talon… Talon felt like he was barely holding on.

They had been walking for hours, deeper into unfamiliar territory, leaving the remnants of the ravine and the battle with the Eidolons behind them. The forest here was different, darker somehow, as though the trees themselves had grown twisted by time and the unnatural presence of Metis’s influence. Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that the further they went, the more distorted everything became—**like reality itself was shifting** beneath their feet.

The cuff throbbed again, a low hum that seemed to resonate not just in his wrist but in his chest, his skull. He clenched his fist, trying to will the sensation away, but it persisted. There was something about this place that made the cuff… louder.

"Do you hear that?" Sari’s voice broke the silence, barely above a whisper.

Talon looked at her, blinking away the fog that seemed to cloud his thoughts. "Hear what?"

She hesitated, glancing at Griffin before lowering her voice even more. "It’s like… a hum. Faint, but constant. Like we’re walking into something we shouldn’t be."

Talon swallowed hard, his eyes drifting down to the cuff. The hum was louder now, a soft vibration that pulsed in time with his heartbeat. He had heard it before, back when he had released that burst of energy to fend off the Eidolons. But this… this was different. It wasn’t just the cuff anymore—it was the **Veil** itself, calling to him.

"I feel it too," he admitted, his voice hoarse. He flexed his fingers, trying to shake the sensation. "It’s like… it’s pulling me."

Griffin stopped abruptly, turning to face them. His eyes narrowed, and Talon could see the flicker of suspicion that had been growing in Griffin ever since the fight. "What do you mean, pulling you?"

Talon opened his mouth to respond, but no words came. How could he explain something that he didn’t even understand himself? The way the cuff seemed to pulse with life, the way the whispers from the Veil grew louder the closer they got to… whatever was ahead of them. The way it felt like something deep within him was **awakening**, pushing against his control.

"Nothing," he muttered, looking away. "It’s nothing."

Griffin’s gaze lingered on him for a moment too long before he turned back and resumed walking. "We need to stay focused. We can’t afford distractions right now."

Sari shot Talon a glance, her eyes soft with concern, but she didn’t press the issue. Instead, they walked in silence, the tension between them as thick as the air around them. Talon felt the hum growing stronger, vibrating through his bones now, a dull, persistent ache that refused to be ignored.

And then, without warning, the cuff **flared to life**.

A jolt of energy shot through him, sudden and violent, as though he had been struck by lightning. Talon gasped, stumbling, his vision swimming with a blinding white light that erased everything around him. The forest, the trees, Sari and Griffin—it all vanished, replaced by a vast, empty void that stretched endlessly in all directions.

He was alone. The only sound was the **thrum of the cuff**, louder than ever, echoing in his skull like a heartbeat. And then the whisper came.

Come closer.

Talon’s breath hitched, his body frozen as the voice slithered through his mind, soft and insistent. It was the same voice he had heard before, the same one that had urged him to let go, to give in to the power of the Veil. But this time, it was stronger, more tangible, as though the Veil itself had reached out and **touched him**.

Come closer, Talon. We can show you the truth.

The light around him shifted, and suddenly, he wasn’t alone. The alien city he had glimpsed before materialized before him—**ruined, desolate**, with towering structures that jutted into the sky like jagged teeth. Shadows moved in the distance, long, gaunt figures that seemed to **flicker in and out of existence**, their forms barely discernible.

Talon tried to move, but his body wouldn’t respond. He was stuck, frozen in place, as the city stretched out before him, the **alien symbols** carved into the stone glowing faintly in the sickly green light. He didn’t understand what he was seeing, but deep down, he knew it was connected to the Veil—connected to the power that had taken hold of him.

Show us who you are.

The voice grew louder, more demanding. Talon’s head throbbed, the light growing brighter, more blinding. He tried to scream, but no sound came.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the vision shattered.

The forest snapped back into focus, the trees looming over him once more. Talon stumbled, gasping for air, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him like an anchor. Sari was by his side in an instant, her hand on his shoulder, her face pale with worry.

"Talon!" she breathed, her voice filled with fear. "What happened?"

He shook his head, trying to find the words, but his mind was still reeling from the vision. "I… I don’t know. I…"

Griffin turned, his eyes dark and unreadable. "What do you mean, you don’t know? You almost collapsed. You need to get a grip on whatever’s going on with you, or you’re going to get us killed."

Talon couldn’t respond. The hum of the cuff had faded, but the **echo of the vision** still clung to him, a lingering reminder of the power he couldn’t control. The alien city. The whispers. The promise of the truth.

He wasn’t sure if he could handle it.

**The Group’s Distrust Grows**

The silence that followed was heavy, charged with unspoken tension. Talon could feel Griffin’s eyes on him, the weight of his disapproval palpable even in the darkened forest. Sari’s hand remained on his shoulder, grounding him, but her touch was tentative now, as if she wasn’t sure what had just happened either. The hum of the cuff had quieted, but its presence was still there, lingering in his bones, a reminder of the power that had just slipped through his fingers.

"Are you alright?" Sari asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon nodded, but the truth was he didn’t know. He wasn’t alright. The vision had left him shaken, his mind still reeling from the sight of the alien city, the **whispers** that had promised him the truth. He didn’t understand what was happening to him—didn’t understand the **Veil’s power** or why it had chosen him. All he knew was that every time he used the cuff, he felt like he was drifting further away from himself.

"I’m fine," he lied, pulling away from Sari’s grasp. His legs were still shaky, his breath uneven, but he couldn’t afford to show weakness—not now. Not when Griffin was watching him like that.

Griffin’s voice cut through the quiet, sharp and cold. "You don’t look fine." He took a step forward, his eyes narrowing as he studied Talon. "Whatever’s going on with that cuff of yours, you need to get it under control. You’re putting all of us at risk."

Talon’s chest tightened at the accusation. He wanted to argue, to defend himself, but the words caught in his throat. Griffin wasn’t wrong. Every time he used the cuff, something went wrong. He had tried to harness its power, to protect them, but it was slipping out of his grasp faster than he could manage. And the more he tried to control it, the more it felt like the Veil was controlling him instead.

Sari stepped in before Talon could respond, her voice steady but firm. "That’s not fair, Griffin. He’s trying. You know how dangerous this situation is. We all are."

Griffin’s jaw clenched, but he didn’t break eye contact with Talon. "Trying isn’t good enough. Not when we’re being hunted. We don’t have room for mistakes."

The words stung, even though Talon knew Griffin was speaking out of fear. The man had always been pragmatic, focused on survival, and Talon had no doubt that if it came down to it, Griffin would leave him behind to protect Sari and himself. He couldn’t blame him for that—it was survival instinct. But it didn’t make the weight of the cuff any easier to bear.

Talon forced himself to speak, his voice low and strained. "I’m doing the best I can. But I don’t even know what this is… what it wants."

Griffin scoffed, his frustration barely contained. "What it wants? You make it sound like the thing’s alive."

Talon swallowed, hesitating for a moment. "Maybe it is," he admitted quietly, unsure of what else to say. He couldn’t explain the visions, the **whispers from the Veil** that spoke to him like something sentient, something aware. Every time the cuff activated, it felt like it was guiding him—pulling him toward something, though he had no idea what.

Griffin shook his head, turning away. "I don’t have time for this. We need to keep moving before the Eidolons find us again."

Sari glanced between the two of them, her face tight with concern. "Griffin, just give him a moment. He’s been through a lot, and so have we."

But Griffin was already walking away, his pace brisk and unrelenting. "We don’t have time for moments, Sari. If we slow down, we’re dead."

Talon clenched his fists, watching as Griffin disappeared into the shadows of the forest ahead. The weight of the cuff on his wrist felt heavier than ever, a burden he wasn’t sure he could carry much longer. Sari was still beside him, her presence a quiet comfort, but Talon could sense her unease. She had always been the mediator between him and Griffin, but even she couldn’t bridge the growing chasm between them now.

"He’s just scared," Sari said after a moment, her voice soft. "We all are."

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure fear was all that was driving Griffin. The man had always been pragmatic, always focused on what was necessary to survive. And right now, Talon’s connection to the Veil was starting to feel like more of a liability than a strength.

"You don’t have to defend me," Talon said, his voice quieter than he intended. "Griffin’s right. I don’t know how to control this thing. And every time I try, something goes wrong."

Sari’s gaze softened, and she stepped closer, her hand resting on his arm. "You’re not alone in this, Talon. We’re all in this together. And whatever this cuff is, whatever the Veil wants… we’ll figure it out. But you can’t do it on your own."

Talon wanted to believe her. He wanted to believe that they could figure this out, that he wasn’t spiraling into something he couldn’t escape from. But the **whispers** from the Veil, the visions of the alien city—they were getting stronger, more insistent. And every time the cuff activated, Talon felt like he was losing another piece of himself to it.

"I don’t know how much longer I can handle this," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. "Every time I use the cuff… I feel like I’m slipping away. Like it’s pulling me into something I can’t control."

Sari’s eyes were filled with concern, but there was something else there too—**determination**. "Then we’ll figure it out together. Whatever this is, whatever the Veil wants from you, we’ll face it. But you can’t give up."

Talon looked at her, searching for some kind of reassurance, but all he could feel was the **looming presence** of the Veil in his mind, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him. He didn’t have the heart to tell her how close he was to giving up—how close he was to letting the Veil take over, just to end the struggle.

But instead, he nodded, his voice quiet. "Yeah. Together."

Sari offered him a small, reassuring smile before turning to follow Griffin. Talon took a deep breath, steadying himself as he moved to catch up. The hum of the cuff had quieted, but its presence was still there, just beneath the surface, waiting. He couldn’t afford to let it consume him. Not yet.

But deep down, he knew it was only a matter of time.

**The Second Vision**

Night fell slowly, the oppressive darkness seeping in like a heavy fog, swallowing the forest around them. The air was thick and still, the distant sounds of nocturnal creatures muted as though even the wildlife knew to stay quiet in this part of the woods. Talon sat near the small fire they had managed to kindle, though the light did little to dispel the shadows clinging to the trees.

Sari sat across from him, her face bathed in the flickering orange glow. She was quiet, her gaze distant, lost in thought. Griffin was a few feet away, sharpening his knife with methodical precision, the sound of metal against stone the only noise breaking the silence. None of them spoke much after the argument earlier. The tension in the air was thick, but they all knew they had to keep moving forward, however difficult it was becoming.

Talon stared into the flames, his mind heavy with everything that had happened. The **cuff’s power**, the strange alien city in his vision, the whispers in his mind—they were all pieces of a puzzle he didn’t understand, and the more he tried to grasp them, the more they slipped through his fingers. His hands tightened into fists, the weight of the cuff on his wrist heavier than ever.

"You okay?" Sari’s voice pulled him from his thoughts, soft but filled with concern.

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure if it was the truth. "I’m fine," he muttered, his eyes still fixed on the fire.

Sari’s expression softened, but she didn’t push him further. She had always been the one to give him space when he needed it, unlike Griffin, who would force answers out of him whether he was ready or not. Talon appreciated Sari’s patience, but part of him knew she was just as worried as Griffin, maybe even more so.

As the fire crackled softly, Talon’s eyes grew heavy, exhaustion settling deep into his bones. He hadn’t slept well in days—not since the cuff had started pulling him deeper into the Veil. The visions, the whispers, the strange sensations coursing through his body—they were all becoming too much to handle. But sleep was dangerous. He knew that now. Every time he closed his eyes, the Veil came closer.

He tried to resist, but the weight of his exhaustion was overwhelming. His eyelids drooped, and before he could stop himself, the darkness swallowed him.

And then, once again, the world shifted.

Talon was no longer sitting by the fire. The forest was gone, replaced by the **ruins of the alien city**—the same towering structures he had seen before, crumbling into dust beneath the sickly green sky. The air was thick with ash, swirling around him in suffocating clouds, and the ground beneath his feet cracked and split with every step he took.

The **whispers** returned, louder this time, echoing in his mind like the voices of long-dead ghosts. Talon’s heart raced, his breath coming in shallow gasps. He knew this place wasn’t real, not in the way the forest had been, but the **Veil’s grip** on his mind made everything feel too tangible, too immediate.

Show us who you are.

Talon stumbled forward, his legs moving of their own accord. The symbols carved into the stone structures glowed faintly, their meanings lost to him, but the pull of them was undeniable. The closer he got, the more the whispers grew, coiling around his mind like vines. His pulse quickened, the cuff on his wrist thrumming in time with the alien symbols, the energy building inside him again.

He looked up at the sky, and there, hovering in the distance, was something new—**massive machines** hanging in the clouds, their sleek, angular forms ominous and terrifying. They weren’t like the Eidolons or the Revenant. These machines were vast, intelligent, part of something far greater than Talon could comprehend.

And then he saw them—the **gaunt alien figures**, the same beings he had glimpsed in his last vision. Their hollow eyes were fixed on him, their expressions unreadable, as they moved silently through the ruins. They were not human, but there was something in their posture, their movements, that suggested desperation. As if they, too, were running from something.

The whispers grew louder, insistent now, pressing against the edges of his mind.

We are the only way.

Talon stumbled, his head pounding, the light from the cuff flaring again. The machines in the sky loomed closer, their presence overwhelming, and the symbols on the ground pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat.

It was all too much. The city. The aliens. The machines. The whispers. It felt like his mind was being torn apart, pulled in too many directions at once, as though the Veil itself was trying to consume him.

Let go, Talon. We can show you everything.

"No," he whispered, his voice shaking. "I don’t want this."

But the Veil wasn’t listening. The pull grew stronger, more forceful. The whispers became shouts, demanding obedience, and the symbols blazed so brightly they seared into his vision.

Suddenly, Talon felt a **sharp jolt**, like something snapping inside him. His vision blurred, the city and the aliens fading into a swirling mess of light and sound. His knees buckled, and the ground beneath him gave way, sending him tumbling into an endless void.

---

Talon gasped awake, his body drenched in sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. The fire was still crackling softly in front of him, but everything else felt wrong. His hands shook as he wiped the sweat from his forehead, the lingering sense of the alien city still haunting him.

Sari was by his side in an instant, her eyes wide with worry. "Talon, what happened? You were talking in your sleep. It was… it was like you were somewhere else."

Talon’s breath came in ragged gasps, his mind still reeling from the vision. "I—" he hesitated, unsure of how to explain what he had seen. The city. The aliens. The machines. The **Veil’s demands**. It all felt so real, so overwhelming.

"I saw it again," he whispered finally, his voice hoarse. "That place. The city. The… the machines."

Griffin had stopped sharpening his knife and was watching Talon closely from across the fire. His expression was hard to read, but Talon could sense the **suspicion** there, just beneath the surface.

"You can’t keep doing this," Griffin said after a long pause, his tone cold but measured. "Whatever that cuff is showing you, whatever the Veil wants from you… it’s not helping us survive. You need to control it."

Talon swallowed hard, the weight of the cuff pressing down on him again. He wanted to tell Griffin he was trying, but the truth was, he didn’t know how much longer he could keep **fighting the Veil’s pull**.

"I don’t know how," Talon admitted quietly, his voice barely audible.

Griffin’s expression darkened, but he didn’t push further. Instead, he simply stood, sheathing his knife and turning away. "We move at first light. If the Eidolons don’t kill us, your visions will."

Talon stared at the fire, his chest tight with a mixture of frustration, fear, and exhaustion. He could feel Sari watching him, but he didn’t look up. The cuff was quiet again, the vision gone, but the **whispers** still echoed faintly in his mind.

Show us who you are.
