### **Workflow for Refinement:**
1. Apply **Conflict and Stakes** prompt and loop until desired score.
2. Move to **Tension and Suspense**, loop until it meets your score target.
3. Continue through each category, looping and refining until all categories hit the desired score.

### **Automation**:
- Each prompt will need a score input to automate looping (e.g., once the score reaches 4 or 5, it stops). After all loops, the chapter will be fully refined.
