**Chapter 1: On the Run**

#### **Talon’s Hallucinations**

Time seemed to freeze as the Eidolons lunged. Talon’s heart raced, the hum of the cuff growing louder, an insistent pulse in his veins. The creatures moved as one, their limbs cutting through the air like blades. Talon raised his arm instinctively, but something inside him hesitated—**the pull of the Veil**, the whisper that had been lurking at the edges of his mind all this time, grew louder, drowning out everything else.

Just let go.

He could feel the **Veil’s power** building inside him, pressing against his consciousness, urging him to release it. His vision blurred, the forest around him flickering, twisting, until he was no longer standing in the woods at all. The trees dissolved, replaced by towering, alien structures—dark and jagged, their surfaces crawling with strange, glowing symbols that pulsed in time with the cuff’s hum. The air was thick with ash, the sky a sickly green hue. He was standing in the ruins of a world he didn’t recognize but somehow felt deeply connected to.

Talon stumbled backward, his breath coming in short, panicked bursts. The ground beneath his feet shifted, unstable, like he was walking on the edge of a precipice, teetering on the brink of a fall. His head pounded, the whispers growing louder, more insistent.

We can show you the truth.

The world around him twisted again. This time, he saw them—the alien beings. Tall, gaunt figures, their bodies cloaked in shadows, moving silently through the ruins. They were like ghosts, flickering in and out of his vision, their forms barely discernible. They reached out toward him, their hands outstretched, and Talon felt an overwhelming sense of dread. He couldn’t tell if they were trying to warn him or pull him deeper into their world.

"Talon!" The voice cut through the hallucination like a knife, sharp and urgent.

Suddenly, the vision shattered, the alien world collapsing around him, dissolving into nothingness. Talon blinked hard, his chest heaving as the forest came back into focus. The Eidolons were still there, frozen mid-lunge, their angular forms distorted in his blurred vision. Sari’s hand was gripping his arm tightly, pulling him back to reality.

"Talon!" she repeated, her voice fierce, her eyes wide with fear. "We need you here. Now."

The cuff’s glow faded, the power receding as quickly as it had built. Talon felt a wave of nausea wash over him, his legs trembling. The voices were gone, but the echo of the vision lingered, haunting the edges of his mind.

The Eidolons, sensing the momentary weakness, struck again. But this time, Talon was ready.

Griffin had scrambled to his feet, his knife flashing as he fended off one of the creatures. Sari stood beside him, her body tense, every movement calculated. The Eidolon nearest to her lunged again, but she ducked beneath its blade-like arm and struck out with her foot, sending it stumbling.

Talon steadied himself, feeling the faint thrum of the cuff still pulsing against his skin. He wasn’t sure how much more power he could pull from it without losing himself completely. The Veil was too close, too dangerous. But he had no choice.

He raised his arm, the cuff humming louder again, and this time, he let a small fraction of the power slip free. A ripple of energy surged through the air, just enough to knock the nearest Eidolon off its trajectory. It hit the ground hard, metal scraping against stone as it struggled to right itself.

"Talon!" Griffin shouted, his voice laced with frustration as he parried another attack. "Now would be a good time!"

Talon’s vision wavered, the forest blurring again, but he forced himself to focus. The cuff felt heavier, as if the Veil itself was pressing down on him, pulling him toward it. He clenched his teeth, refusing to give in to the whispers, and released another burst of energy.

The air around him seemed to crackle, the light from the cuff flaring brightly as the second Eidolon was thrown backward. It crashed into a tree with a deafening screech, sparks flying from its fractured body.

Griffin took advantage of the momentary lull, darting forward to drive his knife into the last standing Eidolon’s neck joint. The creature convulsed, its limbs jerking wildly before it crumpled to the ground, lifeless.

For a moment, everything was still. The only sound was their heavy breathing, the quiet rustling of leaves in the wind, and the distant hum of something far more sinister in the distance.

Talon collapsed to his knees, his body trembling from the strain. His head throbbed, the remnants of the vision still clinging to the edges of his mind. The alien city. The gaunt figures. The strange symbols glowing in the dark. What was the Veil trying to show him?

Sari knelt beside him, her hand on his shoulder, her touch grounding him in reality. "Talon," she said softly, her voice filled with concern, "are you okay?"

He opened his mouth to respond, but the words wouldn’t come. His mind was still reeling from the vision, from the weight of the cuff and the power it held. How much longer could he keep this up? How much longer before the Veil consumed him completely?

"I don’t know," he whispered, his voice barely audible. "I don’t know what’s real anymore."

Griffin stood nearby, his eyes narrowed, scanning the treeline for any sign of more Eidolons. "We need to move," he said, his voice cold, pragmatic. "They’ll be back. They always come back."

Talon nodded weakly, forcing himself to stand. His legs felt like they would give out at any moment, but he pushed the feeling aside. He couldn’t afford to be weak. Not now. Not when the Veil was closing in on him, and the Eidolons were still hunting them.

"Let’s go," he said, his voice steadier than he felt.

As they moved deeper into the forest, the whispering began again, faint and distant, but impossible to ignore.

Let go, Talon. Let us show you the truth.
