**Chapter 1: On the Run**

**The Ambush**

The forest pressed in around them, shadows stretching unnaturally beneath the dense canopy. The air was thick with tension, the silence of the wilderness broken only by the faint sound of their ragged breathing and the occasional crunch of leaves beneath their boots. Talon stumbled forward, his legs burning, every breath a struggle. The cuff on his wrist felt heavier than ever, like a shackle pulling him down, threatening to drag him to the forest floor.

"Keep moving!" Griffin's voice cut through the haze of exhaustion, sharp and urgent. He was always in front, always pushing them forward, his broad frame cutting a path through the undergrowth. "They’re closing in!"

Behind them, the Eidolons were nothing more than shadows in the mist, but Talon could feel their presence—a low, unnatural hum that vibrated in his skull, sending shivers down his spine. He glanced back, the hairs on his neck standing on end. The shapes that moved through the trees were barely visible, more suggestion than substance, but they were fast, and they were relentless.

Sari ran beside him, her breath coming in short, controlled gasps. Her eyes darted around the forest, alert and calculating, but even she couldn’t hide the fear that flickered in her gaze. She’d seen the Eidolons before, but this time, they were different. Stronger. Smarter.

"Talon!" Sari’s voice was a lifeline, pulling him out of his daze. "Focus. Don’t let the cuff take over. We need you here."

Talon nodded, though his mind felt distant, like he was slipping into a dream. The cuff pulsed on his wrist, a faint, rhythmic throb that seemed to match the beat of his heart. His vision wavered for a moment, the edges of reality blurring as a whisper, soft and indistinct, brushed against his thoughts.

Run.

Talon blinked, shaking his head as if to clear the fog settling over him. He couldn’t afford to lose focus, not now, not with the Eidolons so close. But the whisper lingered, a faint voice from somewhere far away, urging him to give in, to let go.

Up ahead, Griffin skidded to a stop, raising his hand to signal the others. Talon nearly collided with him, his body moving on autopilot, driven by pure adrenaline. Griffin turned, his face etched with frustration and fear. "We need to find higher ground. The Eidolons—they’re herding us. They want us cornered."

Talon barely registered his words. The shadows in the forest were shifting again, darker now, more solid. He could see them moving—tall, lanky figures with limbs too long, too sharp. They glided through the trees like predators, their bodies silent, their eyes glowing faintly in the dim light.

"They’re here," Sari whispered, her voice tight with dread.

Griffin’s hand tightened around the hilt of his knife. "Get ready."

The attack came swift and without warning. The first Eidolon broke from the treeline with a speed that defied reason, its long, angular body cutting through the air like a knife. Griffin lunged forward, slashing with his blade, but the creature dodged effortlessly, moving with inhuman precision.

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest. He stumbled back, instinctively raising his arm, the cuff humming in response. For a moment, time seemed to slow, the world around him bending and twisting. He could feel the energy coursing through the cuff, a low, dangerous thrum that sent a jolt of power through his veins.

The Eidolon lunged for him, its razor-sharp limbs aimed straight for his throat. Talon’s vision blurred, the whispering voice in his head growing louder.

Let go.

Without thinking, Talon released the energy. A burst of light erupted from the cuff, blinding and violent, sending the Eidolon crashing into the trees with a guttural screech. Talon staggered, the force of the blast knocking him off balance, his vision swimming as the world tilted beneath him.

"Get up!" Griffin’s voice was harsh, but there was an edge of panic to it. "We have to move, now!"

Talon blinked, the shadows around him twisting and warping, shapes that didn’t belong flickering at the edges of his sight. He struggled to his feet, his legs trembling. The pulse from the cuff was fading, but the whispering remained, a ghostly echo in the back of his mind.

Sari grabbed his arm, pulling him forward. "Don’t stop. They’ll be back."

Talon nodded, though his thoughts were elsewhere. The voice, the power—it felt like something was pulling him deeper into the Veil, drawing him away from the world around him. The forest, the Eidolons, even Griffin and Sari felt distant, like they were slipping further away with every step.

He didn’t know how much longer he could keep running.
