Chapter 1: On the Run

The forest had become a maze of twisted trees and choking fog. Each step was harder than the last, the earth beneath their feet shifting unnaturally, as though the land itself resisted their escape. The air was heavy, thick with the remnants of the battle they had barely survived. Talon’s lungs burned as he ran, his heart pounding in his ears. The medallion against his chest pulsed in time with his racing heartbeat, as though it was alive, feeding off his fear.

“We can’t outrun them forever,” Griffin hissed, his voice barely carrying through the dense fog. His sword was still drawn, streaked with the dark residue of the Eidolons they had fought earlier. The blade gleamed faintly in the dim light, a solitary reminder of the struggle they had endured. He glanced over his shoulder at Talon, suspicion etched deep in his eyes, as though he expected Talon to betray them at any moment.

“I know,” Talon muttered under his breath, his hand brushing against the medallion. The cold metal sent a shiver through him. He could feel its power thrumming beneath his fingertips, calling to him, urging him to tap into it again. The urge gnawed at him, relentless, like an itch he couldn’t scratch. He resisted the pull, but the temptation lingered like a weight on his soul. The power was there—just a thought away. He could stop this. He could end the pursuit with a single surge of energy.

But he had seen the way Griffin looked at him. The distrust. The fear. It was enough to make him hesitate.

Ahead of them, Sari moved with an almost ethereal grace, her steps light and deliberate as she weaved through the undergrowth. Even in the near-total darkness, she seemed to find the safest path, her instincts sharper than any of theirs. Her breathing was steady, controlled, though Talon could sense the tension radiating from her. Every now and then, she would glance back, checking to make sure they were still with her, but her focus remained on finding an escape route. Talon followed her, though his mind was elsewhere—torn between the present danger and the medallion’s ever-growing pull.

The shadows of the trees seemed to stretch unnaturally, bending and warping at the edges of his vision. The fog clung to their clothes, wrapping them in its cold embrace, and every flicker of movement made Talon’s skin crawl. He could feel the medallion burning against his chest, as if the power inside it was growing stronger with each passing second, feeding on his fear and uncertainty. The further they ran, the more convinced Talon became that they were being hunted—by something far worse than the Eidolons. The air itself felt heavy, as if it were pressing down on them, suffocating them.

“We need a plan,” Sari said breathlessly as they reached a small clearing, her voice strained but steady. She stopped just long enough for Griffin and Talon to catch up, her eyes darting around the treeline for any sign of movement. The fog made it nearly impossible to see beyond a few feet, but Talon could feel the presence of something out there—something closing in on them.

“They’re closing in,” she added, barely above a whisper.

Talon’s hand hovered near the medallion. He could feel its power pulsing beneath his fingertips, a familiar, rhythmic beat that matched his own racing heart. Every second felt like an eternity, and the thought of unleashing the medallion’s power was almost comforting. It would be so easy—just a thought, just a flicker of energy, and he could end this.

“We can’t fight them off,” Griffin said, his voice low but tense, as if he were barely holding his emotions in check. His eyes flicked to Talon, sharp and accusing. “Not without losing someone.”

Talon knew what Griffin meant. The weight of his gaze was heavy, a silent accusation that lingered in the space between them. He could feel it in the way Griffin’s fingers twitched on the hilt of his sword, like he was preparing for something far worse than Eidolons. It wasn’t just about survival anymore. Griffin was afraid—afraid of him.

Talon closed his eyes for a brief moment, his thoughts racing. He could save them. He could use the medallion’s power—control it, this time. He had felt it back in the forest, the way it surged through him, giving him the strength to fend off the shadows. It hadn’t consumed him. Not fully. Maybe he could control it now. Maybe this time would be different. 

But that nagging voice in the back of his mind whispered otherwise. The memory of the **burning glyphs** etched into his skin made him hesitate. What if Griffin was right? What if the medallion was too dangerous? What if it wasn’t just power—it was a curse?

“Griffin’s right,” Sari said, breaking through his thoughts. Her voice was strained, the fear barely contained despite her best efforts. “We can’t fight them off. Not like this.”

Talon’s eyes snapped open. He had made up his mind. This wasn’t about fear or hesitation anymore. It was about survival. He could feel the pressure mounting around them, the darkness creeping closer with every breath. They didn’t have time to argue. They didn’t have time for doubt.

He reached for the medallion, his fingers brushing against the cold metal. The glyphs on his skin began to glow faintly, the light barely visible through the thick fog. But Talon felt the surge of power instantly, coursing through him like a bolt of lightning. It was intoxicating, overwhelming. For a moment, he felt unstoppable. He told himself it was for the group. He told himself he was in control.

He had to be.

The forest around them seemed to still, as if the world itself were holding its breath, waiting for what would come next. Talon clenched his jaw, his heart racing as he prepared to unleash the medallion’s power. The darkness was closing in, and with it, the unmistakable presence of the Eidolons—twisting shadows, stalking them through the mist.

But this time, Talon wouldn’t run. He wouldn’t hesitate.

The medallion pulsed one last time.

And Talon let go.

The moment Talon released the medallion’s power, the forest seemed to shift. The air around them vibrated, humming with the dark energy he had unleashed. The oppressive fog that had clung to the trees was suddenly pulled inward, spiraling around them like a vortex. The shadows lengthened, twisting unnaturally, as if the very fabric of the world had been disturbed by the medallion’s touch.

Sari gasped, stepping back instinctively. She glanced at Talon, her eyes wide with alarm. “Talon, what are you—”

Before she could finish, the darkness exploded.

The Eidolons, once distant, lunged forward from the shadows with renewed ferocity. Their forms were more defined now—no longer just shapeless masses of black smoke, but creatures with jagged edges and gleaming, razor-sharp claws. They moved faster, more deliberately, as if Talon’s use of the medallion had made them stronger.

Griffin was the first to react. He let out a sharp cry, swinging his sword with practiced precision. His blade met the closest Eidolon with a sickening hiss as it cut through the creature’s ethereal form, but the impact barely slowed it down. The Eidolon’s claws raked across Griffin’s arm, tearing through fabric and skin. Griffin cursed, staggering back as blood splattered onto the ground.

“Damn it, Talon!” he shouted, his voice filled with both pain and fury. “What did you do?!”

Talon’s breath came in ragged bursts as he tried to focus on the medallion. His heart raced, the power coursing through him with an intensity that made it hard to think clearly. He could feel the medallion’s grip tightening, as if it had become a part of him. The world around him blurred, his vision flickering between reality and something else—something alien, twisted, and ancient. He could see the outline of the Eidolons more clearly now, their bodies marked with the same glyphs that burned on his skin.

The power was intoxicating, but it was slipping out of his control.

Sari was fighting off two Eidolons at once, her daggers flashing in the faint light as she weaved between them with graceful precision. But Talon could see the strain in her movements. The creatures were relentless, their attacks faster and more coordinated than before. She was skilled, but she couldn’t hold them off forever.

“Talon!” Griffin’s voice rang out again, pulling him back to the present. He was fending off another creature, but his movements were slower, more desperate. Blood dripped from his wounded arm, and his breath was ragged.

Talon’s mind raced. He had to do something. He had to stop this.

He reached for the medallion again, but the moment his fingers brushed against it, a wave of pain shot through him. The glyphs on his skin flared to life, burning hotter than before. His vision blurred, the world around him spinning. He stumbled, his knees buckling beneath him as the power surged out of control.

The forest seemed to bend and warp, the trees twisting like living things. The ground beneath him shifted, trembling as though the earth itself was reacting to the medallion’s power. Talon’s head pounded, the whispers growing louder, more insistent, as if they were trying to tell him something—but he couldn’t understand.

He fell to his knees, gasping for breath as the weight of the medallion pressed down on him. The pain was unbearable, but he couldn’t let go. Not now. Not when everything depended on him.

“Talon, stop!” Sari’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and commanding. She fought her way toward him, her movements quick and fluid, despite the creatures still circling them. “You’re losing control!”

He could barely hear her. The medallion’s pull was too strong, the power too overwhelming. He was slipping—falling deeper into the Veil’s grasp. The line between reality and whatever the medallion showed him blurred until he could no longer tell which was which.

But even through the haze, he could hear Sari’s voice, firm and insistent. “Talon! You have to stop!”

With a supreme effort, Talon wrenched his hand away from the medallion. The moment he let go, the power ebbed, retreating back into the cold metal like a receding wave. His body trembled, the glyphs on his skin dimming to a faint glow. The world around him slowly stabilized, the trees returning to their twisted but familiar shapes. The ground beneath him stilled, though it still felt unsteady.

The Eidolons hesitated, their movements faltering as if the sudden loss of energy had disoriented them. Griffin didn’t waste a second. He lunged forward, his sword slashing through the nearest creature with renewed force, cutting it down before it could recover. Sari followed suit, her daggers moving in a blur as she took down the remaining two.

Talon collapsed onto his hands, his breath coming in shallow gasps. His body ached, and the medallion’s weight felt heavier than ever, pressing against his chest like a curse. He could feel the burn of the glyphs still etched into his skin, a constant reminder of the power he had tapped into—and the danger it posed.

Griffin approached him, his face a mask of barely restrained fury. Blood dripped from the wound on his arm, but he didn’t seem to care. His gaze was locked on Talon, eyes filled with accusation.

“What the hell were you thinking?” Griffin’s voice was low, but the anger in it was unmistakable. “You almost killed us.”

Talon tried to speak, but his throat felt dry, his voice barely a whisper. “I thought…I could control it.”

“Control it?” Griffin scoffed, stepping closer, his fists clenched. “You’re going to get us all killed.”

Sari stood nearby, her expression torn between worry and frustration. “Griffin, stop,” she said softly, though her voice was strained. “Talon’s trying. We all are.”

Griffin shook his head, his jaw clenched. “He’s not just trying—he’s risking all of our lives every time he touches that thing.” He pointed at the medallion, his eyes narrowing. “You need to make a choice, Talon. Either you control it, or it controls you.”

Talon lowered his head, his body shaking from the effort of keeping the medallion’s power at bay. He knew Griffin was right, but the words still stung. The truth was, he didn’t know if he could control it. Not anymore.

And as the last of the Eidolons dissolved into the shadows, Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that this was just the beginning.

Talon sat in silence, the weight of the medallion pulling at him, heavier than ever. The forest around them was unnervingly still, but Talon could feel the tension simmering beneath the surface. They weren’t safe here—not from the creatures lurking in the shadows, and certainly not from the power he carried within him. His body still trembled from the aftershocks of using the medallion, the pain from the burning glyphs etched into his skin dull but constant, like a wound that refused to heal.

The sky above had darkened into a deep, oppressive gray, and the trees, once gnarled and bent, now loomed like twisted sentinels, watching, waiting for something. The world felt foreign, as though it had shifted just slightly out of place, and Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that the medallion had pulled them closer to the Veil’s influence with every use.

Griffin paced a few feet away, his sword still in hand, though he hadn’t said anything since the battle. His expression was a storm of anger and frustration, but more than that—there was fear. It was in the way his eyes flicked toward Talon when he thought no one was looking, as if Talon were a ticking bomb, ready to explode at any moment.

Sari knelt nearby, tending to the shallow cut on Griffin’s arm. The wound was superficial, but her hands moved with careful precision, her focus shifting between her task and Talon. She hadn’t spoken much either, but her silence was different from Griffin’s. It was the silence of someone who was trying to piece together a puzzle, to understand the growing rift that was forming between them.

“We need to keep moving,” Griffin finally said, his voice cutting through the silence. “Staying here isn’t safe.”

Talon looked up, meeting his gaze. “We’re not in any shape to keep running. You’re hurt. Sari’s exhausted. I can feel it—something’s still out there.”

Griffin’s jaw clenched. “Something’s always out there, Talon. But we can’t stay in one place too long. You know that.”

Talon opened his mouth to argue, but Sari spoke first. “He’s right, Talon,” she said, her voice soft but firm. “We can’t risk another attack. Not so soon after the last one. We need to find shelter.”

Shelter. The word felt like a distant memory. It had been so long since Talon had felt safe anywhere—ever since he’d found the medallion, safety had become something unattainable, a fleeting hope that dissolved every time he thought he could grasp it. And now, with the Veil creeping closer, it felt even further away.

But Sari was right. They couldn’t stay here.

Talon rose to his feet, feeling the dull ache in his muscles. His hand instinctively moved to the medallion, but he stopped himself before touching it. The temptation to use it was always there, but he had seen the damage it could cause. He didn’t know if he could control it, but the others couldn’t know that. Not now.

“We’ll move,” Talon agreed, his voice quiet. “But we need to be smart about it.”

Griffin snorted, his eyes narrowing. “Smart? You mean not using that thing around your neck again?”

Talon bristled, but he bit back his retort. “I’m not going to use it unless I have to.”

“You said that before,” Griffin shot back, taking a step closer. His voice was low, but the tension in it was unmistakable. “And then you almost got us killed.”

Talon met his gaze, the familiar burn of guilt rising in his chest. Griffin was right—he had almost lost control. But what choice did he have? The Eidolons were relentless, the Veil’s influence growing stronger. Without the medallion, they wouldn’t have survived.

“I don’t like it either,” Talon admitted, his voice softer now. “But if it comes down to it… I’ll do what I have to.”

Griffin’s eyes flashed with anger. “And what happens when you can’t control it? What happens when it takes over? You think we’re just going to stand by and watch?”

Sari stood up, stepping between them before the argument could escalate further. “Enough,” she said, her voice firm. “This isn’t helping anyone. We can’t afford to fight each other right now.”

Griffin glared at Talon for a moment longer, then turned away with a sharp shake of his head. “We’ll find shelter. But I’m keeping watch.”

Sari let out a slow breath, her shoulders relaxing slightly as the tension eased. She glanced at Talon, her expression softening. “We’ll get through this,” she said quietly, though there was an uncertainty in her voice that betrayed her words.

Talon wanted to believe her, but the weight of the medallion against his chest was a constant reminder of the truth. The power he carried wasn’t just dangerous—it was consuming him. And no matter how much he tried to convince himself otherwise, he wasn’t sure if he could stop it.

The fog around them seemed to shift as they moved deeper into the forest, the trees growing taller and more twisted, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands. The world felt darker now, the oppressive atmosphere closing in around them like a shroud. Every step felt heavier than the last, the air thick with an unseen force that pressed down on them, making it harder to breathe.

Talon kept his hand close to the medallion, though he didn’t touch it. He could feel the Veil’s presence more acutely now, like a whisper at the edge of his mind, calling to him, tempting him with promises of power and control. It was seductive, the way it promised to protect them, to give him the strength he needed to survive.

But Talon knew the truth. The medallion wasn’t offering salvation. It was offering chains.

As they pushed further into the forest, the fog thickened, and the shadows seemed to shift once more. Talon’s pulse quickened, a sense of unease crawling up his spine. He could feel it again—that presence, lurking just beyond their sight. Watching. Waiting.

He glanced at Griffin and Sari, both of them tense, their eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of movement. They felt it too.

The Eidolons weren’t done with them yet.
