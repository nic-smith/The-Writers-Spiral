**Chapter 1: On the Run**

**A Narrow Escape**

The forest sloped downward, and Talon stumbled over the uneven ground as Sari pulled him along. His heart was still hammering in his chest, the echo of the blast from the cuff ringing in his ears. The trees stretched higher here, their twisted branches knitting together into a dense canopy that blocked out what little light remained. Everything felt suffocating—too close, too dark.

Behind them, the faint mechanical whir of the Eidolons was growing louder. The creatures moved with a precision that defied nature, their footsteps barely audible but terrifying in their regularity. They were relentless, and even the burst of energy from the cuff hadn’t slowed them down for long.

"Talon, stay with me," Sari’s voice was tense but steady, keeping him grounded. "You’re fading out again."

He blinked hard, trying to focus. The world around him was still wavering at the edges, the trees twisting and distorting as though the Veil itself was trying to swallow him. He could feel the pull of it, the same strange voice whispering in his mind, tempting him to let go.

We can show you the truth. Just let go.

Talon shook his head, the words sending a shiver down his spine. He couldn’t afford to give in. Not now. He could feel the weight of the cuff on his wrist, a dull, rhythmic pulse, but he had no idea how to control it. Every time he used it, it felt like something else was using him in return.

Griffin’s voice cut through the haze. "This way!"

Talon turned just in time to see Griffin leap across a narrow ravine, his form a shadow against the darkness of the forest. The gap wasn’t wide, but the ground on the other side sloped upward, giving them a brief advantage. Sari followed quickly, her movements agile and controlled. Talon hesitated for a heartbeat, his legs heavy with exhaustion, but the sound of the Eidolons drawing closer forced him to act.

He jumped, his foot slipping slightly on the edge of the ravine as he landed. Sari reached out, steadying him with a firm grip, her eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of their pursuers. The mechanical whirring had grown louder now, a low hum that reverberated through the air like the sound of a distant engine.

"They’re still coming," she said, her voice barely a whisper.

Talon nodded, glancing back across the ravine. For a moment, the world around him blurred again, and he saw something—**not the forest**, but something else entirely. A ruined city, the sky choked with ash, towering structures crumbling into dust. He blinked hard, forcing the image away, but the sense of unease it left behind lingered, like the aftertaste of a nightmare.

"Griffin, we can’t outrun them forever," Sari said, her voice low but urgent. "We need to think of something else."

Griffin scowled, his eyes scanning their surroundings. "There’s no time to stop and plan. We keep moving. The terrain’s in our favor now. If we can get to higher ground, we might—"

A sound cut through the air, sharp and metallic—a high-pitched **whistle** that sent a cold shiver down Talon’s spine. The first Eidolon appeared at the edge of the ravine, its long, spindly limbs glinting faintly in the dim light. It was faster than he had anticipated, its head snapping toward them with a mechanical precision that made Talon’s stomach lurch.

Another appeared beside it, then another, their forms eerily similar—angular, efficient, and utterly devoid of any human warmth. Talon felt his pulse quicken, the cuff responding with a faint thrum of energy. He didn’t have the strength to use it again, not like before. The last blast had left him drained, and he could already feel the **Veil tugging at his mind**, whispering promises he didn’t want to hear.

Griffin cursed under his breath. "We need to move. Now."

The Eidolons didn’t hesitate. With a sudden burst of speed, they leapt across the ravine, their limbs outstretched like a pack of hungry wolves. Griffin lunged forward, his knife flashing as he slashed at the first creature, but it dodged effortlessly, its movements almost fluid. Another Eidolon lunged for Sari, its elongated arm reaching out like a blade.

Talon’s breath caught in his throat as he instinctively raised his arm, the cuff glowing faintly. But before he could release its power, Sari ducked beneath the creature’s strike and kicked out hard, sending it stumbling back just enough for her to twist away. She was fast—faster than Talon had ever seen her move—but the creatures were relentless.

Griffin’s knife found its mark, sinking into the soft joint of one Eidolon’s limb. It let out a sharp, mechanical screech, but its remaining limbs lashed out, catching Griffin off guard and throwing him to the ground.

"Griffin!" Talon shouted, his voice hoarse.

The cuff hummed, the energy building inside him, but Talon hesitated. His head was pounding, his vision still blurry. If he used it again, he wasn’t sure he could stop.

But there was no time.

The Eidolons regrouped, their glowing eyes fixed on Talon now, as if they had calculated the source of the group’s power. They moved as one, circling, preparing to strike.

"Don’t—" Talon began, but it was too late.

With a sudden, coordinated leap, they lunged at him.
