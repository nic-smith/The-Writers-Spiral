Chapter 1: On the Run

The forest had become a maze of twisted trees and choking fog. Each step was harder than the last, the earth beneath their feet shifting unnaturally, as though the land itself resisted their escape. The air was heavy, thick with the remnants of the battle they had barely survived. Talon’s lungs burned as he ran, his heart pounding in his ears. The medallion against his chest pulsed in time with his racing heartbeat, as though it was alive, feeding off his fear.

“We can’t outrun them forever,” Griffin hissed, his voice barely carrying through the dense fog. His sword was still drawn, streaked with the dark residue of the Eidolons they had fought earlier. The blade gleamed faintly in the dim light, a solitary reminder of the struggle they had endured. He glanced over his shoulder at Talon, suspicion etched deep in his eyes, as though he expected Talon to betray them at any moment.

“I know,” Talon muttered under his breath, his hand brushing against the medallion. The cold metal sent a shiver through him. He could feel its power thrumming beneath his fingertips, calling to him, urging him to tap into it again. The urge gnawed at him, relentless, like an itch he couldn’t scratch. He resisted the pull, but the temptation lingered like a weight on his soul. The power was there—just a thought away. He could stop this. He could end the pursuit with a single surge of energy.

But he had seen the way Griffin looked at him. The distrust. The fear. It was enough to make him hesitate.

Ahead of them, Sari moved with an almost ethereal grace, her steps light and deliberate as she weaved through the undergrowth. Even in the near-total darkness, she seemed to find the safest path, her instincts sharper than any of theirs. Her breathing was steady, controlled, though Talon could sense the tension radiating from her. Every now and then, she would glance back, checking to make sure they were still with her, but her focus remained on finding an escape route. Talon followed her, though his mind was elsewhere—torn between the present danger and the medallion’s ever-growing pull.

The shadows of the trees seemed to stretch unnaturally, bending and warping at the edges of his vision. The fog clung to their clothes, wrapping them in its cold embrace, and every flicker of movement made Talon’s skin crawl. He could feel the medallion burning against his chest, as if the power inside it was growing stronger with each passing second, feeding on his fear and uncertainty. The further they ran, the more convinced Talon became that they were being hunted—by something far worse than the Eidolons. The air itself felt heavy, as if it were pressing down on them, suffocating them.

“We need a plan,” Sari said breathlessly as they reached a small clearing, her voice strained but steady. She stopped just long enough for Griffin and Talon to catch up, her eyes darting around the treeline for any sign of movement. The fog made it nearly impossible to see beyond a few feet, but Talon could feel the presence of something out there—something closing in on them.

“They’re closing in,” she added, barely above a whisper.

Talon’s hand hovered near the medallion. He could feel its power pulsing beneath his fingertips, a familiar, rhythmic beat that matched his own racing heart. Every second felt like an eternity, and the thought of unleashing the medallion’s power was almost comforting. It would be so easy—just a thought, just a flicker of energy, and he could end this.

“We can’t fight them off,” Griffin said, his voice low but tense, as if he were barely holding his emotions in check. His eyes flicked to Talon, sharp and accusing. “Not without losing someone.”

Talon knew what Griffin meant. The weight of his gaze was heavy, a silent accusation that lingered in the space between them. He could feel it in the way Griffin’s fingers twitched on the hilt of his sword, like he was preparing for something far worse than Eidolons. It wasn’t just about survival anymore. Griffin was afraid—afraid of him.

Talon closed his eyes for a brief moment, his thoughts racing. He could save them. He could use the medallion’s power—control it, this time. He had felt it back in the forest, the way it surged through him, giving him the strength to fend off the shadows. It hadn’t consumed him. Not fully. Maybe he could control it now. Maybe this time would be different. 

But that nagging voice in the back of his mind whispered otherwise. The memory of the **burning glyphs** etched into his skin made him hesitate. What if Griffin was right? What if the medallion was too dangerous? What if it wasn’t just power—it was a curse?

“Griffin’s right,” Sari said, breaking through his thoughts. Her voice was strained, the fear barely contained despite her best efforts. “We can’t fight them off. Not like this.”

Talon’s eyes snapped open. He had made up his mind. This wasn’t about fear or hesitation anymore. It was about survival. He could feel the pressure mounting around them, the darkness creeping closer with every breath. They didn’t have time to argue. They didn’t have time for doubt.

He reached for the medallion, his fingers brushing against the cold metal. The glyphs on his skin began to glow faintly, the light barely visible through the thick fog. But Talon felt the surge of power instantly, coursing through him like a bolt of lightning. It was intoxicating, overwhelming. For a moment, he felt unstoppable. He told himself it was for the group. He told himself he was in control.

He had to be.

The forest around them seemed to still, as if the world itself were holding its breath, waiting for what would come next. Talon clenched his jaw, his heart racing as he prepared to unleash the medallion’s power. The darkness was closing in, and with it, the unmistakable presence of the Eidolons—twisting shadows, stalking them through the mist.

But this time, Talon wouldn’t run. He wouldn’t hesitate.

The medallion pulsed one last time.

And Talon let go.
