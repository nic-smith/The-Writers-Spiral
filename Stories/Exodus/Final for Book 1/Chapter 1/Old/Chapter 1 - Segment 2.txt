Chapter 1: On the Run

The moment Talon released the medallion’s power, the forest seemed to shift. The air around them vibrated, humming with the dark energy he had unleashed. The oppressive fog that had clung to the trees was suddenly pulled inward, spiraling around them like a vortex. The shadows lengthened, twisting unnaturally, as if the very fabric of the world had been disturbed by the medallion’s touch.

Sari gasped, stepping back instinctively. She glanced at Talon, her eyes wide with alarm. “Talon, what are you—”

Before she could finish, the darkness exploded.

The Eidolons, once distant, lunged forward from the shadows with renewed ferocity. Their forms were more defined now—no longer just shapeless masses of black smoke, but creatures with jagged edges and gleaming, razor-sharp claws. They moved faster, more deliberately, as if Talon’s use of the medallion had made them stronger.

Griffin was the first to react. He let out a sharp cry, swinging his sword with practiced precision. His blade met the closest Eidolon with a sickening hiss as it cut through the creature’s ethereal form, but the impact barely slowed it down. The Eidolon’s claws raked across Griffin’s arm, tearing through fabric and skin. Griffin cursed, staggering back as blood splattered onto the ground.

“Damn it, Talon!” he shouted, his voice filled with both pain and fury. “What did you do?!”

Talon’s breath came in ragged bursts as he tried to focus on the medallion. His heart raced, the power coursing through him with an intensity that made it hard to think clearly. He could feel the medallion’s grip tightening, as if it had become a part of him. The world around him blurred, his vision flickering between reality and something else—something alien, twisted, and ancient. He could see the outline of the Eidolons more clearly now, their bodies marked with the same glyphs that burned on his skin.

The power was intoxicating, but it was slipping out of his control.

Sari was fighting off two Eidolons at once, her daggers flashing in the faint light as she weaved between them with graceful precision. But Talon could see the strain in her movements. The creatures were relentless, their attacks faster and more coordinated than before. She was skilled, but she couldn’t hold them off forever.

“Talon!” Griffin’s voice rang out again, pulling him back to the present. He was fending off another creature, but his movements were slower, more desperate. Blood dripped from his wounded arm, and his breath was ragged.

Talon’s mind raced. He had to do something. He had to stop this.

He reached for the medallion again, but the moment his fingers brushed against it, a wave of pain shot through him. The glyphs on his skin flared to life, burning hotter than before. His vision blurred, the world around him spinning. He stumbled, his knees buckling beneath him as the power surged out of control.

The forest seemed to bend and warp, the trees twisting like living things. The ground beneath him shifted, trembling as though the earth itself was reacting to the medallion’s power. Talon’s head pounded, the whispers growing louder, more insistent, as if they were trying to tell him something—but he couldn’t understand.

He fell to his knees, gasping for breath as the weight of the medallion pressed down on him. The pain was unbearable, but he couldn’t let go. Not now. Not when everything depended on him.

“Talon, stop!” Sari’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and commanding. She fought her way toward him, her movements quick and fluid, despite the creatures still circling them. “You’re losing control!”

He could barely hear her. The medallion’s pull was too strong, the power too overwhelming. He was slipping—falling deeper into the Veil’s grasp. The line between reality and whatever the medallion showed him blurred until he could no longer tell which was which.

But even through the haze, he could hear Sari’s voice, firm and insistent. “Talon! You have to stop!”

With a supreme effort, Talon wrenched his hand away from the medallion. The moment he let go, the power ebbed, retreating back into the cold metal like a receding wave. His body trembled, the glyphs on his skin dimming to a faint glow. The world around him slowly stabilized, the trees returning to their twisted but familiar shapes. The ground beneath him stilled, though it still felt unsteady.

The Eidolons hesitated, their movements faltering as if the sudden loss of energy had disoriented them. Griffin didn’t waste a second. He lunged forward, his sword slashing through the nearest creature with renewed force, cutting it down before it could recover. Sari followed suit, her daggers moving in a blur as she took down the remaining two.

Talon collapsed onto his hands, his breath coming in shallow gasps. His body ached, and the medallion’s weight felt heavier than ever, pressing against his chest like a curse. He could feel the burn of the glyphs still etched into his skin, a constant reminder of the power he had tapped into—and the danger it posed.

Griffin approached him, his face a mask of barely restrained fury. Blood dripped from the wound on his arm, but he didn’t seem to care. His gaze was locked on Talon, eyes filled with accusation.

“What the hell were you thinking?” Griffin’s voice was low, but the anger in it was unmistakable. “You almost killed us.”

Talon tried to speak, but his throat felt dry, his voice barely a whisper. “I thought…I could control it.”

“Control it?” Griffin scoffed, stepping closer, his fists clenched. “You’re going to get us all killed.”

Sari stood nearby, her expression torn between worry and frustration. “Griffin, stop,” she said softly, though her voice was strained. “Talon’s trying. We all are.”

Griffin shook his head, his jaw clenched. “He’s not just trying—he’s risking all of our lives every time he touches that thing.” He pointed at the medallion, his eyes narrowing. “You need to make a choice, Talon. Either you control it, or it controls you.”

Talon lowered his head, his body shaking from the effort of keeping the medallion’s power at bay. He knew Griffin was right, but the words still stung. The truth was, he didn’t know if he could control it. Not anymore.

And as the last of the Eidolons dissolved into the shadows, Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that this was just the beginning.
