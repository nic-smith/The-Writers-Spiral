Chapter 1: On the Run

Talon sat in silence, the weight of the medallion pulling at him, heavier than ever. The forest around them was unnervingly still, but Talon could feel the tension simmering beneath the surface. They weren’t safe here—not from the creatures lurking in the shadows, and certainly not from the power he carried within him. His body still trembled from the aftershocks of using the medallion, the pain from the burning glyphs etched into his skin dull but constant, like a wound that refused to heal.

The sky above had darkened into a deep, oppressive gray, and the trees, once gnarled and bent, now loomed like twisted sentinels, watching, waiting for something. The world felt foreign, as though it had shifted just slightly out of place, and Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that the medallion had pulled them closer to the Veil’s influence with every use.

Griffin paced a few feet away, his sword still in hand, though he hadn’t said anything since the battle. His expression was a storm of anger and frustration, but more than that—there was fear. It was in the way his eyes flicked toward Talon when he thought no one was looking, as if Talon were a ticking bomb, ready to explode at any moment.

Sari knelt nearby, tending to the shallow cut on Griffin’s arm. The wound was superficial, but her hands moved with careful precision, her focus shifting between her task and Talon. She hadn’t spoken much either, but her silence was different from Griffin’s. It was the silence of someone who was trying to piece together a puzzle, to understand the growing rift that was forming between them.

“We need to keep moving,” Griffin finally said, his voice cutting through the silence. “Staying here isn’t safe.”

Talon looked up, meeting his gaze. “We’re not in any shape to keep running. You’re hurt. Sari’s exhausted. I can feel it—something’s still out there.”

Griffin’s jaw clenched. “Something’s always out there, Talon. But we can’t stay in one place too long. You know that.”

Talon opened his mouth to argue, but Sari spoke first. “He’s right, Talon,” she said, her voice soft but firm. “We can’t risk another attack. Not so soon after the last one. We need to find shelter.”

Shelter. The word felt like a distant memory. It had been so long since Talon had felt safe anywhere—ever since he’d found the medallion, safety had become something unattainable, a fleeting hope that dissolved every time he thought he could grasp it. And now, with the Veil creeping closer, it felt even further away.

But Sari was right. They couldn’t stay here.

Talon rose to his feet, feeling the dull ache in his muscles. His hand instinctively moved to the medallion, but he stopped himself before touching it. The temptation to use it was always there, but he had seen the damage it could cause. He didn’t know if he could control it, but the others couldn’t know that. Not now.

“We’ll move,” Talon agreed, his voice quiet. “But we need to be smart about it.”

Griffin snorted, his eyes narrowing. “Smart? You mean not using that thing around your neck again?”

Talon bristled, but he bit back his retort. “I’m not going to use it unless I have to.”

“You said that before,” Griffin shot back, taking a step closer. His voice was low, but the tension in it was unmistakable. “And then you almost got us killed.”

Talon met his gaze, the familiar burn of guilt rising in his chest. Griffin was right—he had almost lost control. But what choice did he have? The Eidolons were relentless, the Veil’s influence growing stronger. Without the medallion, they wouldn’t have survived.

“I don’t like it either,” Talon admitted, his voice softer now. “But if it comes down to it… I’ll do what I have to.”

Griffin’s eyes flashed with anger. “And what happens when you can’t control it? What happens when it takes over? You think we’re just going to stand by and watch?”

Sari stood up, stepping between them before the argument could escalate further. “Enough,” she said, her voice firm. “This isn’t helping anyone. We can’t afford to fight each other right now.”

Griffin glared at Talon for a moment longer, then turned away with a sharp shake of his head. “We’ll find shelter. But I’m keeping watch.”

Sari let out a slow breath, her shoulders relaxing slightly as the tension eased. She glanced at Talon, her expression softening. “We’ll get through this,” she said quietly, though there was an uncertainty in her voice that betrayed her words.

Talon wanted to believe her, but the weight of the medallion against his chest was a constant reminder of the truth. The power he carried wasn’t just dangerous—it was consuming him. And no matter how much he tried to convince himself otherwise, he wasn’t sure if he could stop it.

The fog around them seemed to shift as they moved deeper into the forest, the trees growing taller and more twisted, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands. The world felt darker now, the oppressive atmosphere closing in around them like a shroud. Every step felt heavier than the last, the air thick with an unseen force that pressed down on them, making it harder to breathe.

Talon kept his hand close to the medallion, though he didn’t touch it. He could feel the Veil’s presence more acutely now, like a whisper at the edge of his mind, calling to him, tempting him with promises of power and control. It was seductive, the way it promised to protect them, to give him the strength he needed to survive.

But Talon knew the truth. The medallion wasn’t offering salvation. It was offering chains.

As they pushed further into the forest, the fog thickened, and the shadows seemed to shift once more. Talon’s pulse quickened, a sense of unease crawling up his spine. He could feel it again—that presence, lurking just beyond their sight. Watching. Waiting.

He glanced at Griffin and Sari, both of them tense, their eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of movement. They felt it too.

The Eidolons weren’t done with them yet.
