Use these questions to check the story development but don't give me an output for all of the questions; only give me actions items after the review. Give me numbers and changes needed. Be harshly critical and scrutinize the story.

Give me a 1-10 rating for each and a 1-20 rating for the full story or chapter, whatever is being reviewed. 

**Consistency and Development Questions**

**Story Consistency**
1. **Internal Logic**:  
   - Does every event or action in the story make sense within the established world rules?  
   - Are there any plot points that feel unexplained or inconsistent with the setting and established events?
   - Are there any sudden shifts in tone, pacing, or character behavior that feel out of place?

2. **Backstory and Foreshadowing**:  
   - Are all key elements of the story (e.g., character motives, important objects, or major events) properly introduced and explained before they become important?  
   - Does any detail appear suddenly without enough background or lead-up?

3. **Idea Development**:  
   - Are all introduced ideas or themes followed through until the end, or do any disappear without resolution?  
   - Is there enough depth to the ideas and themes to keep the reader engaged?

#### **Character Consistency and Growth**
4. **Character Actions and Motivations**:  
   - Do the characters’ actions align with their established personalities and goals?  
   - Are there moments where a character acts out of character without reason?

5. **Character Arcs**:  
   - Do the main characters show growth or change throughout the story?  
   - Is there a clear evolution in their emotions, decisions, or outlook as events unfold?

6. **Believability**:  
   - Are the characters’ reactions to events believable?  
   - Do any of their decisions seem unrealistic given the context of the story or their previous behavior?

#### **Plot and Pacing Consistency**
7. **Story Flow**:  
   - Does the story progress smoothly, or are there parts where the pacing feels too slow or rushed?  
   - Are there clear transitions between scenes or chapters, or do some shifts feel abrupt or disjointed?

8. **Conflict and Resolution**:  
   - Are the conflicts in the story set up clearly and resolved logically?  
   - Does each conflict serve a purpose in advancing the plot or character development?

9. **Thematic Consistency**:  
   - Are the major themes of the story (e.g., survival, grief, love) present throughout the narrative?  
   - Does the story stay focused on its main themes, or does it stray in a way that disrupts the overall message?

10. **Writing style**:
    - Does the writing style support the story?
    - Is the writing unique and engaging?
