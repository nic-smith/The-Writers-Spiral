To streamline your writing process and create an efficient loop using the prompt, here's a refined approach for the prompt that focuses on achieving your desired workflow:

### Writing Prompt:
1. **Write the Next Half Chapter**:  
   Write the next half chapter of the story without outputting the text itself. This will generate the content for evaluation.
   
2. **Evaluate the Writing**:  
   Run a critique using the **Comprehensive Story Review Questions**, assessing each section. Do not output detailed feedback yet.
   
3. **Score Calculation**:  
   Based on the critique, calculate an overall score from 1 to 20. Also, identify the biggest weakness in the half chapter (such as pacing, character development, or conflict). Track the word count.

4. **Output Results**:  
   Output only the following:
   - The overall score (1-20)
   - The word count
   - The biggest weakness identified

5. **Rewrite Process**:  
   Rewrite the half chapter with a specific focus on addressing the identified weakness. Incorporate improvements based on the critique.

6. **Loop**:  
   Repeat the critique and rewriting process for a total of 5 loops, refining the chapter each time.

7. **Final Output**:  
   After 5 loops, output:
   - Final score
   - Word count
   - Final feedback
   - The full half chapter text

### Key Considerations:
- Keep the rewriting and critique process focused on improving based on each feedback loop.
- The automation helps you quickly evaluate the story without halting the creative process, leading to a polished draft in minimal time.

This approach will help you achieve an efficient writing flow while improving the quality of each section incrementally. Would you like any further adjustments or ideas?
