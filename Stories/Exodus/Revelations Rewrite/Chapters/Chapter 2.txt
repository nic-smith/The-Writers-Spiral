Chapter 2: The Cabin.

[P28] The air inside the cabin was thick, stale with the scent of damp wood and decay. Dust floated through the beams of weak light that seeped in through cracks in the walls, illuminating patches of the room in thin, uneven streaks. Talon took a cautious step forward, his gaze sweeping across the sparse, forgotten remains of whoever had once lived here.

[P29] A broken lantern lay on a table, its glass cracked and splintered. The floor was littered with debris—bits of rotting fabric, dried leaves, and splinters of wood that crunched underfoot. Talon felt a shiver crawl up his spine as he stepped deeper into the room, the silence pressing down on him, heavy and unyielding.

[P30] Griffin entered next, his eyes scanning every corner, every shadow, his grip tight on his knife. “Great,” he muttered, his voice low. “We’ve traded the open forest for a place that’s barely holding itself together.”

[P31] Sari moved past him, her expression thoughtful as she ran her fingers over the cracked surface of an old table. “It’s still shelter. At least we won’t be out in the rain… if it rains.” She looked over at Talon, a glint of quiet curiosity in her eyes. “What do you think?”

[P32] Talon didn’t answer immediately. There was something strange about this place, something he couldn’t put into words. It felt… familiar, in a way that was unsettling, as if he’d seen it before, maybe in his vision or in a memory he couldn’t quite reach.

[P33] “It’s better than nothing,” he said finally, though his voice lacked conviction. “At least we can rest.”

[P34] Griffin snorted, but he said nothing, moving further into the room as he inspected their surroundings. He kicked at a pile of crumbling leaves in the corner, his face wrinkling in distaste as a cloud of dust rose into the air.

[P35] They moved through the cabin, each of them exploring different corners, their footsteps quiet on the creaking floorboards. Sari opened a cupboard by the wall, finding only rusted cans and empty jars coated in dust. Griffin tested one of the chairs, finding it barely able to support his weight before he stepped back, his face a mask of resignation.

[P36] “Place has been abandoned for a while,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. “Whoever was here left in a hurry… or didn’t have a chance to pack up.”

[P37] Talon felt a strange chill at Griffin’s words. He didn’t know why, but something about the cabin felt… wrong. It was more than just the decay, more than the dust and the disarray. It was as if the place held memories, shadows of lives once lived, lingering in the silence like ghosts.

[P38] As he moved deeper into the room, something caught his eye—a small, half-buried shape under a pile of torn cloth in the corner. He knelt down, brushing aside the fabric, his fingers closing around the cool leather of a worn book.

[P39] He lifted it carefully, feeling the weight of it in his hands. The cover was cracked and faded, the initials “D.H.” barely legible, etched in dark ink that had begun to blur with time. A shiver ran through him as he traced the letters, a sense of recognition settling over him like a shadow.

[P40] “What is that?” Sari’s voice was soft, almost hesitant, as she came to stand beside him.

[P41] Talon looked up, meeting her gaze. “A journal, I think. Belonged to whoever was here last.”

[P42] Griffin’s eyes narrowed as he stepped closer, his expression unreadable. “You think it has anything useful? Or is it just more… memories?”

[P43] Talon hesitated, his fingers brushing over the edges of the worn pages. “There’s only one way to find out.”

[P44] He opened the journal carefully, the pages brittle and yellowed, the ink faded but still legible. The handwriting was cramped and hurried, scrawled in dark lines that looked more like scratches than letters. He scanned the first page, his heart pounding as he read the words.

[P45] “‘The forest is alive. I thought it would be safe here, but it watches, waits. Shadows move in the night, and there are whispers I can’t ignore. I am not alone. The Veil is not protection—it’s a curse. And it’s calling me… drawing the darkness closer.’”

[P46] The words settled over them like a thick, heavy fog, each line a whisper of dread that seemed to echo in the silence.

[P47] Sari’s face was pale, her gaze fixed on the journal as though it held some unspeakable truth. “He… really believed something was out there.”

[P48] Griffin crossed his arms, his jaw set in a hard line. “Or he was just losing his mind. Being out here alone could do that to anyone.” But there was a hint of unease in his voice, a flicker of doubt that he couldn’t quite hide.

[P49] Talon felt the weight of the journal in his hands, the words echoing in his mind, mingling with the memory of his vision. He didn’t know why, but he felt a strange connection to this person, this “D.H.” It was as if their paths had crossed somehow, bound together by the same invisible thread that had drawn him into the forest.

[P50] “Whether he was losing his mind or not… he saw something,” Talon said quietly, his voice barely more than a whisper. “Something that scared him enough to leave this behind.”

[P51] Griffin’s face tightened, his gaze shifting to the medallion hanging around Talon’s neck. “You really think we’re supposed to trust the ravings of some stranger? This whole place feels like a trap, Talon. We’re walking into something we don’t understand.”

[P52] Talon met Griffin’s gaze, feeling the weight of his doubt pressing down on him. “I don’t expect you to understand, Griffin. But I can’t ignore this. It’s like… the medallion brought us here. It’s connected somehow.”

[P53] Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s arm, her touch grounding him, her gaze filled with quiet resolve. “Then we keep reading. Maybe… maybe there’s something here that can help us.”

[P54] Griffin looked away, his jaw clenched, but he said nothing more. The silence stretched between them, thick and unyielding, as they settled into the cabin, the journal’s words lingering in their minds like a dark, unspoken warning.

[P55] The light outside began to fade, casting long shadows across the cabin floor as evening approached. Talon continued reading, his voice low as he skimmed through the pages, each entry a glimpse into the mind of someone haunted by the same darkness that seemed to press in around them.

[P56] “‘I thought I could escape it,’” he read aloud, his voice steady but quiet. “‘But the Veil follows. It’s a gate, not a shield. And it draws the shadows near, as if they recognize its call. There is no safe place, no sanctuary. Only the silence… and the darkness.’”

[P57] A shiver ran through Sari as she listened, her face pale in the dim light. “He really believed… he was being hunted.”

[P58] Griffin crossed his arms, his voice a low murmur. “Doesn’t mean he was right. The forest plays tricks. Makes you see things that aren’t there.” But even as he spoke, his eyes flicked to the window, a hint of unease flickering in his gaze.

[P59] The words lingered in the silence, filling the cabin with a weight that seemed to seep into the walls. Talon could feel the medallion pressing against his chest, its pull stronger than ever, as though it, too, recognized the words scrawled in the journal, a silent echo of the same call that had brought them here.

[P60] The room grew darker as the last light faded from the sky, and a sense of foreboding settled over them, heavy and unrelenting. Talon closed the journal, his fingers tracing the initials on the cover one last time before he set it down beside him.

[P61] As they prepared to settle in for the night, a quiet unease filled the cabin, each of them haunted by the words they’d read and the shadows that seemed to gather just beyond the walls.

[P62] In the silence, Talon could almost hear the whispers again, faint and elusive, calling to him from somewhere deep within the forest. The Veil was waiting, and whatever lay beyond it, he knew, was far from anything they could imagine.

[P63] Rain began to fall just as darkness swallowed the last traces of daylight, pounding against the cabin’s roof with a relentless rhythm. The wind howled outside, whipping through the trees and rattling the loose shutters, filling the air with a sound that was somewhere between a whisper and a scream. Talon sat by the window, watching as sheets of rain blurred the forest beyond, transforming the trees into twisted, half-seen shadows.

[P64] The walls creaked with each gust, as though the cabin itself were alive, breathing in time with the storm. Talon pulled his cloak tighter around his shoulders, feeling the cold seep into his bones despite the flimsy protection. The medallion lay heavy against his chest, its metal warm against his skin, a steady weight that seemed to pulse with the same rhythm as the rain outside.

[P65] Sari sat cross-legged beside him, her gaze fixed on the journal in his lap. “So… what else does it say?” she asked quietly, her voice barely more than a whisper, as though speaking too loudly might break whatever spell had settled over them.

[P66] Talon hesitated, his fingers tracing the worn edges of the journal. Each entry felt like a piece of someone else’s fear, an echo of a life lived in shadow. But there was a pull in the words, a dark fascination that kept drawing him back.

[P67] “It’s more of the same, mostly,” he murmured, his voice low. “Whoever D.H. was, he thought… or knew… that the Veil was dangerous. That it called things to him. Shadows, or something worse.”

[P68] Griffin leaned against the far wall, his face cast in shadow as he watched them. “Or maybe he was just going crazy,” he muttered, his tone thick with doubt. “This place would do that to anyone.”

[P69] But even as he spoke, a flicker of unease crossed his face. The rain continued to beat against the cabin, the sound merging with the wind, filling the silence with an eerie, rhythmic pulse.

[P70] As the storm raged on, the cabin grew colder, the wind slipping through the cracks and sending a damp chill over them. Sari rose and began pacing the small room, rubbing her arms for warmth as she looked around. Her gaze fell on an old cupboard in the corner, its door hanging open to reveal a scattering of forgotten items: a tarnished fork, a broken mirror, and a pile of clothes, yellowed and frayed with age.

[P71] “Someone really did live here,” she murmured, almost to herself, as she lifted the mirror. Its surface was scratched, the reflection barely more than a ghostly blur. She set it down, moving to the pile of clothes, her fingers brushing over the rough fabric.

[P72] Griffin’s eyes followed her movements, his face a mask of suspicion. “You think whoever was here just… left? Or maybe they didn’t get the chance.”

[P73] Talon felt a shiver run through him at Griffin’s words. He looked down at the journal, his mind racing with images of the person who had written those desperate words, someone haunted by shadows and whispers, trapped in a place that had promised safety but delivered only isolation and fear.

[P74] “I don’t think he left,” Talon said softly, his voice barely audible over the storm. “Or if he did… it wasn’t by choice.”

[P75] Sari looked over at him, her expression tense. “What makes you say that?”

[P76] Talon glanced down at the journal, his fingers brushing over the initials on the cover. “Because he kept writing, even when he was scared. It’s like he thought… like he thought someone would find this one day. Like he was leaving a warning.”

[P77] Griffin shifted, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. “Well, if he was, it’s not much of one. Shadows, whispers, curses—it sounds more like a ghost story than anything real.”

[P78] Sari looked back at the cupboard, her gaze settling on a small, crumpled photograph peeking out from under the pile of clothes. She pulled it free, squinting at the faded image—a man, younger than she’d expected, with a shadowy figure beside him, both of their faces blurred with time.

[P79] “Look,” she whispered, holding the photograph up to the dim light. “Could this be D.H.?”

[P80] Talon took the photograph from her, his heart pounding as he examined the faces. The man looked weary, his eyes shadowed and distant, as though he’d already seen too much. The other figure was more indistinct, barely visible, a smudge of darkness that seemed to fade into the background. He couldn’t shake the feeling that this was more than just a photograph—it was a memory, a fragment of someone else’s life caught in a moment of clarity and fear.

[P81] “Maybe,” he said quietly, setting the photograph back down. “But whoever they were… they didn’t make it out.”

[P82] The rain had finally slowed, leaving the air thick and damp, heavy with the scent of wet earth and pine. As dawn broke, a cold, pale light crept through the gaps in the cabin’s walls, casting faint shadows across the worn floorboards. Talon sat up slowly, running a hand over his face, the remnants of fractured dreams still lingering at the edge of his mind.

[P83] Sari was already awake, crouched by the small pile of supplies they’d gathered. She glanced over as Talon rose, her expression a mix of exhaustion and quiet determination. “We should get moving soon,” she murmured, her voice barely more than a whisper. “The storm’s passed, but… I don’t think this place will ever feel safe.”

[P84] Griffin, leaning against the doorframe, nodded grimly. “Agreed. It was a roof over our heads for a night, but that’s about all it offered.” He slipped his dagger back into its sheath and cast a wary look out into the forest, his face hardening. “Let’s not stick around to see what else might be out there.”

[P85] Talon reached for the journal, his fingers brushing over the worn initials one last time before he slipped it into his pack. The medallion pressed against his chest, its weight both a comfort and a reminder of the path they couldn’t turn away from.

[P86] As they stepped outside, the forest greeted them in a shroud of mist, the trees looming like silent sentinels. The ground was slick with mud, their boots sinking with each step as they moved forward, leaving the fragile safety of the cabin behind. Every sound seemed amplified in the thick silence—the drip of water from branches, the squelch of mud, the quiet rustle of leaves—all blending into a quiet, haunting rhythm that pulsed through the forest.

[P87] Talon felt the pull of the medallion, steady and insistent, guiding him deeper into the trees. The sense of foreboding settled over him once more, heavier than before, as though the forest itself were watching, waiting.

[P88] They walked on, their figures disappearing into the shadows, the cabin fading behind them like a memory, swallowed by the endless depths of the woods.
