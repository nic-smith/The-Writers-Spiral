- **Summary:**

Elias “Eli” Rivas is a reclusive former business mogul who escaped the rat race to focus on meaningful, personal projects. His quiet, rugged demeanor gives him a magnetic presence, and his unwavering moral code draws others to him—particularly those in need of guidance, like Talon. Eli sees potential in those who show resilience and honesty, offering mentorship in a way that’s both tough and transformative. He’s a man who leads through indirect action, nudging others to grow by example.
