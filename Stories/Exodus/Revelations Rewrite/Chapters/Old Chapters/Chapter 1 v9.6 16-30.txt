[P16]
Griffin’s voice was low, edged with frustration. “Are we even going in the right direction? You talk about this feeling, but all we’ve done is wander aimlessly. What are we even looking for, Talon? Are we just chasing shadows?” His tone held an accusatory edge, a bitterness born from days of uncertainty and dwindling supplies.

[P17]
Talon hesitated, his fingers instinctively wrapping around the medallion. The cool weight pressed against his chest, grounding him in its presence, even as doubt clawed at his mind. He took a deep breath. “I don’t know exactly,” he admitted, feeling the vulnerability of his words. “But I can’t shake this… this pull. It’s something I can’t ignore.”

[P18]
Sari stepped forward, placing a steadying hand on Talon’s shoulder. Her gaze was intense, her voice low. “We trust you, Talon,” she said, casting a brief look toward Griffin. “Even if we don’t understand it fully. Just… don’t lose yourself in this.”

[P19]
Griffin scoffed, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. “Trust doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. Food does. Water does. Shelter does. And right now, we’re running low on all of those.” His words were a stark reminder of the danger they faced, a cold dose of reality that cut through Talon’s sense of purpose.

[P20]
The silence that followed was heavy, the weight of Griffin’s words settling over them like a dark cloud. Talon felt his resolve waver, a flicker of doubt that he quickly suppressed. The medallion still pulsed against his chest, an unyielding call that he couldn’t ignore. He looked at his friends, seeing the fatigue and unease in their faces, but he forced himself to speak. “We’re close—I can feel it. Just a little further.”

[P21]
They continued onward, Griffin’s skepticism simmering in the background, Sari’s silent encouragement a steady presence beside Talon. The forest grew denser, the path narrowing as thorned branches reached out like skeletal fingers, snagging on their clothes, leaving scratches on exposed skin. Every sound seemed amplified—the snap of a twig, the rustle of leaves—as though the forest itself were alive and observing them.

[P22]
The light dimmed as the sun sank lower, casting an eerie glow over the forest. Shadows lengthened, stretching out from the trees to merge with the underbrush, creating a labyrinthine world of dark and light. Talon’s grip on the medallion tightened as his vision from earlier flickered in his mind, a reminder of the ancient structures and hollow eyes that had stared back at him from the otherworldly landscape.

[P23]
Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the trees, carrying with it a strange, metallic scent that prickled the back of Talon’s throat. He paused, his heart pounding as the medallion grew colder against his skin, an ominous chill settling over him. Sari and Griffin halted, sensing the change in the atmosphere. They exchanged glances, the unspoken question hanging heavy between them.

[P24]
Sari’s voice broke the silence, barely a whisper. “Do you feel that?” Her hand went to the hilt of her blade, fingers tightening around it as her gaze swept the trees. The usual sounds of the forest—bird calls, the rustle of leaves—had faded, replaced by an unsettling quiet that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

[P25]
Griffin glanced at Talon, his face etched with suspicion and a trace of fear. “This medallion of yours—are you sure it’s guiding us? Or are we just wandering into some… trap?” His words were laced with accusation, yet beneath them lay an unspoken plea for reassurance.

[P26]
Talon swallowed, feeling the weight of their trust pressing down on him. The medallion’s pull was undeniable, a force that defied explanation, but his own doubts gnawed at him, a relentless whisper that questioned his every step. “I… I don’t know,” he said, his voice barely audible. The words felt like a confession, a crack in the resolve he had clung to since the journey began.

[P27]
Griffin let out a bitter laugh, his frustration spilling over. “That’s just great, Talon. We’re out here, starving and thirsty, following something you ‘don’t know.’” His tone was sharp, laced with a resentment that had been simmering since they’d entered the forest. “Maybe you should take a hard look at that medallion before it gets us all killed.”

[P28]
Sari stepped between them, her gaze steady as she met Griffin’s. “Enough,” she said firmly. “We’re all tired, but turning on each other isn’t going to help us now.” Her eyes flicked to Talon, a silent reassurance that cut through the tension. “We’ve come this far together. Let’s not lose sight of that.”

[P29]
The silence between them lingered, thick and tense, but they pushed forward. Every step seemed to sink deeper into the forest’s hold, each breath feeling more labored. The last rays of sunlight faded, casting the woods in a muted, gray light that barely pierced the dense foliage. Talon kept his gaze ahead, trying to ignore Griffin’s lingering glare and Sari’s quiet resolve. He could feel the medallion’s pull growing stronger, almost as if it were urging him to hurry.

[P30]
As they trudged onward, Griffin’s voice cut through the stillness once more. “We should make camp,” he said, the edge of anger gone, replaced by fatigue. “We’re low on everything, and we’re not going to last much longer if we don’t rest.” The exhaustion in his voice was echoed in his face, the harsh lines of frustration softened by weariness.
