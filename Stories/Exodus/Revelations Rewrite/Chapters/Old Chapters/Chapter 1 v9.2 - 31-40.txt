As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, the forest grew darker, the shadows lengthening and merging into a solid wall of black. The air felt heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves, and Talon found it harder to breathe, as if the forest itself was pressing down on them, tightening around them like a noose.

#### **[P32]**
“We need to make camp while we still have light,” Griffin said bluntly, but Talon caught sight of something in the distance. A shape that did not fit the pattern of the forest. He started to speed up toward the shape, leaving Griffin and Sari to run to catch up.

#### **[P33]**
Just as they caught up to him, he broke into a run. Sari, jogging behind him, finally saw what he saw and broke into a joyful giggle. “Is that…?” she exclaimed just as Talon came to a sudden halt.

#### **[P34]**
The oppressive doubt he felt inside melted away, replaced by a giddy fervor. Half-hidden by twisted branches and thick undergrowth stood a rundown old cabin, alone and decaying, its walls warped and broken in places, its roof sagging under the weight of time.

#### **[P35]**
Sari let out a breath, her voice filled with a mixture of relief and caution. “Is that…?”

#### **[P36]**
Talon nodded, his heart pounding as he took a step closer. “Looks like shelter.”

#### **[P37]**
Griffin’s expression was unreadable as he moved forward, scanning the area around the cabin with a wary gaze. “Or a trap,” he muttered, his voice barely more than a whisper.

#### **[P38]**
But even as he spoke, Talon felt a strange sense of familiarity, as though the cabin had been waiting for them all along, hidden deep within the forest’s dark embrace.

#### **[P39]**
As they reached the cabin’s entrance, a chill ran down Talon’s spine. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were crossing a threshold, stepping into a place that was both sanctuary and prison.

#### **[P40]**
Pushing open the door, Talon stepped inside, the musty air wrapping around them like a thick blanket. Dust motes danced in the slanting light that filtered through the cracked windows. It was as if they were entering a forgotten world, one that held the secrets of the past and the promise of the unknown.
