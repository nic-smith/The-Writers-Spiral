Prologue: Echoes of the Unbroken Cycle

---

A storm of darkness unfurled around Talon, swallowing sight, sound, and sense until he was adrift in an ocean of shadows. There was no ground, no sky, only a void where twisted forms surged and receded like waves. And at the heart of it all, a voice—not one he heard with his ears, but one that echoed inside him, as though it had taken root in his bones.

*The cycle remains unbroken.*

The words tore through him, raw and ancient, leaving a hollow ache in their wake. He clutched at the medallion hanging against his chest, the cold biting into his skin, sharper than iron, more consuming than ice. In that endless dark, it pulsed in time with his heartbeat, an anchor that felt as much a curse as it did a lifeline.

Around him, the shadows twisted, forming images that clawed at the edges of his mind. Shattered landscapes of barren earth stretched endlessly, broken by jagged ruins that jutted from the ground like the bones of forgotten gods. Skies bled with crimson light, roiling with clouds that pulsed as if alive, veins of darkness threading through them. Skeletal figures littered the land, their limbs twisted and reaching toward a distant monolith—a silhouette that loomed impossibly high, rising from the earth like a vast, malevolent throne.

And upon it sat Metis.

Talon’s gaze was drawn to the figure, unable to look away, though every instinct screamed at him to turn, to flee. Metis was vast, a form that seemed to shift and seethe, built from the shadows and deeper than the void itself. The figure had no face, only a swirling mass of features that shifted constantly—eyes, mouths, hollow sockets—appearing and vanishing, a grotesque reflection of life twisted into something alien and monstrous.

A pulse of cold radiated from the medallion, sharper, more insistent, almost alive. Talon’s fingers tightened around it, his knuckles white as he tried to ground himself, but the medallion seemed to draw him deeper into the vision, binding him to it. He could feel it now—a weight pressing against his mind, as though the medallion was merging with his thoughts, filling them with something ancient and hungry.

The voice returned, stronger, louder, reverberating through him.

*Bound by ancient ruin, a fate sealed in shadows. The cycle must end.*

He staggered, though there was no ground to stumble upon. The words wrapped around him like chains, each syllable a blow that struck at his core. His heart pounded, the cold of the medallion burrowing deeper, and he felt his sense of self fray, slipping into the dark where the words waited, hungry and unyielding.

In the distance, the skeletal figures began to move, twisting and contorting as they dragged themselves toward the monolith. Their limbs cracked and snapped, bending at impossible angles, their mouths open in silent screams that reverberated through the void. Their forms flickered in and out, half-alive, half-shadow, beings caught between worlds.

The medallion pulsed harder, and Talon’s vision blurred, shapes merging and fracturing around him. He could feel something building inside the dark—a force, a truth, something that clawed at his mind with jagged nails. It wanted him to understand, to surrender to the weight of it.

*The ruin knows you. The ruin binds you.*

Each word was a hammer, beating against his mind, a litany that grew louder, more consuming. He felt himself fragmenting, pieces of himself breaking off and dissipating into the endless black, and the terror of it froze him. He was dissolving, drawn into the medallion’s pull, into Metis’s will, into the prophecy that tethered him to this cycle.

He tried to scream, to force sound from his throat, but the void swallowed it. There was no release, no escape—only the ever-tightening grip of the medallion, the weight of fate settling into his bones.

And then, for the first time, the vision broke, his consciousness skittering to the edge, clinging desperately as a single image burned itself into his mind. A hand—his own, bloody and trembling—reaching out to grasp a thread of light, only for it to slip through his fingers.

He awoke with a gasp, drenched in cold sweat, the medallion searing against his chest.

Talon’s gasp hung in the silence, his chest heaving as he clawed his way back to reality. The medallion rested heavily against him, cold and unyielding, like a shard of ice pressed into his skin. He forced himself to breathe, to steady the hammering of his heart, but the images from the vision clung to him, refusing to fade. Metis. The monolith. The empty faces in the ruins.

The shadows around him seemed darker now, as though the vision had peeled back a layer of the world, revealing something ancient, watching.

He gripped the medallion, feeling the sharp edge bite into his palm, grounding himself in the pain. There was something about its weight—both physical and intangible—that felt like a tether, binding him to a fate he barely understood. And yet, he couldn’t shake the sense that it wasn’t just a link; it was a prison, locking him into a path from which there was no escape.

The prophecy whispered to him still, a dark hum beneath his thoughts, words woven into the fabric of his mind. *Bound by ancient ruin. A fate sealed in shadows.* The weight of it pressed down on him, a force that seemed to curl around his thoughts, twisting them, shaping them.

Footsteps sounded nearby, soft and measured, pulling him back to the present. Sari’s figure emerged from the darkness, her face half-lit by the flickering light of her lantern. Her gaze was steady, a mixture of concern and something darker, something that mirrored his own uncertainty. She had seen him like this before, after other visions, but there was a distance in her expression now, as though she were observing him from behind a veil.

“Talon.” Her voice was low, edged with a calm that seemed almost unnatural. She stepped closer, her eyes flickering to the medallion resting against his chest. “You saw something.”

He nodded, the weight of the vision settling into his bones. “Metis,” he whispered, the name lingering in the air like a curse. “I saw… ruins, desolation. It felt like—” he hesitated, searching for the words, “—like something was being revealed, something terrible, as if all of it is tied to this.” His hand tightened around the medallion.

Sari’s gaze remained fixed on him, her expression unreadable. For a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of recognition, a shadow of understanding that she quickly masked. “The visions are growing stronger,” she said, her voice neutral, but there was an edge to it, a tension beneath the surface. “Whatever it is that’s calling to you, it won’t stop until it’s finished.”

Talon swallowed, his throat dry. “Finished?” The word felt heavy, final, as though it carried the weight of every ruin he had seen, every fragment of the prophecy that echoed in his mind.

Sari didn’t answer immediately. Her gaze drifted past him, into the shadows, as though she were looking for something beyond the reach of the light. When she finally spoke, her voice was soft, almost as if she were speaking to herself. “The ruin knows you,” she murmured, echoing the words from his vision. Her eyes met his, sharp and probing. “Do you know what that means?”

The question struck him like a blow, tearing open a hollow space inside him that he hadn’t realized was there. Did he know? Or had he simply been following, drawn by the medallion’s pull, by a sense of duty that he didn’t fully understand? He shook his head, unable to answer, but the question lingered, a wound that refused to close.

Sari’s gaze softened, but there was a flicker of something else in her eyes—a glint of fear, or perhaps resignation. “Sometimes, Talon,” she said quietly, “knowing isn’t a comfort. Sometimes, it’s a burden.”

The silence stretched between them, thick and heavy, filled with unspoken fears and questions. Talon felt the weight of her words settle into him, mingling with the remnants of the vision, and he realized with a chilling clarity that he wasn’t ready for the answers. Not yet.

A shift in the shadows caught his eye, a flicker at the edge of his vision. He glanced over his shoulder, but there was nothing there—only the darkness, dense and impenetrable. And yet, the sensation lingered, a sense of being watched, of something lurking just beyond sight.

“Sari…” he began, his voice trailing off as he searched for the words. “Do you… ever feel like there’s something else? Watching us?”

Sari’s expression hardened, her eyes narrowing as though she, too, sensed something. “The forest is full of secrets,” she replied, her tone cautious. “It’s been here long before us, and it’ll remain long after. Places like this… they remember.”

The phrase struck a chord, sending a shiver down his spine. *They remember.* The thought was unsettling, as though the forest itself was alive, an ancient witness to forgotten horrors, biding its time. He felt the medallion pulse in response, a cold, insistent reminder that he was bound to this place, to this prophecy.

Sari turned away, casting her gaze into the depths of the forest. “Come on. The others are waiting. We shouldn’t stay here too long.” She started walking, her steps soft, but each one seemed to echo, reverberating through the stillness.

Talon followed, the darkness pressing close around them. With every step, he felt the weight of the medallion grow heavier, its pull deepening, drawing him forward. And as he walked, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the forest itself was watching, that the shadows held memories of things best left forgotten.

In the distance, faint shapes flickered in the fog, almost human but twisted, distorted—silent witnesses to the path he’d chosen.

As Talon followed Sari deeper into the forest, the shadows thickened, a cloak of darkness settling over the trees, casting everything into a muted twilight. The air felt thicker, saturated with the earthy scent of damp leaves and decay. Each breath tasted of rot, of something ancient stirring beneath the surface, filling his lungs with a heaviness that felt almost oppressive. 

Sari’s silhouette moved ahead of him, her form softened by the fog, her lantern casting a weak, ghostly glow that seemed to barely cut through the darkness. Talon’s steps fell in rhythm with hers, but every sound felt dampened, muffled, as if they were treading in sacred, forbidden ground. The medallion’s weight was a constant presence against his chest, a reminder of the prophecy, of the vision that had clawed its way into his mind.

The fog shifted around them, curling like fingers, wrapping around the trees and stretching across their path. Strange shapes flickered at the edge of his vision, just outside the reach of Sari’s lantern—a flash of bone-white branches, twisted like skeletal limbs, or the glint of something sharp and metallic hidden beneath layers of moss. But each time he looked directly, the shapes dissolved, melting back into the fog as if they had never been there.

“Sari,” he called softly, his voice barely more than a whisper, as if afraid to disturb whatever presence lingered here. “This place… it doesn’t feel right.”

She paused, her gaze turning toward him, her face half-hidden in shadow. “Places like this rarely do,” she replied, her tone measured but heavy, as though she, too, felt the weight pressing down on them. “The forest… it has its own memory. It keeps things we’d rather forget.”

Talon felt a chill snake down his spine, colder than the night air. “You think it’s… aware?”

Sari’s eyes met his, sharp and searching. “I think it’s older than we know. And things that old… they don’t forget easily.” She looked away, her gaze sweeping the shadows. “Stay close. The fog has a way of distorting paths, especially at night.”

They moved on in silence, the fog seeming to thicken with each step, until the trees themselves became little more than vague shapes looming on either side. Talon’s hand brushed against one of them, and he recoiled, feeling a texture that wasn’t bark but something cold and almost… metallic.

He hesitated, glancing back at the tree. For a moment, he could have sworn the surface was laced with thin, metallic lines, a faint silver webbing that glinted in the dim light. But when he blinked, it was gone, replaced by rough bark and knotted roots.

*Hallucinations.* Or something worse. He pressed his hand to his chest, feeling the familiar, icy weight of the medallion. The visions from before lingered at the edges of his mind, fragments of twisted landscapes and endless ruin, as if they had left scars on his consciousness that refused to fade.

Sari’s voice cut through his thoughts. “Up ahead. Do you see that?”

He looked past her, squinting into the fog. At first, he saw nothing but shadows, but then, slowly, a shape began to emerge—a clearing, dimly lit, where the fog seemed to thin just enough to reveal what lay beyond. It was a circle of standing stones, tall and uneven, jutting from the earth like jagged teeth.

The stones were ancient, covered in thick moss and streaked with black stains that could have been age or something darker. Symbols covered their surfaces, strange, twisting marks that seemed to writhe as he looked at them, shifting and reforming into shapes that felt both familiar and completely alien.

Sari approached one of the stones, her gaze intent, her fingers brushing over the symbols. “These… they’re similar to the ones in the cabin,” she murmured, almost to herself. “Older, though. Far older.”

Talon’s heart pounded, his gaze drawn to the symbols despite himself. As he stared, the lines seemed to pulse, the shapes bending and twisting into forms that clawed at the edges of his memory, echoes from the vision—the skeletal figures, the shattered landscapes, the monolithic throne of Metis.

“What do they mean?” he asked, his voice low, almost reverent.

Sari shook her head slowly, her fingers tracing the symbols with a kind of hesitant reverence. “I don’t know. But these markings… they carry something dark. A memory of power, of ruin.” Her eyes met his, her expression grave. “This place is a wound, Talon. A scar left behind by something… unnatural.”

The medallion throbbed against his chest, its pulse matching the rhythm of his heartbeat, drawing his gaze to one of the stones at the edge of the circle. There, half-hidden by moss and shadows, he saw a symbol that was different from the others—more intricate, almost like a spiral, with lines that branched out in delicate, fractal patterns.

As he stared, the lines seemed to shift, forming words, shapes, images—a memory, old and buried, surfacing in his mind. He could see flames, high and consuming, reaching toward a blackened sky. Figures danced in the shadows, chanting words he couldn’t understand, their faces hidden, their movements unnatural, fevered. And above them, the image of a twisted, dark throne, a figure of shadow and eyes that held nothing but hunger.

He staggered back, gasping as the vision dissolved, leaving him cold and trembling. Sari caught his arm, steadying him, her gaze intent. “What did you see?”

Talon shook his head, struggling to find his voice. “A throne… darkness… Metis.” The name felt heavy in his mouth, as if merely saying it gave weight to the horror he had seen.

Sari’s expression hardened, a flicker of fear passing over her face before she masked it. “Metis,” she repeated softly, almost as if testing the name on her tongue. “It seems the forest knows more than we do.”

They both turned back to the stones, the clearing silent and still, as if holding its breath. The fog pressed close around them, thickening at the edges of the clearing, forming a barrier that felt almost alive. Talon reached for the medallion, the cold of it grounding him, a tether to keep him from slipping back into the darkness that lingered at the edge of his vision.

Sari let her hand fall from the stone, her gaze shifting back to the path they had come from. “We should leave. Whatever this place is, it isn’t meant for us.” Her voice was firm, but there was a softness in her eyes, a hint of understanding that she kept hidden from Griffin, from everyone but him.

Talon nodded, forcing his feet to move, though his gaze lingered on the symbols, the strange, twisted forms that seemed to call to him, whispering of forgotten knowledge, of a power that lay just beyond his reach.

As they turned to leave, a faint, almost imperceptible sound reached his ears—a low hum, barely audible, resonating from the stones, as though they were alive, holding onto a memory that refused to die.

They moved quickly, leaving the clearing behind, but the weight of it remained, heavy in the air, pressing down on them with each step. The forest seemed darker now, the fog denser, more suffocating, as though it had drawn something from the clearing, from the stones, and was now guarding it, hiding it within its depths.

And as they walked, Talon could feel it—the medallion’s pulse, more insistent now, a cold, relentless rhythm that echoed through his bones, pulling him forward, deeper into the forest, deeper into the shadows.

In the silence, the prophecy returned, a whisper in his mind.

*Bound by ancient ruin, a fate sealed in shadows.*
