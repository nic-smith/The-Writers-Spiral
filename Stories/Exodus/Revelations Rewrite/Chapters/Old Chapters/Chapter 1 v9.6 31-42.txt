[P31]
Talon was about to respond when he saw it—a dark shape looming in the distance, obscured by twisted branches and thick undergrowth. His heart quickened, the doubts and weariness momentarily forgotten. “There!” he said, pointing ahead. Without waiting, he picked up his pace, leaving Griffin and Sari scrambling to keep up.

[P32]
As Talon moved closer, the shape began to take form—a rundown cabin, half-concealed by the forest. Its weathered walls leaned under the weight of creeping vines, the roof sagging as though burdened by years of isolation. The sight of it, incongruous amidst the endless stretch of trees, sent a rush of adrenaline through him. Relief, tempered by trepidation, washed over him. They had finally found something.

[P33]
Sari caught up, her eyes widening with a mixture of relief and wariness. “Is that…?” she began, her voice barely a whisper, as if speaking louder might make the vision vanish. The cabin stood silent, as if waiting for them, its darkened windows like empty eyes watching their approach.

[P34]
Griffin’s reaction was more guarded. He moved cautiously, his gaze sweeping over the surrounding area before focusing on the cabin itself. “It could be a trap,” he muttered, suspicion hardening his features. His hand drifted to the knife at his belt, fingers tightening around the hilt.

[P35]
But Talon felt something different. As he stared at the cabin, he sensed a strange familiarity, as if he had been here before, though he knew that was impossible. The medallion at his chest seemed to pulse, a steady beat that matched his racing heart. This place held something for them—something hidden, something waiting.

[P36]
They stepped closer, each of them feeling the weight of the forest lift slightly, as though the cabin were offering a reprieve from the endless stretch of trees. The air around it felt still, heavy with an unsettling calm that made Talon’s skin prickle. The sense of being watched was stronger here, more direct, as if unseen eyes were observing them from within the cabin’s walls.

[P37]
Griffin glanced back at Talon, skepticism warring with the faintest glimmer of hope. “So, what now? Is this where the medallion led us?” The bitterness in his voice was softened by the exhaustion that lined his face, as though even his frustration had grown weary.

[P38]
Talon nodded slowly, feeling the medallion’s pull even stronger now, urging him forward. He could see the strain in his friends’ faces, the doubt and fear mixed with exhaustion. “I don’t know what’s in there,” he admitted, his voice quiet but resolute. “But we didn’t come this far to turn back now.”

[P39]
Sari’s hand was on her blade, her stance steady as she looked toward the cabin with a mix of caution and determination. “Let’s go in carefully. If this is what we came for, we need to be ready for anything.” Her gaze flicked between Talon and Griffin, her confidence an anchor amidst the tension that hung between them.

[P40]
They reached the cabin’s entrance, a narrow door barely hanging on its rusted hinges. Talon hesitated, his hand hovering over the handle, feeling the medallion’s pulse thrumming through his fingers. The air here felt different, charged with something unexplainable, a presence that was both inviting and foreboding. His heart pounded as he pushed the door open, its groan echoing into the quiet.

[P41]
The interior was dark, a thick, musty scent wrapping around them as they stepped inside. Dust motes floated in the slanting light that filtered through the cracks in the walls, drifting lazily through the air like tiny specters. Talon’s eyes adjusted slowly, picking out the shapes of broken furniture, a table half-collapsed in the corner, a bookshelf leaning dangerously to one side.

[P42]
As they stood in the threshold, an overwhelming sense of both familiarity and unease settled over them. It was as if the cabin itself held memories, whispering secrets that danced just beyond their grasp. Talon felt the medallion’s pull intensify, guiding him further into the shadows, and he knew that whatever lay hidden here was tied to the journey they had undertaken—a revelation waiting to be unearthed, a mystery on the brink of unveiling itself.
