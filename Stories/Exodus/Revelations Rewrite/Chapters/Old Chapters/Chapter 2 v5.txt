Chapter 2

---

The forest was darker than it should have been for midday, the canopy above so dense that it blocked out much of the sunlight, casting everything in a dim, greenish gloom. Dampness hung thick in the air, mingling with the scent of decaying leaves and wet earth, and each of their footsteps seemed to sink into the mossy ground as if the forest were swallowing them whole. Every rustling leaf and snapping twig echoed around them, a reminder of how isolated—and how vulnerable—they were.

Griffin took the lead again, his hand steady on the hilt of his sword, his gaze sharp as it scanned the shadows ahead. His movements were careful but purposeful, his stance betraying a quiet but constant tension. Talon trailed a few steps behind, feeling the weight of Dominic’s journal heavy in his pack and the familiar, cold pulse of the medallion against his chest. Despite his attempt to shake off the cabin’s lingering effect, Dominic’s words echoed in his mind like a warning, a whispered reminder of the costs yet to come.

Sari walked between them, her movements graceful yet weary, her expression one of quiet focus that masked the exhaustion etched in her face. She had barely spoken since they’d left the cabin, her eyes darting between the shadows, as if expecting to see the remnants of Dominic’s warnings flickering through the trees.

“Something doesn’t feel right,” she murmured, breaking the silence. She slowed her pace, scanning their surroundings with a wary gaze. “The forest… it’s too quiet.”

Griffin gave a short nod, his face grim. “Feels like we’re being watched.” His hand tightened around his sword, and his gaze slid briefly to Talon, a silent accusation behind his words. Talon felt the weight of Griffin’s suspicion settle over him, as though the medallion itself were to blame for the unease lingering in the air.

Talon fought the urge to reach for it, resisting its pull even as it pulsed coldly against his chest. He forced himself to focus instead on the sounds around them, keeping his senses alert, trying to ignore the faint thrumming of the medallion that seemed to match the tension thrumming in his own veins.

A faint rustling broke the silence, and they froze, each of them turning instinctively toward the sound. The rustling grew louder, creeping through the underbrush with a steady, rhythmic movement, like something large stalking just beyond the edge of sight. Talon’s heart quickened, a chill prickling up the back of his neck.

Griffin held up a hand, signaling for silence, his expression hardening. His eyes scanned the dense foliage, narrowing as the seconds stretched, the quiet thickening around them until every breath felt amplified. Then, from deeper within the trees, a low, haunting sound reached them—a deep, rumbling purr that seemed to vibrate through the air, carrying an unnatural, bone-chilling resonance.

The sound grew louder, circling them like a ghostly echo, and Talon’s heart hammered against his ribs, every instinct telling him to run. Beside him, Sari took a step back, her hand hovering near the dagger at her side, her eyes wide with apprehension. “What… what is that?”

Griffin’s face tightened, his voice barely more than a whisper. “Eidolons.”

Talon felt a jolt of fear, his blood turning cold. He had heard stories about these creatures—shadowy figures that moved like ghosts through the forest, beings of darkness more felt than seen. No one knew what they truly were, but legends described them as creatures born of the dark, as much a part of the forest as the trees themselves. He glanced at Sari, and her fear mirrored his own.

The rumbling purr shifted, evolving into a clicking sound that echoed from all sides, bouncing off the trees and disorienting them. Talon gripped his weapon tightly, his gaze scanning the shadows, straining to catch a glimpse of movement. His mind raced, trying to recall anything that could help them survive an encounter with these things.

Without warning, a shadow darted between the trees—a sleek, dark figure that moved with unnatural speed. Talon barely caught a glimpse of it—a flash of skeletal limbs bent at impossible angles, each movement disturbingly smooth. Another figure followed, and then another, their shapes shifting in and out of the darkness, blending seamlessly with the forest.

Griffin raised his sword, his stance tense and ready. “Stay close,” he whispered, his voice sharp and urgent. “They hunt in packs. Don’t let them separate us.”

Sari moved closer, her hand finding Talon’s arm, her grip firm, steadying him as they pressed together in a defensive circle. The medallion pulsed harder, its beat cold and insistent against Talon’s chest, as if feeding off his fear, urging him to tap into its power.

The forest seemed to hold its breath, a heavy silence settling over them, broken only by the eerie clicking that filled the air. And then, like shadows come to life, the Eidolons attacked.

The Eidolons pressed in, their shadowed forms darting in and out of sight, each movement calculated, a taunting reminder of the creatures’ dark intelligence. Talon’s breath came fast, each one a harsh rasp as he fought to keep his focus. His gaze tracked the flickers of movement, but the shadows shifted constantly, each Eidolon melding with the darkness before he could fully lock onto them. The clicking sounds reverberated through the trees, a disorienting rhythm that kept them off balance, heightening the sense of dread building in the air.

Griffin was a flurry of precision and control, his sword slicing through the air, each swing a deadly arc that kept the creatures at bay. Talon caught a glimpse of him shifting his stance, keeping his body between Sari and the Eidolons, his movements protective, every action carrying a silent message: he would defend her, even if it meant sacrificing himself.

The medallion pulsed stronger now, an insistent rhythm that seemed to echo Talon’s heartbeat, urging him to draw on its power. He clenched his jaw, fighting the urge, his mind caught in a battle between fear and desperation. Sari’s earlier words echoed in his head: *“Don’t let it control you.”* But each time he glanced around and saw the creatures creeping closer, every instinct screamed to release the medallion’s power, to let it consume the threat that surrounded them.

Beside him, Sari’s breaths were shallow, controlled, but he could feel the tension radiating from her. Her dagger flashed briefly in the low light as she swiped at a creature that lunged too close, driving it back with a practiced movement. She caught Talon’s gaze, her expression a blend of pain and resolve, a silent plea to stay grounded—to resist the pull of the medallion no matter how desperate the situation became.

But then an Eidolon broke through their defenses, darting forward with bone-chilling speed. Talon moved on instinct, his hand tightening around his weapon as he stepped forward, feeling a surge of power radiate from the medallion, sharpening his senses and quickening his reflexes. His blade struck the creature, sending it reeling back, a guttural hiss escaping its skeletal mouth.

The taste of power flooded his senses, filling him with a cold, intoxicating energy that surged through his veins. For a fleeting moment, everything became clearer, sharper—the shadows parted, revealing the creatures in stark detail, their forms etched in shades of dark and light. But as he clung to that clarity, he felt the power slipping, slipping too quickly for him to control. It spiraled out, wild and untamed, a force that surged beyond his reach, lashing out in all directions.

A shockwave erupted, the dark energy ripping outward and throwing him backward. The ground rushed up to meet him, and he felt the jarring impact through every bone. Then he heard a sharp cry—Sari’s voice, filled with pain—and his heart dropped. He turned, dread filling his chest, to see her clutching her shoulder, blood seeping between her fingers.

Griffin’s gaze snapped to Talon, fury blazing in his eyes. “What did you do?” His voice was harsh, raw with accusation. The distrust Talon had felt before now lay bare, a visceral, cutting fury.

“I… I didn’t mean to,” Talon stammered, his voice thick with guilt. The medallion pulsed coldly against his chest, its weight a reminder of the power he had failed to control. He reached out, wanting to move toward Sari, but another Eidolon lunged, blocking his path.

Griffin’s expression shifted, his anger replaced by a fierce protectiveness as he turned back to the creatures. “Stay close to me, Sari,” he said, his voice cold and unyielding. He placed himself firmly between her and Talon, every movement purposeful, his message clear: he would shield her, even if it meant standing against Talon.

The Eidolons pressed forward again, their forms melding with the darkness, relentless and unyielding. Talon’s muscles tightened, shame twisting inside him, but he forced himself to focus, to resist the medallion’s pull, even as it throbbed with a dark energy, calling to him, beckoning him to tap into its depths once more.

Sari’s voice, though pained, broke through the chaos. “Talon… don’t let it control you.” Her eyes met his, steady despite the injury, her faith in him unwavering. That simple look held him together, a reminder of the man he wanted to be, not the vessel the medallion would make of him.

He took a breath, steadying himself, feeling the grip of the medallion’s pull loosen, if only slightly. He adjusted his stance, shifting his focus back to the Eidolons as they advanced, their skeletal forms gliding through the shadows with an eerie, predatory grace.

The clicking sounds grew louder, more insistent, and Talon braced himself, determined to face them on his terms, without surrendering to the medallion’s lure. But in the back of his mind, the memory of the unleashed power lingered, a cold thrill that twisted through his thoughts—a promise of strength and control he didn’t fully understand, but one he knew could destroy him if he wasn’t careful.

Griffin fought beside him, his movements disciplined and unyielding, his expression a mix of fury and focus as he protected Sari, striking down each creature that drew too close. Talon noticed the subtle shift in Griffin’s stance, the way he positioned himself with an almost unconscious protectiveness, his focus unwavering, his loyalty to Sari clear in every movement.

Finally, the creatures seemed to hesitate, as if sensing the group’s determination. The Eidolons held back, their eyes gleaming coldly as they circled, watching with a patient, calculating gaze, waiting for the perfect moment to strike once more.

The Eidolons grew bolder, their skeletal forms blending seamlessly into the darkness, their low purrs transforming into guttural clicks that echoed through the trees. They moved with a predatory confidence, their limbs bending at unnatural angles as they circled closer, testing the group’s defenses. Talon could feel cold sweat trickling down his brow, the adrenaline burning through his exhaustion, keeping him sharp even as his mind spun with Sari’s words—*don’t let it control you.*

But the medallion throbbed against his chest, insistent, an unyielding reminder of the dark power waiting to be unleashed.

Griffin’s focus was razor-sharp, his face set with grim determination as he swung his sword in calculated arcs, each movement precise, intercepting every advance with brutal efficiency. Talon watched as Griffin positioned himself protectively in front of Sari, his stance solid, his expression fierce. Griffin’s eyes flickered over to Talon only once, carrying a silent, unspoken warning: there would be no second chances.

One of the Eidolons lunged, breaking from the shadows with terrifying speed, its jaws wide in a silent snarl, skeletal limbs outstretched. Talon sidestepped just in time, thrusting his blade outward and feeling a satisfying impact as the creature hissed, retreating with a malevolent gleam in its eyes. But for every Eidolon that faltered, two more took its place, their relentless persistence a silent reminder of their intent—to wear them down, to outlast them.

Sari pushed herself upright, though her injury slowed her, her face pale with pain. She threw a determined look at Griffin, her gaze clear despite the exhaustion. “We need to break free,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, but every word resolute. “Staying here… it’s only drawing them closer.”

Griffin nodded, his attention never leaving the creatures. “We push forward, no matter what,” he said, his tone steel-edged, unyielding. His gaze landed on Talon, and his expression hardened. “No more mistakes.”

The words stung, as intended—a pointed reminder of the earlier misstep, a warning that Talon knew he couldn’t afford to ignore. He took a steadying breath, forcing the shame and anger down, focusing on the immediate threat, the creatures circling them like wolves closing in on wounded prey.

They moved together, pressing forward, with Sari leaning lightly on Griffin for support. Talon took up the rear, his senses heightened, every nerve on edge as he watched for any sign of movement from the creatures. The Eidolons seemed to pull back slightly, their eyes gleaming with a cold intelligence as they tracked the group’s every step. Their low hum and clicks filled the air, a sinister melody that was both haunting and maddeningly hypnotic.

Then, as if responding to a silent command, the Eidolons lunged again, moving in unison—a dark wave of shadow and teeth, their movements fluid, deadly. Talon reacted instinctively, his body moving with a speed he hadn’t known he possessed, his blade striking out in a wide arc. The medallion’s influence sharpened his reflexes, guiding his movements, but he held back from fully surrendering to its pull, keeping his grip tight, his focus steady.

Griffin fought beside him, his sword flashing in the dim light, his expression grim but focused, every strike delivered with unflinching precision. Talon noticed the way Griffin angled himself slightly, a subtle maneuver to keep himself between Sari and the creatures, his protectiveness clear even amidst the chaos.

After what felt like an eternity, a lull fell over the clearing. The Eidolons retreated a few paces, their eyes glinting with a dark intelligence, watching the group with a calculating gaze. They seemed to assess the trio, their hunger tempered by a strange patience, as though weighing whether this battle was worth their effort.

For a tense moment, no one moved. Talon’s chest heaved, his grip loosening on his weapon as he let out a shaky breath, relief washing over him but mingling with the hollow ache of guilt. Sari’s injury, Griffin’s distrust, the dark pull of the medallion—all weighed on him, settling like a stone in his chest. The silence in the clearing was nearly as oppressive as the battle had been, the air thick with everything left unsaid.

Sari broke the silence, her voice soft but steady. “We… need to keep moving. They’ll be back.” She glanced at Griffin, her expression lined with gratitude and pain. Then her gaze shifted to Talon, unreadable but tinged with a quiet determination. “We can’t let them surround us again.”

Griffin gave a curt nod, his gaze lingering on Talon with a look that bordered on accusation. “Let’s hope there aren’t more surprises waiting,” he muttered, his voice clipped. “We’re barely holding together as it is.”

They resumed their march, each step heavy with exhaustion, but fueled by the knowledge that there was no safety in these woods. Talon kept his gaze fixed on the path ahead, though he could feel Griffin’s mistrust like a tangible weight between them. The medallion’s pulse had slowed, its cold throb a distant beat, but he knew it was only lying in wait, its pull as inescapable as the darkness that surrounded them.

As they moved deeper into the forest, Talon felt a gnawing dread take root, an unshakeable certainty that this encounter had only scratched the surface of the darkness lying ahead—and that the greatest danger wasn’t lurking in the forest, but hanging around his own neck, waiting patiently for the next moment of weakness.
