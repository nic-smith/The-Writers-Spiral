Chapter 1: Into the Unknown

#### **[P1]**
As the trio pushed deeper into the forest, the trees loomed over them like ancient sentinels, their gnarled branches intertwining to form a dense, oppressive canopy. The air thickened with the musty scent of damp soil and decaying foliage, pressing down on them like an oppressive weight. Talon felt the forest constrict around him, the shadows flickering and whispering secrets that danced just beyond his grasp, stirring a sense of foreboding in his gut.

Talon could hear Griffin’s frustrated breaths behind him, every exhale sharp with irritation. If Sari and Talon couldn't hear the darkness in his tone, they could feel it through every slash of his sword against the underbrush that stood defiantly in his path.

#### **[P3]**
Sari remained silent, her expression set and focused, flicking her gaze between the undergrowth and Talon’s back. She held one blade at her side and the other in her right hand, using them to cut through patches of thick grass and tangled vines that blocked their path.

“We’ve been wandering for hours," Griffin barked with conviction. “Your medallion isn’t leading us anywhere but around in circles!” His eyes darted nervously between the trees, doubt creeping into his tone as the oppressive forest seemed to close in around them. This, their second day of trudging through the underbrush, had frayed their nerves and brought their anxiety to a boiling point, the heat and humidity making their breaths labored as they tried to suck in the thick air around them.

Talon clenched the medallion in his pocket, feeling its cool surface against his palm. He opened his mouth to try to explain what he really didn't understand himself, but his breath hitched at the first word, making only a small shuddered sound.

#### **[P6]**
"What!?!" Griffin spat in frustration at Talon's timidness.

#### **[P7]**
“It’s supposed to guide us,” Talon replied with no conviction in his tone as uncertainty gnawed at his resolve. The force propelling him forward was something he couldn’t fully articulate. The power he felt in the medallion was wholly new to him. The memories of his father’s stories about the heirloom echoed in his mind—the tales of its power and how it could reveal hidden truths. Until recently, they were just stories. He had scarcely worn it until his dad's funeral, but on that day, the medallion had come to life in his mind and soul. Now, it felt more like a burden than a blessing—a call he couldn't ignore.

“Maybe we should take a break and regroup,” Sari suggested, glancing at her dwindling water supply. “We need to find water soon, or we will have bigger problems. I only packed enough for two days, but we’ve been lost for nearly four. If we don’t find something soon…” Her voice trailed off, the unspoken worry heavy in the air.

#### **[P9]**
Talon didn’t turn around. His grip tightened on the medallion hanging from his neck, fingers tracing the familiar grooves as if seeking reassurance. The pull at his soul was strong, a steady pulse that felt like it was guiding him through the darkness. But he knew how it must look to Griffin—stumbling blindly through the forest, chasing shadows.

#### **[P10]**
“It’s this way,” he said quietly, the certainty in his voice betraying the uncertainty he felt inside. He didn't mean to ignore Sari's suggestion, but he couldn't bear to sit and watch Griffin stew.
