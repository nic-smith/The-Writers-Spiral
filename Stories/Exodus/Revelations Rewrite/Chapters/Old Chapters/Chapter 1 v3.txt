Chapter 1:

---

The forest stretched ahead like an endless maze, shadows clinging thickly to every tree and thicket as the group pressed forward. They had left the small clearing of their camp at dawn, setting out with a sense of quiet urgency, though the forest seemed to resist their progress at every step. Branches caught on their clothes, scraping skin and snagging packs, as though the woods themselves were alive with a silent intent to hinder them.

Griffin led the way, his sword occasionally flashing as he cut through stubborn underbrush. Each swing was firm, measured, his expression one of determination laced with something darker. Talon noticed the way Griffin’s eyes flicked back to him now and then, a subtle tension growing with every glance. Behind him, Sari moved with a quieter grace, her presence an anchor that kept the uneasy silence from slipping into outright discord.

But Talon could feel the weight of Griffin’s skepticism growing, like a low hum building beneath the surface of their silent trek. He gritted his teeth, feeling the familiar pull of the medallion against his chest. It was a subtle throb, a silent reminder of the power he carried, though he kept his hand away from it. The memory of last night’s vision still clung to him, a dark afterimage that made him wary of the medallion’s pull.

Branches snapped and brambles tugged at his clothes, forcing him to stumble now and then. Each time he hesitated, he could sense Griffin’s impatience intensifying, the unspoken tension crackling between them.

Finally, Griffin paused and turned, his gaze sharp, cutting through the morning fog that hovered just above the ground. “Are you going to keep that thing on you every second?” he asked, voice low but edged. There was no need to name the medallion; the weight of it hung between them, unspoken yet undeniable.

Talon’s jaw tightened. “It’s not like I have a choice,” he replied evenly, though his hand itched to reach for it, to feel its solid reassurance against his palm. “It’s as much a part of this journey as anything else.”

Griffin’s expression didn’t soften. “Just remember that a tool is only useful if it doesn’t start using you.” He turned back without waiting for a response, resuming his steady march forward.

Sari gave Talon a quiet, understanding look, one that seemed to say she saw more than she let on. She fell in beside him, her voice a soft murmur. “He’s just looking out for us. For you, too.”

Talon managed a small nod, though the weight of Griffin’s distrust settled heavily on his shoulders. The forest grew thicker, more tangled, as if reflecting the tension simmering among them. A tangle of roots forced them to move single file, Sari slipping behind him, her presence reassuring yet faint in the dense, darkening trees.

A new sound drifted through the air, so subtle it could have been imagined—the faint rustle of leaves, a barely perceptible hum that sent a chill through Talon’s spine. He slowed, casting a wary glance into the depths of the forest. There was nothing there, just shifting shadows and the flicker of movement too quick to catch.

But the unease grew, settling over them like a shadow that couldn’t be shaken.

They pressed on, the thickening trees casting deeper shadows as the morning light struggled to break through the canopy. Every few steps, Griffin hacked at the underbrush, his movements sharper, more forceful, his frustration bleeding into each swing. Talon’s gaze drifted from Griffin’s tense figure to the forest around them, an oppressive weight pressing in, as if the trees were listening, watching.

The path twisted unexpectedly, and just as they rounded a dense thicket, they found themselves at the edge of a small clearing. In the center, half-hidden by vines and rotting foliage, stood a dilapidated cabin, its walls slanted with age, its roof barely holding together. The place exuded an unsettling stillness, the kind that hinted at secrets best left undisturbed.

They stopped in unison, each of them taking in the sight. Sari shifted uncomfortably, her gaze scanning the structure as if it might reveal something beneath the decay. Griffin’s eyes narrowed, and without a word, he stepped forward, gesturing for them to stay back.

“Stay here,” he murmured, his tone edged with caution. “Let me check it first.”

Talon watched him approach the cabin with a mixture of curiosity and unease. There was a strange familiarity to the place, something that tugged at the edges of his mind, a whisper of recognition he couldn’t quite place. The medallion felt heavier against his chest, as if responding to the unease in the air.

Griffin pushed the door open with his foot, his sword raised as he stepped inside. The door creaked and groaned, and for a brief moment, all Talon could hear was the faint rustle of the wind through the trees. Then Griffin disappeared into the shadowy interior, leaving Talon and Sari standing alone at the edge of the clearing.

Sari glanced over at him, her brow furrowed. “Do you feel it too?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Talon nodded, though he couldn’t put words to what he was feeling. “It’s like... like something’s waiting in there,” he said, his eyes still on the cabin. “Or like it’s been here long enough to remember.”

They waited in tense silence until Griffin reappeared in the doorway, his face grim but motioning them forward. “It’s clear. But... strange.” He stepped aside to let them enter, his eyes lingering on Talon’s medallion with a look that bordered on suspicion.

Inside, the cabin was a jumble of rotting furniture and debris, the remnants of another life scattered across the floor. Dust hung thick in the air, illuminated by weak beams of light filtering through gaps in the walls. Broken jars lined a shelf near the back, their contents long dried and cracked. A small, rusted axe lay near the doorway, embedded in the splintered remains of what once might have been a table.

Sari picked her way through the clutter, her fingers brushing lightly over an overturned chair, as if sensing the ghosts of those who had once sought shelter here. Talon moved toward a corner, his eyes catching on a stack of papers yellowed with age. As he bent down, he noticed something hidden beneath them—an old, leather-bound book with pages worn from use.

Griffin moved in close, his gaze following Talon’s as he picked up the book. The leather cover was scarred, the initials **D.H.** scratched faintly into its surface. Talon’s fingers brushed the worn leather, and a strange feeling of déjà vu washed over him, as if he were holding a piece of something far greater than himself.

“A journal?” Sari asked, her voice breaking the heavy silence.

Talon nodded, glancing up at her and Griffin. “Looks like it. Someone left this here—maybe they stayed here for a while. Or maybe they didn’t make it out.”

Griffin’s expression darkened, and he leaned in, peering over Talon’s shoulder. “Open it,” he said, his voice barely more than a whisper, but it held a tension Talon couldn’t ignore.

Slowly, Talon opened the cover, the pages crackling under his fingertips as he flipped to the first entry. The handwriting was rough and uneven, as though written by someone in haste or desperation. He read aloud, his voice low:

“I thought I could escape it. But there is no escaping something that follows you from within. The Veil is as much a part of me as my own shadow, and in these woods, I’ve come to know its darkness. I have betrayed once and been betrayed in turn, but the cost of wielding its power is far greater than I could have imagined.”

Talon glanced up, the words echoing in his mind with a strange familiarity. The unease in his chest grew, a sensation that seemed to resonate with the medallion’s steady, chilling pulse.

The silence in the cabin deepened as Talon’s voice faded, the words from the journal lingering in the stale air. Griffin’s face remained unreadable, though his jaw clenched as he listened, and Sari’s gaze flickered with something between curiosity and worry. Talon could feel the weight of their attention pressing on him, and for a moment, he wondered if he should continue. But there was an undeniable pull in those words, as if they’d been waiting for him specifically to discover them.

He turned to another entry, further along in the journal. The ink was smeared in places, the handwriting more frantic, as though the writer’s grip had faltered.

“I tried to control it, tried to make it bend to my will, but the Veil has its own mind. It twists thoughts, bends them into shadows of their former selves. I used to believe I was stronger than it, but now… I am not so sure. The others began to see it, I think—the way it changed me. And in the end, they were right to take it away.”

Talon paused, feeling a chill creep up his spine. The medallion seemed heavier than before, its presence pressing into his chest like a warning, or maybe a promise. He looked at Griffin, whose eyes had narrowed, a dark understanding flickering in them.

“This… this could be Dominic’s,” Talon said, more to himself than anyone else. The initials **D.H.** felt significant, though he couldn’t yet place why.

Griffin leaned closer, his voice low and laced with a skepticism that bordered on accusation. “And if it is, what does that mean? Another warning that you’ll just ignore?” The question hung in the air, pointed and sharp, and Talon felt his pulse quicken.

“It’s not like that,” Talon replied, a hint of defensiveness creeping into his tone. “The medallion... it’s different. It chose me. I didn’t take it by force.”

“Maybe,” Griffin said, his voice cold. “Or maybe you’re just telling yourself that to feel better about it.” His gaze was steely, and for a moment, the tension between them felt thick enough to cut.

Sari placed a gentle hand on Griffin’s arm, grounding him, though her own expression was troubled. “We don’t know the full story yet,” she said softly, her voice calm but firm. “Let’s read more. Maybe there’s something here that can help us understand.”

Reluctantly, Griffin nodded, and Talon turned back to the journal, scanning through pages of scattered notes, thoughts, and reflections until another entry caught his eye.

“There are days when I wonder if it’s worth it, carrying this burden alone. I thought I was strong enough, thought that I could handle it. But now, alone in these woods, I’m starting to see things—hear things. Maybe it’s the Veil’s way of breaking me down, showing me my limits. If anyone ever finds this… if you’re reading these words… remember that not all power is worth the price.”

A chill settled over the group, each word resonating with a haunting clarity. Talon closed the journal gently, his mind racing with the possibilities, the warnings. He felt a strange mix of fascination and dread—Dominic’s words seemed almost prophetic, speaking to fears Talon hadn’t yet voiced but had started to feel deep down.

Griffin’s expression had shifted, his usual guarded look deepening into something darker, more wary. “This… this journal,” he muttered, “it’s nothing but a cautionary tale. And maybe one we should heed, before it’s too late.”

Talon met Griffin’s gaze, his voice quieter but laced with conviction. “It’s easy to look at the worst-case scenario, Griffin. But if we don’t understand the Veil’s power, if we don’t at least try, then we’ll never know what we’re up against. Or how to defeat it.”

Griffin let out a frustrated breath, turning away. “Just remember, you’re not the only one who pays the price for this, Talon.” His words were weighted with unspoken tension, each syllable a quiet accusation. “We’re all in this together, for better or worse.”

The silence thickened as they absorbed the meaning behind his words. Sari stepped between them, her calm gaze flicking from one to the other, a quiet authority in her stance. “We’re not leaving this behind. We’ll use it as a guide—Dominic’s mistakes, his wisdom. But we have to keep moving. Staying here too long… it doesn’t feel right.”

Talon nodded, but he could feel Griffin’s judgmental stare lingering as he slipped the journal into his pack. As they left the cabin, the atmosphere seemed to cling to them, the weight of Dominic’s warnings pressing down like a shroud. Talon felt the medallion pulsing faintly, as if in response to the journal’s message. For a moment, he almost believed it was alive, whispering its own secrets to him, secrets he wasn’t yet prepared to understand.

As they stepped back into the forest, the trees seemed denser, darker, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. And somewhere, deeper in the woods, the faintest echo of a hum drifted through the silence, an unseen presence stirring, as if awakened by their intrusion.

The path ahead felt narrow and fraught, and Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched, followed.
