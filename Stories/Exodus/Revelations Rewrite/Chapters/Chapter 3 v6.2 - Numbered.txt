Chapter 3: Into the Heat

[P1] The air was thick and heavy, each step dragging them deeper into the oppressive heat of the forest. The storm had broken, but its remnants clung to the trees, beads of water slipping from limbs and pooling on the forest floor. With every step, the mud sucked at their boots, slowing them down, as if the forest itself were reluctant to let them pass.

[P2] “Feels like walking through a swamp,” Griffin muttered, slapping at the cloud of mosquitoes that buzzed relentlessly around him. He grimaced, wiping the sweat from his brow, his usual composure cracking under the barrage of bites. “I swear these things have been waiting for us.”

[P3] Sari swatted a mosquito off her arm, grimacing as another darted straight for her face. “Maybe they’re allies of Metis,” she joked, though her eyes were dark with irritation.

[P4] Talon gave a weak smile, the medallion’s weight pulling heavily at his neck as he adjusted it under his shirt. It was warm against his chest, like a sunbeam that wouldn’t fade, a constant reminder of the vision that had led them here. He tried to focus on the familiar pull, on the sense of purpose that had driven him into the forest, but Griffin’s grumbling broke through his concentration.

[P5] “You remember Red Arrow Camp?” Griffin asked, his tone lightening slightly as he glanced over at Talon. “That summer by the lake? You nearly lost a whole night’s sleep fighting off mosquitoes there too.”

[P6] Talon chuckled, swatting at a mosquito that buzzed too close. “I remember. And you were ready to call it quits before sundown.” He grinned, letting himself sink into the memory. “You said we were under ‘full-scale attack.’”

[P7] Griffin laughed, shaking his head. “Hey, that’s because we were. But I lasted longer than you give me credit for. Besides, you were the one who thought standing in the water would keep them off you.”

[P8] Sari gave a snort, raising an eyebrow. “Wait—you thought mosquitoes wouldn’t find you in the water?”

[P9] “Seemed logical at the time,” Talon admitted, laughing as he recalled the image of his younger self standing ankle-deep in the lake, surrounded by buzzing insects. “Turns out they’re persistent little demons.”

[P10] “Yeah, well, I was about ready to set up camp in a tent made out of mosquito netting.” Griffin grinned, wiping his brow as they continued to trudge through the dense underbrush. “Those were the days, huh? Just us, the lake, and a swarm of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.”

[P11] Sari shook her head, but there was a smile on her lips. “So basically, not much has changed.”

[P12] They laughed, the sound echoing faintly through the dense forest, blending with the rustling of leaves and the constant drone of insects. For a moment, the oppressive heat and the fatigue seemed to fade, replaced by the warmth of shared memories, the bond they’d forged through years of friendship.

[P13] But the forest was unyielding, each step forward feeling heavier as they moved deeper into its shadowed heart. The ground grew steeper, the mud thicker, and the air somehow even more stifling. Talon’s gaze drifted toward the distant mountains, barely visible through the canopy, their dark shapes etched against the sky like silent sentinels.

[P14] “Parque de Santiago,” he murmured, half to himself. “We must’ve entered somewhere near there.” He tried to gauge their distance, estimating how far they might have come. It felt like miles, though in the thick of the forest, distance seemed to stretch and blur, each step dragging them further into the unknown.

[P15] Griffin looked over, catching the faint uncertainty in Talon’s expression. “So, fearless leader, any idea where we’re actually headed?”

[P16] Talon hesitated, his fingers brushing against the medallion, feeling its faint warmth through his shirt. “The medallion… it’s guiding me. Or at least, I think it is. There’s something—” He broke off, glancing at Griffin, knowing how it must sound. “It’s like I’m being pulled, but I can’t explain it.”

[P17] Griffin’s face was a mixture of skepticism and something else, a hint of the trust they’d built over years that softened his usual edge. “You’ve always had a weird instinct, Talon. Just… don’t get us lost.”

[P18] “Don’t worry,” Sari added, smirking. “We’ll be fine. As long as we have a solid backup plan in case Talon’s ‘instinct’ starts acting up.”

[P19] Talon forced a smile, but his fingers lingered on the medallion. He could feel the pull, faint but steady, like a thread tying him to something unseen. Somewhere in his mind, Dominic’s words echoed—the warnings, the confessions, the way the man had spoken of being called into the shadows.

[P20] His gaze drifted to the journal in his pack. He hadn’t shared everything yet, and with each step forward, the weight of what he hadn’t said seemed to grow heavier. Griffin’s jokes, Sari’s calm support… they grounded him, reminded him of why they’d come this far together. But he knew that if he revealed everything, the darkness Dominic hinted at, the things left unsaid, would start to creep into their group like the forest’s shadows.

[P21] They moved in silence, the laughter from earlier fading into a solemn quiet. The trees closed in tighter, branches forming a tangled canopy above that blocked out the sun, casting the forest floor into a twilight gloom. The air grew thicker, heavier, as if the very atmosphere were trying to press them back, resisting their presence.

[P22] Sari was the first to speak, her voice barely more than a whisper. “Do you feel that?” She looked around, her gaze darting from tree to tree, as if sensing something lurking just out of sight.

[P23] Talon nodded, his hand instinctively reaching for the medallion. The pull was stronger now, a low, insistent hum that thrummed against his chest, guiding him forward even as every instinct told him to turn back.

[P24] Griffin frowned, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword, his gaze alert as if sensing unseen eyes. His other hand brushed his dagger, ready for any close threat. “I don’t like this. Feels like we’re being watched.”

[P25] The words hung in the air, thick with tension. Talon felt a shiver crawl down his spine, a sense of foreboding settling over him like a shroud. He tried to shake it off, focusing on the steady rhythm of his steps, on the pull of the medallion, on the mission that had driven them this far.

[P26] But the feeling persisted, growing stronger with each step, until it was almost unbearable.

[P27] And then he saw them.

[P28] At first, they were just shadows, flickering at the edges of his vision. But as he squinted, the shadows took shape—dark, humanoid figures moving through the trees, their forms shifting and flickering like smoke.

[P29] “Eidolons,” he breathed, the word slipping out before he could stop it.

[P30] Sari and Griffin tensed, their gazes snapping to the shadows as the figures grew clearer, more defined. The Eidolons moved with an unnatural grace, their eyes glinting with a cold, predatory light that sent a chill down Talon’s spine.

[P31] “Get ready,” Griffin muttered, drawing his sword with a sharp, practiced motion, his stance shifting into a defensive position. His dagger remained at his side, ready if needed.

[P32] Talon felt his heart hammering in his chest, his grip tightening on the medallion. The visions from his dreams, the shadows that had haunted him, they were here, real and tangible, no longer confined to the edges of his mind.

[P33] Sari stepped closer, her voice low and steady. “We don’t know what they want. Stay calm, don’t provoke them.”

[P34] But even as she spoke, the Eidolons moved closer, their forms shifting and flickering, their eyes fixed on the trio with a hunger that was almost palpable.

[P35] Talon swallowed, his mouth dry as he took a step back. The medallion pulsed against his chest, its warmth a strange contrast to the cold dread that had settled over him.

[P36] “They’re not going to let us pass,” Griffin muttered, his gaze locked on the approaching figures. “We either stand our ground or we’re done.”

[P37] Talon glanced at Sari, a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. But she met his gaze, her expression unwavering, a quiet strength radiating from her as she squared her shoulders.

[P38] “We stand,” she said simply, her voice filled with a calm resolve that steadied Talon’s racing heart.

[P39] The Eidolons moved closer, their forms twisting and flickering, their cold eyes locked onto the trio as they braced themselves for the fight.

[P40] And then, with a sudden, almost imperceptible shift, they lunged.

[P41] Talon barely had time to react, his instincts kicking in as he raised the medallion, its light flaring to life in a blinding flash that sent the Eidolons stumbling back, their forms scattering like smoke.

[P42] Griffin was next, his sword flashing as he swung it in a wide arc, cutting through the shadows with precision born of years of practice. The dagger on his belt remained in place, a backup he rarely needed.

[P43] But for every Eidolon they struck down, two more seemed to take its place, their forms shifting and reforming, their eyes cold and unfeeling as they pressed forward, relentless in their pursuit.

[P44] Talon felt his strength waning, his vision blurring as the medallion’s light began to flicker, its warmth fading as he struggled to keep his grip.

[P45] Panic clawed at Talon’s chest as he felt the medallion’s light fading. The shadows pressed closer, cold and unyielding, their eyes glinting with a predatory hunger. He froze, his grip loosening on the medallion as a wave of helplessness washed over him.

[P46] “Talon!” Sari’s voice cut through the chaos, fierce and unrelenting. “Fear is a chain—break it!”

[P47] Her words jolted him, echoing the quiet wisdom she’d shared earlier. But now, they burned with a new urgency, pushing him past his hesitation. He forced his hands steady, feeling the medallion’s pulse thrum in response as he summoned his strength, courage shattering the grip of his fear.

[P48] The medallion flared to life again, its light searing through the shadows as the Eidolons recoiled, their forms scattering like smoke in the wind. Talon took a deep breath, grounding himself as the light pulsed steadily against his chest, a lifeline in the darkness.

[P49] Griffin’s voice rang out, sharp and focused. “Don’t let up! Keep them back!”

[P50] Talon nodded, feeling a renewed surge of energy as he pressed forward, the medallion’s light blazing with a fierce intensity that seemed to drive the shadows back. Beside him, Griffin and Sari fought with a relentless determination, their movements synchronized as they pushed the Eidolons away, step by step.

[P51] But the Eidolons were relentless, their forms reforming as quickly as they fell, their eyes fixed on the trio with a cold, unyielding hunger. Talon gritted his teeth, feeling the weight of their gaze pressing down on him, a constant reminder of the darkness that surrounded them.

[P52] “We have to find a way out,” he gasped, his voice strained as he glanced around, searching for an escape.

[P53] Sari’s gaze flicked to him, a flash of understanding in her eyes. “We can’t keep this up forever. The medallion’s light—it’s our only advantage.”

[P54] Griffin nodded, his face set in a grim determination. “Then let’s use it. Talon, keep that thing glowing. We’ll cover you.”

[P55] Talon took a deep breath, feeling the medallion’s warmth pulsing against his chest as he focused, willing its light to burn brighter. The shadows seemed to waver, the Eidolons’ forms flickering as the light intensified, pushing them back inch by inch.

[P56] With a final surge of strength, Talon raised the medallion high, its light blazing through the darkness in a searing flash that sent the Eidolons scattering, their forms dissolving into the shadows as they retreated, slipping back into the forest.

[P57] The silence that followed was thick, heavy with the echoes of the battle. Talon lowered the medallion, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he staggered, feeling the weight of exhaustion settling over him.

[P58] Sari placed a steadying hand on his shoulder, her touch grounding him as he fought to catch his breath. “You did it,” she murmured, her voice filled with quiet pride. “You broke through.”

[P59] Griffin sheathed his sword, casting a wary glance around them. “Let’s not stick around to see if they come back. We need to move. Now.”

[P60] Talon nodded, his legs feeling like lead as he forced himself to stand, the medallion’s light dimming to a faint glow against his chest. They moved forward, their steps slow and unsteady, the weight of the battle pressing down on them as they continued deeper into the unknown.
