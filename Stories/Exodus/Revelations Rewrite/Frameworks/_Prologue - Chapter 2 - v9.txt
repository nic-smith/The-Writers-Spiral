## **Prologue: Talon’s Vision and Awakening**

### **Purpose**: 
To introduce Talon’s link to the medallion and foreshadow the threat of Metis through a powerful, disorienting vision. Establish Talon’s internal struggle with the medallion’s draw and the toll it takes on him. Briefly reveal the group dynamic, emphasizing Sari’s empathy and Griffin’s protective skepticism, which later becomes mistrust. 

### **Writing Style**: 
- **Atmosphere**: Dark and disorienting with gothic, surreal overtones. The scene feels almost dreamlike yet foreboding, creating a haunting tone that merges Talon’s internal dread with supernatural visuals.
- **Tone**: Apocalyptic and somber, underscoring Talon’s disorientation and reluctance with undertones of psychological horror.
- **Symbolic Imagery**: Blurring between reality and vision to hint at cosmic horror; descriptions of ruins, fading symbols, and shadowy figures evoke the veil’s mystical, terrifying nature.

### **Key Events**:
1. **Talon’s Hallucinogenic Vision**:
   - **Scene**: Talon is swept into a haunting vision of ruins veiled in shadow, as ancient symbols glow faintly in a darkened sky. He feels the pull of a figure watching him with hollow, almost lifeless eyes. The vision feels powerful and magnetic, forcing him toward the shadowed figure, but Talon senses a vast, unseen danger and tries to resist.
   - **Connection to Metis**: The shadowed figure, while unclear, hints at Metis’s presence as an otherworldly force, ominous and grand. Talon feels both fear and compulsion, suggesting an inevitable, larger threat beyond his control.

2. **Physical and Mental Toll**:
   - **Scene**: Talon awakens suddenly, drenched in sweat, shaking, and gasping for air. His body feels cold and weak, and he feels a lingering physical heaviness from the medallion’s pull. He instinctively reaches for it but recoils at its cold weight, emphasizing his fear of its influence.

3. **Group Interaction**:
   - **Moment with Sari**: Sari stirs, sensing his distress, and their eyes meet briefly. Her calm acknowledgment suggests a shared understanding without words, hinting at her intuitive sense of his inner turmoil.
   - **Griffin’s Watchfulness**: Griffin is close by, his expression subtly cautious. He notes Talon’s unease but keeps his thoughts guarded, displaying protectiveness mixed with a hint of skepticism.

### **Emotional State**:
- **Talon**: Haunted, fearful, physically drained, yet oddly fascinated by the medallion’s pull. He feels compelled but deeply disturbed, sensing the medallion is beyond his control.
- **Sari**: Concerned but quietly supportive, subtly watching both Talon and Griffin with empathy and awareness.
- **Griffin**: Protective, subtly cautious, with early hints of skepticism, feeling a sense of duty to shield the group, even from within.

### **Writing Style Notes**:
- **Descriptions** should be vivid yet slightly surreal, giving the reader a sense of Talon’s blurred reality and emphasizing the medallion’s eerie influence.
- **Dialogue** is minimal; expressions and body language should convey the characters’ reactions to each other.
- **Symbolic Imagery** of the vision—ruins, shadows, ancient symbols—should create a cosmic, terrifying atmosphere that blurs lines between vision and reality.

## **Chapter 1: Into the Deep Forest and the Cabin Discovery**

### **Purpose**: 
Build subtle tension within the group as they navigate a hostile forest, setting up Griffin’s initial skepticism and distrust. The cabin introduces Dominic’s diary, giving Griffin a tangible “reason” for his growing mistrust of Talon and establishing his alignment with Dominic’s perspective. Sari’s stabilizing influence is gently revealed as she balances Griffin’s skepticism and Talon’s struggle.

### **Writing Style**:
- **Atmosphere**: Haunted, immersive, with a strong sense of foreboding as the group moves deeper into the forest and discovers the eerie, desolate cabin.
- **Tone**: Survivalist and tense, with a sense of growing urgency as the forest resists their presence.
- **Gothic Influence**: Descriptions of the forest should feel oppressive and alive, almost like a character that pushes back against them.

### **Key Events**:
1. **Survival and Tension in the Forest**:
   - **Scene**: The group trudges through dense forest, scratched and bruised as branches pull at their clothing and underbrush catches on their packs. Griffin, at the front, uses his sword to clear a path with growing irritation. His gaze frequently shifts to Talon as he notices Talon’s hand instinctively reaching for the medallion.
   - **Early Skepticism**: Griffin’s protectiveness intensifies as he begins to question Talon’s reliance on the medallion. His thoughts drift to worst-case scenarios, subtly feeding his suspicion of Talon’s intentions and the medallion’s true purpose.

2. **Arrival at the Cabin – Haunting Discovery**:
   - **Setting**: The cabin appears abandoned and sinister, with remnants of former occupants—a rusted axe, a broken-down fence, and pieces of rotting wood scattered around. The place feels like it once had purpose but has since decayed.
   - **Griffin’s Role**: Practical and driven, Griffin enters first, assessing the cabin as shelter while Sari and Talon hesitate. Griffin’s impatience and protectiveness show in his movements, contrasting with Sari’s quiet watchfulness.

3. **Exploring the Cabin – Sparse Supplies and Discovery of the Diary**:
   - **Interior Details**: Inside, the cabin is dark and stale, filled with broken furniture and debris. They find a couple of cans of food, a brief relief from their hunger. The setting feels both a reprieve and a potential trap, heightening tension.
   - **Discovery of Dominic’s Diary**: Griffin uncovers an old, weathered diary in the back room. As he reads through Dominic’s reflections on his role and the dangers of the Veil, his expression darkens, and his internal mistrust deepens.

4. **Diary’s Impact on Griffin**:
   - **Content of the Diary**: Dominic’s entries reveal his time in Daniel’s group, his role as protector, and his fears surrounding the Veil. He describes a creeping paranoia about Daniel’s power and his regret for ever allowing the Veil to take control.
   - **Validation of Griffin’s Suspicion**: Griffin connects with Dominic’s words, seeing them as proof of his own fears. He views the medallion as a danger, aligning himself with Dominic’s warnings as justification for his own guarded stance.

5. **Group Discussion – Sari’s Balance and Decision to Move Forward**:
   - **Sari’s Influence**: Sari notices Griffin’s reaction to the diary and gently suggests they use it as a guide rather than a prophecy. Her calming influence keeps Griffin’s fears in check, though he maintains his private doubts.
   - **Unified Decision**: The group agrees to use the diary as a lead to find an ally who might help them. However, Griffin’s mistrust begins to grow more tangible, and he subtly distances himself from Talon.

6. **Transition Scene – Leaving the Cabin and Rising Suspicion**:
   - **Scene**: As they leave, the forest seems to grow more hostile, with shadows thickening and strange sounds echoing around them. Griffin remains hyper-aware of Talon, his wariness intensifying.
   - **Foreshadowing the Ambush**: Subtle sounds—a low hum, a rustle—create a creeping sense of anticipation. Griffin’s stance becomes tense, convinced that Talon’s medallion may be attracting something sinister.

### **Emotional State**:
- **Talon**: Anxious but resolved, aware of Griffin’s guarded demeanor and feeling burdened by the medallion’s pull.
- **Sari**: Empathetic and grounded, gently balancing the group’s growing tension with quiet reassurances.
- **Griffin**: Growing skeptical and wary, feeling a protective duty to shield the group even if it means guarding against Talon.

### **Writing Style Notes**:
- **Narrative Tension**: Create subtle tension through Griffin’s inner dialogue and cautious glances.
- **Symbolic Imagery**: The cabin’s decay mirrors the internal doubts and growing fractures in the group.
- **Dialogue** should reveal layers of mistrust and restraint, building anticipation for future conflict.

## **Chapter 2: The Eidolon Ambush and Deepening Distrust**

### **Purpose**: 
Raise the stakes with a chilling Eidolon ambush that tests each character’s vulnerability. Solidify Griffin’s belief that the medallion is a danger and Talon cannot be trusted. Emphasize Sari’s emotional toll and the psychological horror of the forest’s lurking threats.

### **Writing Style**:
- **Atmosphere**: Heavy and foreboding, filled with shadows and primal fear.
- **Tone**: Dark, urgent, with rising horror; the forest feels alive, almost malevolent.
- **Psychological Horror**: Create a sense of dread and disorientation, amplifying the characters’ fears.

### **Key Events**:

   - **Foreshadowing**: Strange sounds grow louder, creating an atmosphere of dread. Griffin’s gaze becomes intense, believing Talon’s medallion may have attracted the approaching danger.

2. **The Eidolon Ambush**:
   - **Physical Attack**: Eidolons emerge from the shadows, skeletal and predatory, surrounding the group. Their coordinated movements create a sense of inescapable threat.
   - **Psychological Attacks**: Each Eidolon exploits a fear—Griffin sees Talon in a twisted, dark form; Sari briefly envisions someone she once failed. This amplifies their psychological strain and mirrors Griffin’s deepening mistrust.

3. **Talon’s Mistake and Sari’s Injury**:
   - **Scene**: Talon uses the medallion in desperation, but its power misfires, injuring Sari. This serves as “proof” for Griffin, who sees the incident as validation of his distrust.

4. **Griffin’s Isolation and Conviction**:
   - **Scene**: Griffin mentally commits to guarding the group from Talon’s influence, seeing himself as a necessary protector. He rationalizes his mistrust as duty, solidifying his role as a quiet skeptic.

5. **Sari’s Breakdown**:
   - **Scene**: After the ambush, Sari reaches her breaking point, her stress spilling into an emotional release. This underscores her strength and humanity, making her breakdown feel earned and impactful.

### **Emotional State**:
- **Griffin**: Suspicious, resolute, privately isolated in his conviction.
- **Talon**: Guilty and remorseful, burdened by his lack of control over the medallion.
- **Sari**: Exhausted, emotionally vulnerable, yet determined to keep the group together.

### **Writing Style Notes**:
- **Heightened Suspense**: Use horror imagery and psychological disorientation to build dread.
