  1. **Fragmented Group**: The group regroups post-betrayal, retreating to assess their injuries and options. Talon is barely responsive, haunted by visions of apocalyptic ruin symbolizing his self-doubt and fears of cosmic inevitability. These visions channel Revelation-inspired scenes—cracked earth, fallen pillars, ominous skies—implying Talon’s potential as a bringer of destruction.
  2. **Talon’s Collapse**: Talon’s fear of his own role intensifies as he slips into introspective visions. The medallion’s energy pulses ominously, revealing fractured images of his potential future, hinting that he may fulfill a role within an ancient prophecy.

  3. **Sari’s Leadership and Suspicions**: Sari, now the acting leader, takes control of the situation, guiding Griffin and attempting to protect Talon. She increasingly distrusts the medallion, seeing it as a corrupting force. Her protective instincts clash with her concern for Talon’s mental and emotional state.
  4. **Pull of the Veil**: Talon experiences a sudden surge from the medallion as the Veil’s power intensifies, drawing him deeper into visions. As he slips further, the chapter ends with Sari left alone to protect the group while Talon is submerged in his psychic journey.
