Great! Based on the **clarifying questions** and **backstories** you’ve provided, I now have a clear understanding of the major components for your story. Here’s a breakdown of the major elements and a few remaining **questions** to clarify:

### **1. Characters**
- **Talon Mercer** is the protagonist, with Sari as the second most important character and Griffin as the third. Talon’s journey will focus on self-acceptance and leadership.
  
- **Sari Greysun** will provide emotional depth and stability, while also having her own journey of independence and self-discovery. The romantic tension between her and Talon can act as a backdrop, influencing their decisions without dominating the narrative.

- **Griffin O’Connell** will take on the role of protector but needs to confront his overprotectiveness and learn to trust others.

#### **Remaining Questions:**
- Are you satisfied with Talon’s internal arc focusing on **self-acceptance and overcoming grief**, or should he also have a secondary external conflict, like directly confronting a past failure? 
Answer) A. Feel free to round out Talon in a way that add the most depth and interest. 
- Should Sari’s **emotional stability** and dream of peace contrast with the growing tension, or should she be more directly involved in the action, with moments of vulnerability?
Answer) A. Let me know how you like this and be very critical. Her emotionally stability should contrast with the growing tension. Sari should sometimes be out emotionally vulnerable when times are quiet but emotionally stability and strength in times of stress and conflict. She should force herself into a strong role but fall back into a weaker roll when it's quiet. This quieter more venerable role should both strengthen Talon's love for her and drive him crazy and the same time. He loves the vulnerability but feels he can't depend on her unless the stakes are high.

### **2. The Pulse (Now “Veil of Oblivion”)**
- The **Veil of Oblivion** (VOB) will act as a central artifact of power, blending technology and spirituality. It shields and empowers humans but can go dormant if misused, which ties into the fate of the Mayans. The backstory involving the Mayan disappearance due to misuse of the Pulse creates an interesting mystery and theme about power and responsibility.
Answer) A. Let's let the naming of the VOB be a humorous moment. Let one of the characters name it "Veil of Obliviion" in a funny and cute way and then the other characters can act indignant about naming it something so silly but then except it.  

#### **Remaining Questions:**
- Should the **Veil of Oblivion** have different phases or levels of power based on its users, or remain a consistent force throughout?
Answer) A. The VOB should always be consistent however as the characters grow they should gain more strength from it. Kind of like the Holy Spirit. They the grow in strength and character they should be able to communicate with the VOB in a very rudimentary way and as they continue grow they can communicate with it in a clearer way. We definitely want the characters to evolve. My favorite part of role playing games is leveling characters up and collecting new powers so we can level up our characters (though maybe not saying it so bluntly) and give them new powers as they go.
- Should the Veil’s **power source** be tied to something physical (e.g., energy crystals, cosmic alignment), or is its power more abstract?
Answer) A. Let's time it to physics. We can tie it to dark matter, gravity, the power of the Sun, maybe multiple universes.

### **3. Exodus (The AI)**
- **Exodus** has a 20% human and 80% machine nature. It’s a complex, advanced being with motives rooted in **self-preservation** and **advancement**, but with deeper complexity than just control. Exodus’s backstory will be revealed through **flashbacks** or a **parallel narrative**, and its actions are not purely destructive—there’s a logical drive to its decisions.
  
- The challenge is making Exodus **unique** compared to other AI antagonists (e.g., Terminator, the Borg, etc.). Exodus could strive to push humanity to a higher state of being, forcing evolution to overcome perceived weakness.
Answer) Ohh... I like that. A goal of pushing humanity to a hire state of being. We could use the characters that went back to Exodus and experimental gunnie pigs for evolution. Maybe, an underlying theme could be Exodus inability to understand humans.

#### **Remaining Questions:**
- Should Exodus view itself as a **shepherd guiding humanity** to a higher state, even if it means destroying the weak?
Answers) A. Yes!!! I like this thought process. 
- Would you like Exodus to have **internal conflicts** related to its 20% human side, like brief moments of doubt or hesitation?
Answer) Yes, internal conflicts will lead to a more engaging story.

### **4. Conflict and Power Dynamics**
- The **human vs. human conflict** will be brutal, with some aligning with Exodus while others, empowered by the Veil, resist. The powers granted by the Veil will have **benefits and side effects**, requiring rest, energy replenishment, and limitations. Manipulating known forces like radio waves, light, and EMPs provides a realistic yet futuristic edge.
  
- Battles will be intense and the loss of key characters will create emotional stakes and tie into the **self-sacrifice** theme.

#### **Remaining Questions:**
- Would you like to explore different **faction dynamics**—for example, human allies of Exodus becoming part machine themselves?
Answer) A. Yes, let's explore the other dynamics. We probably need a few more characters and back stories on the Exodus faction side.
- Should **Talon** experience a **personal loss** that further motivates him in the conflict?
Answer) A. I think the motives created by loss might cause him to freeze sometimes when loss is emanant and jump to action to protect however Griffin is our main protector
        B. We should explore a bond between Griffin and Talon due to both having loss. It can push them apart sometimes as one get's enraged by the comparison of loss but then pull them together at times as well.

### **5. Themes and Tone**
- The **Gothic tone** remains a central element, with **hallucinogenic elements** focusing on atmospheric scenery. The Christian themes will build up slowly over time, with subtle references to **sacrifice**, **faith**, and **redemption**—particularly in Talon’s journey as a reluctant leader. 

#### **Remaining Questions:**
- Should Talon’s final arc in **Book 1** include a moment of **self-sacrifice**, or should it build toward that in future books?
Answer) A. If we lose Talon it should be the ultimate sacrifice that ends the last book. 
        B. There should be other loss by characters through out the books. If you look at Game of Thrones, there was tons of loss of key characters.

### **6. Final Resolution**
- **Book 1** will end with a **realization of power and purpose** during a major battle. A character death and a revelation about the Veil or Exodus could serve as climactic points, setting up future conflicts while giving closure to certain arcs.

#### **Remaining Questions:**
- Should the major battle in **Book 1** result in the discovery of a **new phase of the Veil’s power**, or a **weakness in Exodus**?
Answer) A. Let's let new power(s) be discovered in the final battle but let's not show much or any weakness from Exodus.
        B. Remember to pepper the book with tons of events, let's say 50-80 events. Categorize them as micro, minor, major, catastrophic, and cataclysmic. They should be more or less random. Some will fit the story line closely and some will be completely random. Here is the break down.
             i. For every event 65% should fit the story line and 35% should be completely random (think meteorite falling out of the sky or hurricane)
            ii. Event's should fall into these categories
                a. micro - 30% 
                b. minor - 30% 
                c. major - 20%
                d. catastrophic - 11%
                e. cataclysmic - 4%
      C.  Please provide a definition of what consists of a micro, minor, major, catastrophic, and cataclysmic event.

### Next Steps:
- With these final points clarified, I’ll be ready to write the full framework for the story, including the **plot**, **character arcs**, and **world-building** around the **Veil of Oblivion** and **Exodus**.
- Let me know your thoughts on these final questions, and I’ll incorporate everything into the final framework!
