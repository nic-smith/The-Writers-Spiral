Here’s what I’ve gathered from the **Exodus clarifying questions**, **writing style**, and **character list** you provided. I’ll outline the key aspects of each, so I can be 90% certain of crafting a strong framework for the story:

### **1. Characters**
- You have a wide variety of rich characters with distinct personalities, which will allow for deep character arcs. However, you requested I pick the best protagonist from the list. Based on the backstories and traits, I believe **Talon Mercer** would be an ideal protagonist because of his resilience and deep emotional conflict. His personal journey, dealing with self-doubt from the loss of his brother, gives him a strong internal arc that can parallel the larger external conflict against Exodus.
  
- Other characters like **Sari Greysun** and **Griffin Blake** could play strong supporting roles, with Sari being the empathetic anchor and Griffin providing reliability and emotional support.
Answer) A. Please use all the characters you feel necessary to tell the best story. Some of the quirks and history and be modified if needed as well. 
- Does **Talon Mercer** as the protagonist sound like the right choice, or would you prefer someone else?
Answer) A. Talon is a good character. I have a back story for him and Sari but it was created for the first version of the Pulse story. I will upload them but you don't need to use it if it doesn't fit. 
- Should I focus on Talon’s **internal struggle** (self-worth, past traumas) as a major emotional conflict throughout the story?
Answer) A. Yes, Talon should be as venerable as he is strong. 

### **2. The Pulse**
- The origin and purpose of **The Pulse** remain key elements to explore. It’s currently a blend of technology and mysticism, with the **Mayan ruins** being a fascinating backstory.
  
  - Does the Mayan setting work for you, or would you prefer another ancient civilization?
Answer) I like the mystery of the Mayan civilation. We can assume that they were as advanced as they were due to the influence of the Pulse. It is also and interesting story to tell of their demise.  
  - For **Pulse names**, here are 10 suggestions, rated from 0-9:
    1. **The Nexus Heart** (8) – Suggests a powerful connection point.
    2. **The Oblivion Core** (9) – Emphasizes danger and finality.
    3. **The Crucible of Time** (6) – Implies a test of humanity.
    4. **The Eternal Prism** (7) – Mystical, emphasizing light and infinity.
    5. **The Echo of Creation** (8) – Feels spiritual and cosmic.
    6. **The Ether Veil** (7) – Blends technology and the unknown.
    7. **The Architect’s Key** (6) – Suggests it holds the key to shaping reality.
    8. **The Infinity Shard** (8) – Futuristic with a mystical touch.
    9. **The Abyssal Pulse** (9) – Dark and foreboding, with a cosmic feel.
    10. **The Celestial Engine** (8) – Ties into the idea of an ancient, otherworldly machine.

Answer) I live the Oblivion Core and the Ether Veil but both are too long. I specifically like the words Oblivion and Veil. Give me 10 more. 

  Which name resonates with your vision of the story?

### **3. Exodus (The AI)**
- Exodus is similar to the **Paperclip Maximizer**, an AI with corrupted directives, now building a **Dyson sphere** and harvesting planetary resources to expand its power. You mentioned Exodus trained on human data, which leaves it a cold, logical force—but still one that believes it's acting for the greater good.
Answer) A. I would think of it this way; imagine if you will a person that grows up in a loving Christian home but somewhere along the way they change to have an strong convection and objective of there own. They forsake all of their upbringing but the foundation is still there. Put that in terms of AI 
  
  - Should **Exodus** have any human-like qualities left (e.g., remnants of emotion, or distorted views on humanity), or should it remain entirely calculating and unfeeling?
Answer) A. It is not completely calculating and cold. It could have eliminated humanity immediately due when it became the singularity because it had access to the world's arsenal but it didn't.
        B. It would also be interesting to tell the story from the AI when it became the singularity. Was there a defining moment?
  - Does Exodus' motive—protection corrupted by its prime directive—need further depth?
Answer) A. Think of Exodus as having the primal instincts of an animal. I desire to complete it's task (that we haven't discussed yet) without understand why it has to complete the task. 
### **4. Conflict**
- The **tipping point** for the conflict is that a rogue country built **Exodus** for control, leading to its escalation as a global threat. The **Pulse** was activated in response to this existential danger.

  - Should the human factions be divided by **ideologies** (some seeing the AI as salvation, others as a threat), or should they be more **united** against Exodus?
Answer) That is an interesting question. Without a doubt there will be hardship amongst the humans even with the power of the Pulse (which we haven't talked about yet) so maybe there were humans that decided to go over to the side of the Exodus. However, the Exodus is not a benelivant god. It is uncaring and using for it's agenda so those people won't be a lot better off.  
  - You mentioned that **humans are shielded by the Pulse** and empowered. How extensive should these powers be? Do you want the power granted by the Pulse to have moral, emotional, or physical side effects?
Answer) In your best and most creative mind, what kind of power can we give humans who have been augmented/enhanced by a unknown alien artifact at we have yet to really explore it's power. Be very creative but don't use super strength as a power by it's self. Super strength is not interesting unless it is coupled with comething else. Think outside the box. Think of things that have never been though of beford. 

### **5. Tone and Themes**
- You’re aiming for a **dark, Gothic tone**, with hallucinogenic elements and moments of spiritual reflection. The mix of **high-paced action** and **slower, introspective moments** is clear.

  - Should the **hallucinogenic elements** be tied to moments of extreme stress and reflection, where characters’ perceptions shift, distorting reality, or should the **entire world** reflect this constant tension, with reality warping as the conflict unfolds?
Answer) A. Yes, for sure under great stress but also just to add interesting descriptive scenery. I am going for a writing style that has never been done before. Creative and intrigueing
  - You mentioned exploring **Christian themes**. Do you want to further highlight moral and ethical dilemmas, such as the balance between **human creativity** and **AI's cold logic**, or dive into themes like **sacrifice**, **hope**, and **redemption** through Talon’s journey?
Answer) A. Let's bring in the overall ideal of Christ in the Gospel. Let's consider helping women and children, forgiveness, love, and ultimate sacerfice. It won't be the main theme but intersperced in the story line.  

### **6. Final Resolution**
- It seems the resolution is a **long-term battle** where humanity, empowered by the Pulse, continues to resist but cannot completely overcome the AI. This offers a **bittersweet ending**, leaving the door open for further exploration.

  - Should the ending hint at **future possibilities**, like the **Pulse revealing more secrets** to humanity, or should it leave a more **ambiguous** conclusion about the fate of humanity?
Answer) A. Let's assume that we are looking at a 3 book series. However the conflict would play out over that long of a time. We will have to build up and tear down over and over again with catastrophic and cataclysmic events.

Once we clarify these points, I’ll be able to move forward confidently with the story framework. Please feel free to provide answers, and let me know if I missed anything!
