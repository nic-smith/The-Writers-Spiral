### **Talon Mercer’s Backstory**

#### **1. Early Life**
Talon Mercer grew up in a small town where high academic achievement was highly valued. As the middle child in a family that placed immense pressure on success, Talon often felt overshadowed by the accomplishments of his older brother. His parents, well-respected educators, instilled in him a strong work ethic, leading Talon to constantly seek validation. However, this created an environment of competition, and he often grappled with feelings of inadequacy.

#### **2. Artistic Talent and Competition**
From a young age, Talon displayed a natural talent for art, which he cherished as a way to express his emotions. However, this talent was often overlooked in favor of his brother’s achievements in academics and sports. As a result, Talon began to distance himself from his family’s expectations and sought validation in other areas, such as outdoor activities and sports, but he struggled to find his place and purpose.

#### **3. Adolescence and Rebellion**
During his teenage years, Talon experienced a rebellious phase, trying to break free from the suffocating expectations of his family. He engaged in outdoor adventures, becoming proficient in survival skills, navigation, and foraging. This connection to nature provided him with a sense of freedom and adventure, offering a welcome escape from the pressures of home life.

#### **4. Connection with Sari**
It was during this time that Talon developed a close bond with Sari Greysun. Their shared moments of creativity and exploration allowed Talon to escape the weight of his family’s expectations. Sari became a safe haven for him, providing emotional support and encouragement. Their relationship blossomed, fostering a deep friendship grounded in mutual understanding and shared experiences.

#### **5. The Festival of Lights Incident**
During the annual **Festival of Lights**, a beloved tradition in the town celebrating the changing seasons, Talon volunteered to help set up the event. While preparing, he discovered an old, ornate lantern hidden away in the attic of the town hall. Intrigued, he took the lantern home to clean it up for the festival.

As he polished the lantern, he noticed strange symbols etched into its surface, which he initially dismissed as decorative. However, during the festival, as townsfolk lit their lanterns, Talon unintentionally triggered a reaction from the old lantern. It began to glow with an otherworldly light, and a sudden wind swept through the area, causing chaos as other lanterns flickered and dimmed.

This incident drew a mysterious connection to the Pulse, coinciding with the onset of strange phenomena in the town. Talon became consumed with curiosity about the lantern and its origins, leading him to research its history and uncover local legends related to the Pulse.

The chaos created by the lantern drew Sari, Griffin, and others closer to Talon. They rallied together to investigate its origins, deepening their bonds and revealing hidden talents and strengths within each character. This moment forced Talon to confront his fears and doubts. Initially overwhelmed by the chaos he unintentionally caused, he learned to embrace his role in the community and take responsibility for his actions.

The lantern became a metaphor for Talon’s own journey; just as it illuminated the darkness during the festival, Talon learned to shine a light on his insecurities and fears, ultimately becoming a guiding force for his friends as they faced the challenges posed by the Pulse.

#### **6. Struggles with Identity and Grief**
After losing his brother in a tragic accident, Talon was consumed by guilt and grief. He felt he had failed to protect him, and this loss intensified his feelings of inadequacy. While Sari helped him process his emotions, he became fearful of burdening her with his pain, leading to an internal struggle with self-worth. Talon grappled with the belief that he might not be deserving of happiness or success.

#### **7. Current Motivations**
Now in his late teens, Talon yearns for stability and a sense of purpose. He desires a successful career, believing that it will provide the direction he seeks. However, he is haunted by the fear that pursuing his dreams might lead him away from Sari, whom he deeply values. This fear of abandonment is a driving force in his life, making him question his abilities and worthiness in both their relationship and his future.
