**Markdown Guidelines for Chapter Markup**

These instructions outline the structure, tagging, and formatting rules for chapters in your project to ensure consistency and clarity.

---

### **General Structure**
Each chapter is organized into sequentially numbered paragraphs with the following format:

#### **Paragraph Structure**:
```
## P[number]

- **Tags**:  
  - #[tag1]  
  - #[tag2]  

- **Content**: [The main narrative content for the paragraph.]

- **Notes**: [Optional insights, commentary, or details not immediately obvious in the content.]
```

---

### **Guidelines for Each Section**

#### **1. Paragraph Numbering**
- Number paragraphs sequentially starting from `## P1`.
- Avoid duplicate or skipped numbers.

#### **2. Tags**
- Begin with `- **Tags**:` followed by a list of thematic tags.
- Each tag starts with a `#` and is relevant to the paragraph’s primary focus.
- Limit to 2-4 tags per paragraph to avoid redundancy.

**Examples of Tags**:
- #character
- #dialogue
- #conflict
- #discovery
- #worldbuilding

**Avoid**:
- Repeating generic tags like `#character` and `#setting` across consecutive paragraphs unless absolutely necessary.
- Including secondary or tangentially related tags.

#### **3. Content**
- Begin with `- **Content**:` and include the main narrative text.
- Ensure clear, vivid descriptions and varied language to avoid repetitive phrasing.

**Focus on**:
- Action, atmosphere, and character dynamics.
- Avoiding overused phrases (e.g., "the medallion’s pull" in multiple paragraphs).

#### **4. Notes**
- Begin with `- **Notes**:` and provide additional insights, context, or interpretative commentary.
- Keep notes concise and analytical. Avoid restating the content.

**Examples of Good Notes**:
- "Hints at Griffin’s hidden resentment toward Talon."
- "Foreshadows the group's eventual confrontation with the artifact's power."

**Avoid**:
- Summarizing content already present in the narrative.
- Overly verbose notes exceeding 2-3 sentences.

### **Formatting Guidelines**

#### **1. Spacing**
- Ensure **one blank line** separates each section (`Tags`, `Content`, `Notes`).
- Avoid extra blank lines within sections.

#### **2. Metadata Placement**
- Place metadata (e.g., chapter title, revision notes) at the top of the document.
- Example:
  ```
  # Chapter 1: [Title]

  Revision Notes: Updated tags and improved flow for P1-P12.
  ```

#### **3. Descriptions**
- Use varied and engaging descriptions to maintain reader interest.
- Avoid repeating similar phrases across multiple paragraphs.

### **Submission Template**
Here’s a quick example of a well-structured paragraph:

```
## P1

- **Tags**:  
  - #worldbuilding  
  - #setting

- **Content**: The air was thick and heavy, each step dragging them deeper into the oppressive heat of the forest. The storm had broken, but its remnants clung to the trees, beads of water slipping from branches and pooling on the forest floor.

- **Notes**: Establishes the oppressive atmosphere of the forest and reflects the group’s physical exhaustion.
```

### **How to Use This Document**
1. Apply this structure and formatting to all chapters.
2. Focus on the narrative first, then refine tags, content, and notes in subsequent edits.
3. Submit completed chapters for review using this markup format.
