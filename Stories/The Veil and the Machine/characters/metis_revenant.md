# The Revenant: Métis's Ultimate Defense Bot

## **Overview**
The Revenant is Métis’s ultimate defense bot—a one-of-a-kind creation designed for stealth, speed, and precision. With unmatched intelligence and engineering, it embodies the pinnacle of robotic evolution. This lone sentinel operates in the shadows, striking with surgical accuracy and vanishing before its presence is ever detected.
