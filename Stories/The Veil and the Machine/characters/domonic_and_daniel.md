- **Tags**:  
  - #dialogue

---  

## P16  

- **Tags**:  
  - #character

Or are we talking ‘lost in the jungle’ kind of hidden?”

---  

## P17  

- **Tags**:  
  - #dialogue  
  - #challenge  

- **Content**: “That’s the question,” Daniel replied, his tone steady. “The last part of the story is vague. Something about the family fleeing into the jungle during an attack.

  - #dialogue
