Chapter 2:

---

The forest was darker than it should have been for midday, the canopy above so thick it blocked much of the sunlight, casting everything in a dim, greenish gloom. The air felt close, heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. They moved in tense silence, each footfall muffled by the thick moss carpeting the forest floor, and every snap of a twig underfoot seemed to echo too loudly in the stillness.

Griffin was at the front, his grip on his sword tense, his eyes sharp as they scanned the forest ahead. Talon walked a few steps behind, feeling the weight of Dominic’s journal in his pack and the steady pulse of the medallion against his chest. He’d tried to shake off the cabin’s eerie hold on him, but Dominic’s words lingered, a warning he couldn’t ignore.

Sari moved between them, her movements quiet and graceful, though her face was etched with weariness. She hadn’t spoken much since they’d left the cabin, and Talon could sense the heaviness in her demeanor—a burden she carried silently, watching the two men with quiet resolve. The forest around them seemed to press closer, the silence amplifying every rustle, every whisper of movement from the underbrush.

Talon glanced up, catching sight of Griffin’s rigid back. The tension between them was like a wound that hadn’t healed, and he could feel Griffin’s distrust growing, a quiet judgment Talon couldn’t ignore.

“Something doesn’t feel right,” Sari murmured, breaking the silence. She slowed her pace, scanning their surroundings with a wary look. “The forest… it’s too quiet.”

Griffin nodded, his face set in a grim expression. “It’s like we’re being watched.” His hand tightened on his sword hilt, and his gaze cut briefly toward Talon, a look that carried a silent message—almost as if he believed the medallion was to blame for whatever unease haunted the forest.

Talon resisted the urge to reach for the medallion, feeling its cold weight against his chest, as if it were aware of the mounting tension between them. Instead, he focused on keeping his senses sharp, forcing himself to ignore the faint pulsing that seemed to echo through his body.

Suddenly, a soft rustling sounded from somewhere to their left. They froze, each of them turning instinctively toward the sound. The rustling grew louder, moving through the underbrush in a slow, steady rhythm, like something large stalking just beyond the edge of sight. Talon’s pulse quickened, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling with a sense of dread.

Griffin held up a hand, signaling for silence. His face was set, eyes narrowed as he scanned the dense foliage. The seconds stretched painfully, the silence thickening around them until every breath felt amplified.

Then, from deeper within the trees, came a low, haunting sound—a kind of purr, deep and rumbling, vibrating through the air. It sent a chill down Talon’s spine, freezing the blood in his veins. The sound grew louder, as if the creature making it was circling them, its presence hidden yet tangible, pressing in on all sides.

Sari’s eyes widened, and she took a step back, her hand hovering near the dagger at her side. “What… what is that?”

Griffin’s face hardened, his voice barely a whisper. “Eidolons.”

Talon felt his heart drop. He’d heard stories about these creatures—shadowy figures that moved like ghosts through the forest, rarely seen but always felt. No one knew exactly what they were, but tales described them as creatures born of darkness, as much a part of the forest as the trees themselves. He glanced at Sari, seeing his own fear reflected in her eyes.

The purring grew louder, shifting to a clicking sound that echoed in every direction, disorienting them. Talon’s grip tightened on his weapon, his gaze flicking toward the shadows, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. His mind raced, struggling to recall anything that might help them survive an encounter with these creatures.

Without warning, a shape darted between the trees, a dark, sleek figure that moved with unnatural speed. Talon barely caught a glimpse of it—a flash of something skeletal, with limbs that bent at impossible angles, its movements unnervingly smooth. Another shape followed, and then another, the shadows alive with shifting forms that seemed to melt into the darkness, only to reappear a second later.

Griffin raised his sword, his stance tense but ready. “Stay close,” he whispered, his voice edged with urgency. “They hunt in packs. Don’t let them separate us.”

Sari’s hand found Talon’s arm, her grip firm, grounding him as they pressed together, forming a small, defensive circle. Talon could feel the weight of the medallion pulsing stronger now, as if it were feeding off the tension, amplifying his fear even as it drew him toward its power.

The forest seemed to hold its breath, waiting. And then, the Eidolons attacked.

The Eidolons closed in, moving like shadows with bone-chilling speed, their bodies sleek and contorted, half-seen figures that blended with the darkness. Talon’s breath caught as one lunged at him, a blur of limbs and gleaming eyes. He barely had time to bring up his weapon, feeling the impact reverberate through his arms as he parried it away. The creature retreated with an unsettling, inhuman grace, circling back to blend seamlessly into the shadows.

Beside him, Griffin swung his sword with brutal precision, his face set in fierce concentration. Each strike was swift, practiced, but the Eidolons seemed to anticipate his every move, slipping away before his blade could connect. They moved as one, circling and darting forward with a relentless energy that was both mesmerizing and horrifying.

Sari kept her dagger close, her back pressed against Talon’s, eyes wide as she tracked each flicker of movement. Her breaths were shallow, controlled, but Talon could feel the tension radiating from her in waves. They were surrounded, and every time one of the Eidolons seemed to fade into the trees, another took its place, their numbers impossible to count in the low light.

The purring, clicking sounds grew louder, echoing in the dense forest as the creatures communicated in a language all their own. Talon’s grip tightened on his weapon, and he felt the medallion’s pull intensify, a magnetic force urging him to call on its power. It throbbed against his chest, a cold, tempting reminder of the power he could wield.

In that moment, Talon hesitated, torn between his fear of the medallion’s influence and the need to protect the others. He could feel Griffin’s judgment, even without looking. He knew that reaching for the medallion would confirm every doubt Griffin held, but as he saw the Eidolons circling closer, he knew he had no choice.

With a shaky breath, he tapped into the medallion’s power, feeling its cold energy surge through him. His vision blurred for a moment, then sharpened, colors and shapes becoming impossibly vivid. He could see the faint outlines of the Eidolons even in the shadows, their movements clearer, as if the medallion had peeled back a layer of darkness.

But as he focused, something went wrong. The power slipped from his control, spiraling out in an uncontrolled burst that threw him backward. A shockwave of dark energy rippled outward, knocking Sari to the ground with a cry. Talon’s heart clenched as he saw her fall, her hand flying to her shoulder where blood was beginning to stain her clothes.

Griffin’s head snapped toward him, fury blazing in his eyes. “What did you do?” he shouted, his voice raw with anger. His gaze darted between Talon and Sari, and in that moment, Talon saw something in Griffin’s eyes—a deep, simmering resentment, as though every suspicion he’d harbored about Talon had just been confirmed.

“I—I didn’t mean to,” Talon stammered, feeling the medallion’s weight like a cold chain around his neck. Guilt twisted inside him, sharper than any weapon, as he saw Sari clutching her shoulder, struggling to sit up. He tried to move toward her, but another Eidolon lunged, forcing him back, its skeletal form blocking his path.

Griffin’s rage shifted to a cold focus as he turned back to the creatures. “Stay close to me, Sari,” he said, his tone fierce, protective. There was a resolve in his voice that Talon hadn’t heard before, as if he were making a silent vow to shield her—perhaps from the Eidolons, or perhaps from Talon himself.

The Eidolons pressed in again, their dark forms a constant threat, but Talon felt frozen, caught between his shame over what he’d done and the relentless pull of the medallion, which seemed to urge him on, hungry for more. He wanted to resist, to push the power back, but every ounce of fear and desperation in him screamed to hold onto it, to channel it, to use it to end this nightmare.

Sari’s voice broke through his turmoil, weak but steady. “Talon… don’t let it control you.” Her gaze, though pained, was clear, and in that brief moment, he saw her faith in him, her belief that he could still master the medallion’s power rather than letting it consume him.

He nodded, swallowing hard, and tightened his grip on his weapon, forcing himself to push the medallion’s pull to the back of his mind. He would not let it define him—not now. Taking a breath, he steadied himself, refocusing on the Eidolons as they closed in once more, a shroud of living darkness.

The Eidolons grew bolder, their purring clicks transforming into low, guttural sounds that reverberated through the forest. They moved with a predatory confidence, sleek bodies gliding in and out of the shadows, each step purposeful. Talon could feel the cold sweat on his brow, the adrenaline in his veins burning through his exhaustion. His mind spun with Sari’s words—don’t let it control you. Yet the medallion pulsed in defiance, an insistent reminder of the dark power within reach.

Griffin’s focus was razor-sharp, his face hard as stone as he swung his sword with calculated force, intercepting each advance with grim precision. He shifted his position to stand protectively in front of Sari, his gaze flickering toward her as she clutched her injured shoulder, her face pale but determined.

“You don’t have to protect me, Griffin,” she managed, though her voice was strained with pain.

Griffin didn’t reply, his attention fixed on the Eidolons as they stalked closer, circling with lethal intent. Talon could see the set of his jaw, the way Griffin’s eyes darkened each time they flicked over to him—a quiet, seething fury that said more than words ever could. Talon knew Griffin was blaming him, that the injury Sari now bore was as much a wound to Griffin’s trust as it was to her flesh.

The forest seemed to darken further, as though reacting to their desperation, the shadows thickening around them until only the faintest traces of light seeped through. Talon tightened his grip on his weapon, aware of the medallion pulsing against his chest, the energy inside it coiling, hungry, beckoning him to unleash it once more.

One of the Eidolons lunged, breaking from the shadows with terrifying speed, its jaws wide in a silent snarl, skeletal limbs stretched forward. Talon sidestepped, thrusting his blade out, and felt a satisfying impact as the creature hissed, retreating with a vicious glare that gleamed in the darkness. But for every Eidolon they pushed back, two more took its place, their relentless persistence wearing on his nerves.

Sari struggled to her feet, her gaze darting between Talon and Griffin, the pain in her eyes tempered by a fierce resolve. “We need to break free,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Staying here… it’s only drawing them closer.”

Griffin nodded, his eyes never leaving the creatures. “We push forward, no matter what,” he said, his tone steel-edged. But then his gaze landed on Talon, and his expression hardened further. “No more mistakes.”

The words stung, a clear warning, and Talon felt a wave of guilt crash over him. But he swallowed it down, focusing on the immediate threat. There was no time for second-guessing. They had to survive this—survive to see another dawn, to keep pushing toward their uncertain goal.

As they moved together, Sari’s shoulder leaning lightly on Griffin for support, Talon took up the rear, his senses heightened, every nerve on edge. The Eidolons fell back slightly, as though testing their resolve, waiting for the right moment to strike again. The low hum and clicks filled the air, a sinister harmony that was both alien and maddeningly hypnotic.

Then, as if in response to some silent command, the Eidolons lunged again, a wave of shadow and teeth. Talon reacted instinctively, moving with a speed he hadn’t realized he possessed, fending off one of the creatures with a well-timed swing. He could feel the medallion’s influence, guiding his movements, sharpening his reflexes, but he held back from fully surrendering to its pull.

Griffin fought beside him, his sword flashing in the faint light, his expression grim but focused. Talon noticed the slight shift in Griffin’s stance—a subtle maneuver to keep himself between Sari and the attacking Eidolons, his protectiveness clear even amidst the chaos.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of clashing blades and flashing shadows, a lull fell over the clearing. The Eidolons retreated a few paces, their eyes gleaming with a cold intelligence, watching the group with calculating precision. They seemed to assess the group, their hunger tempered by an almost eerie patience, as if deciding whether this battle was worth their effort.

The creatures held their ground for a tense moment longer, then slowly began to withdraw into the shadows, their sleek forms fading like smoke into the depths of the forest. The eerie purring sound dissipated, leaving only the rasp of heavy breathing and the faint rustle of leaves.

For a moment, no one spoke. Talon’s chest heaved, his grip loosening on his weapon as he let out a shaky breath. Relief washed over him, but it was mingled with a hollow ache—Sari’s injury, Griffin’s distrust, the dark pull of the medallion that still thrummed against his chest. The silence was nearly as heavy as the battle had been.

Sari broke it, her voice soft but strained. “We… need to keep moving. They’ll be back.” She glanced at Griffin, her expression a mixture of gratitude and pain, before her gaze shifted to Talon, unreadable but tinged with quiet determination. “We can’t let them surround us again.”

Griffin’s response was a clipped nod, though his gaze lingered on Talon with a look that bordered on accusation. “Let’s hope there aren’t more surprises waiting. We’re barely holding together as it is.”

They pressed forward, their steps heavy with exhaustion but fueled by the knowledge that the forest offered no safe haven. Talon kept his eyes on the path ahead, though he could feel the weight of Griffin’s mistrust settling like a stone between them. The medallion’s pulse had slowed, its cold throb a distant, steady beat, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was far from dormant.

As they moved deeper into the forest, Talon felt a strange, gnawing dread. He knew that this battle had only scratched the surface of what lay ahead—that the shadows in these woods were just the beginning of a darkness that ran deeper than any of them could yet understand. And, more troubling still, he couldn’t escape the sense that the greatest danger wasn’t lurking in the forest, but hanging around his own neck, waiting patiently to be unleashed.
