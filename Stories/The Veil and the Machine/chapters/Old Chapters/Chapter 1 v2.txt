Chapter 1: “Into the Depths”

The forest closed in around them, dense and oppressive, the air thick with mist that seemed to seep from the ground itself. It clung to their skin, heavy and damp, muting sounds and softening edges, turning every step into a struggle against the unseen. The medallion rested cold against Talon’s chest, its weight growing with each step, like an anchor dragging him deeper into the earth.

They hadn’t spoken for hours. Griffin took the lead, his shoulders tense, his hand never straying far from the hilt of his sword. Each step he took seemed deliberate, measured, as though he were counting each one, a silent march into the heart of something he couldn’t see but felt pressing in from every side. Sari walked behind them, her gaze sharp, moving between the trees, the shadows, and Talon, her eyes catching every flicker of movement in the corner of her vision.

Talon tried to keep his focus on the ground, on the roots that twisted up from the earth, thick and knotted like ancient veins. But the medallion pulsed in time with his heartbeat, a subtle vibration that seemed to seep into his bones, pulling his attention to the shadows that seemed to breathe with life. The fog thickened, swallowing their path, and with each step, he felt a growing sense of unease.

“Fog’s getting worse,” Griffin muttered, his voice rough and low. “We need to pick up the pace if we’re going to make it through before nightfall.”

Talon didn’t respond. He kept his gaze down, his fingers grazing the edge of the medallion, feeling its chill bite into his skin. The sensation was almost familiar by now, but there was something sharper to it today, a lingering cold that settled into his chest, filling him with a weight he couldn’t shake.

Sari moved up beside him, her steps barely more than a whisper on the damp leaves. “Talon.” Her voice was soft but firm, a quiet anchor in the growing silence. “Are you all right?”

He nodded, though the truth felt tangled in his throat. “The medallion… it feels different. Heavier. Like it’s trying to tell me something.”

Sari’s eyes flickered with a mix of sympathy and something darker, something that Talon couldn’t quite place. “It knows where we’re going,” she murmured, as if speaking to herself. “And it’s preparing you for what’s coming.”

Griffin shot a look over his shoulder, his expression tight, barely containing his irritation. “Whatever the medallion thinks it knows, it better not slow us down. We’re losing light, and I don’t want to be out here when the shadows set in.” He didn’t wait for a reply, his gaze shifting back to the path, his pace quickening as if he could outwalk the unease clawing at them.

Talon felt a flicker of anger but swallowed it back. Griffin’s distrust of the medallion was nothing new, but today it felt sharper, like a splinter that had festered into something deeper. He could feel Griffin’s unease radiating off him in waves, a silent accusation that hung between them, thick and unspoken.

They moved in silence, the fog growing denser, turning the trees into vague shapes, twisted and monstrous in the half-light. Talon felt the medallion pulse harder, an insistent beat that matched the rhythm of his footsteps, a reminder that it was there, watching, waiting.

And then, just ahead, the fog parted slightly, revealing the silhouette of a structure—a cabin, half-hidden in the mist, its outline blurred and broken. The wood was dark, weathered with age, its walls leaning at odd angles, as if it were a living thing caught in mid-collapse. Windows gaped open like empty eye sockets, black and hollow, watching them approach with silent accusation.

Griffin halted, his posture stiffening as he took in the sight. “A cabin. Might be worth checking for supplies, or at least a place to catch our breath.”

Sari’s expression was unreadable, but her voice held a note of caution. “This place… it feels wrong.” She stepped forward, her gaze scanning the structure, her hand resting lightly on the hilt of her blade. “Like something’s waiting inside.”

Talon felt the medallion’s pull intensify, drawing him toward the cabin, as though it recognized something in the darkness beyond those shattered windows. He swallowed, feeling the weight settle deeper into his bones. “I think we’re supposed to go in,” he said, his voice barely a whisper.

Griffin shot him a glare, skepticism laced with irritation. “Of course you do. That thing’s been dragging you along since we started this journey. Just because you feel a pull doesn’t mean it’s leading us somewhere safe.”

Sari looked between them, her face caught between worry and resolve. “We don’t have to stay long. Just enough to see if there’s anything useful. But we keep our guard up.” She stepped forward, her movements controlled and cautious, the fog swirling around her feet like ghostly fingers reaching up from the ground.

They approached the cabin slowly, every step feeling like a descent into something darker, something that didn’t want to be disturbed. The door was half off its hinges, hanging askew, creaking faintly as the wind pushed against it. Talon felt a shiver run down his spine as he reached out, fingers grazing the rough wood. The medallion pulsed, a slow, cold beat that matched his heart, urging him forward.

Inside, the air was stale, thick with the scent of rot and age. Shadows clung to the corners, pooling in dark patches along the floor and walls, as if they were something solid, something waiting. Strange symbols were carved into the wood, twisted lines and jagged shapes that seemed to writhe as he looked at them, shapes that were almost familiar, remnants from his vision, now carved into reality.

Griffin moved past him, his gaze scanning the room with quick, practiced precision. “Whoever was here… they left in a hurry.” His voice was low, cautious, as though he feared disturbing whatever lingered in the walls. He picked up a broken lantern, examining it before setting it down with a frown. “Doesn’t look like they left much behind.”

Sari moved to the other side of the room, her fingers brushing one of the symbols carved into the wall. Her eyes darkened as she traced the lines, her voice a murmur. “These markings… they’re warnings.” She glanced back at Talon, her gaze steady but haunted. “Warnings about something old. Something that shouldn’t be disturbed.”

The medallion’s chill deepened, spreading through his chest, a familiar weight that now felt almost possessive, as though it were binding him to this place, to these symbols. He couldn’t look away, his mind pulled back to the vision, to the dark throne, to the twisted monolith of Metis, towering above a landscape of ruin.

Sari’s voice broke through his thoughts, quiet but insistent. “We should go. Whatever happened here… it wasn’t meant for us to see.”

But Talon hesitated, his fingers grazing the edge of one of the symbols. It felt sharp, colder than the wood around it, as though it carried a piece of the darkness that had seeped into his mind. He could feel it, the pull of the medallion, the weight of the prophecy pressing down on him, binding him to this place, this moment.

Griffin’s voice cut through the silence, laced with impatience. “Talon, whatever you think you’re looking for, it’s not here. We need to keep moving before the fog gets worse.”

But Talon barely heard him, his gaze locked on the symbols, the lines that seemed to shift and pulse, alive with something ancient, something dark. He could feel it, a memory etched into the walls, a whisper of ruin that echoed in his mind, growing louder, more insistent.

He turned to Sari, his voice a rasp. “These symbols… they’re part of the prophecy, aren’t they?”

Sari didn’t answer, her gaze shifting away, a shadow passing over her face. But her silence spoke louder than words, confirming what he already felt in his bones.

They left the cabin in silence, but the weight of it clung to them, a presence that refused to be left behind. As they stepped back into the fog, Talon felt the medallion’s pull intensify, a dark thread connecting him to the shadows, to the symbols, to the prophecy that bound him to a fate he was only beginning to understand.

The fog seemed thicker as they moved away from the cabin, its damp tendrils curling around them, clinging like a second skin. Each breath tasted of wet leaves and decay, the smell of something old and forgotten. Talon felt the medallion’s pull grow more insistent, the chill radiating from it creeping into his bones, seeping into his mind. With each step, the forest seemed to shift, as if it were alive, adjusting itself to watch their progress.

Griffin moved in front, his hand never far from his weapon, his eyes darting from tree to tree, the tension in his shoulders visible even through the dense mist. Sari followed closely, her face set, a flicker of something unreadable in her gaze. Talon walked just behind her, his fingers grazing the edge of the medallion, grounding himself against its insistent pulse.

“Whatever that place was,” Griffin muttered, “it’s better left behind.”

But the cabin lingered in Talon’s mind, the twisted symbols carved into its walls, etched with a purpose he couldn’t shake. The vision had felt sharper there, the prophecy somehow closer, as if the cabin itself had been a part of it—a silent witness to the events that lay ahead. His fingers tightened around the medallion, the cold anchoring him, reminding him of the path that had chosen him long before he understood its weight.

Sari glanced back, her eyes narrowing as they met his. “You’re still thinking about it,” she said, her voice quiet, but there was no accusation in it—only a shared understanding, an unspoken knowledge that she, too, had felt something in that place.

“It felt… connected,” Talon replied, his voice barely more than a whisper. “Like it was part of what we’re looking for.”

Griffin scoffed, his gaze fixed on the path ahead. “And what, exactly, are we looking for? A cabin full of scratches and rot? A prophecy that no one understands?”

The edge in Griffin’s voice made Talon’s stomach twist, a reminder of the growing rift between them. Griffin’s frustration had simmered beneath the surface for days, an unspoken challenge to Talon’s role as the bearer of the medallion, a resentment that had deepened with each passing mile. 

Sari intervened, her tone calm but firm. “The cabin isn’t important, Griffin. The path ahead is. We stay focused, keep moving, and don’t lose sight of what we’re here to do.”

Griffin’s mouth twisted, a flicker of bitterness crossing his face, but he said nothing, his silence carrying a weight that was almost louder than words. Talon could feel the resentment lingering in the air, a tension that pulsed in time with the medallion’s cold beat.

The trees grew denser around them, their branches twisting like skeletal fingers, reaching down as if to close off their path. Shadows clung to the roots, pooling in thick patches along the forest floor, shapes that seemed to shift and ripple at the edge of their vision. Talon’s gaze flicked to one of these shadows, his mind playing tricks on him as it formed shapes—faces, distorted and hollow, like echoes of the dead.

A sudden sharp crack broke the silence. Talon froze, his heart leaping to his throat, his hand instinctively reaching for the medallion. Griffin had stopped, his hand raised in a silent command to stay still. His gaze was fixed on something just ahead, his expression taut, focused.

Sari’s hand drifted to the hilt of her blade, her movements controlled, every muscle tensed and ready. Talon could feel her unease, a silent warning that whatever lay ahead was more than just a trick of the fog. He strained his ears, listening, but the forest was silent, heavy with a watchful stillness that felt almost tangible.

Griffin turned, his voice barely a whisper. “We’re being followed.”

The words sent a chill down Talon’s spine, the medallion’s cold pulse intensifying, as though it recognized the threat, urging him to stay alert. He glanced into the shadows, his eyes scanning the trees, but there was nothing—only darkness, thick and impenetrable, stretching endlessly in every direction.

Sari moved closer, her voice low. “How many?”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “Hard to tell. Could be one, could be more. But they’re close.”

The forest seemed to hold its breath, every sound swallowed by the fog, leaving only the faint rustle of leaves and the distant creak of branches. Talon’s fingers brushed the medallion, the cold anchoring him, sharpening his senses as he strained to listen, to feel the presence that lurked in the shadows.

A flicker of movement caught his eye, a shadow slipping between the trees, too quick and too silent to be human. His pulse quickened, a surge of adrenaline pushing him forward, heightening his awareness. He could feel it now, a subtle pressure at the edges of his mind, as though something were watching him, studying him with a patience that was both unnerving and predatory.

“We need to move,” Sari whispered, her gaze never leaving the shadows. “Slowly, without drawing attention.”

Griffin nodded, his grip tightening on his sword as he resumed his lead, his steps silent and careful. Talon followed, his heart pounding in his chest, every instinct screaming at him to run, but he forced himself to stay calm, to follow Sari’s lead.

The fog seemed to thicken as they moved, pressing in from all sides, the shadows growing darker, deeper, swallowing the light from Sari’s lantern. The shapes at the edge of his vision multiplied, flickering in and out like ghosts, always just beyond reach. He could feel the medallion’s pulse sync with his heartbeat, a cold, steady rhythm that kept him grounded, reminding him of his purpose, of the prophecy that bound him to this path.

But the presence in the shadows grew stronger, more insistent, a silent menace that pressed against his mind, filling his thoughts with a darkness that felt both foreign and familiar. He could feel it pulling at him, drawing him toward the shadows, toward the forest’s depths, as though something within the trees knew him, recognized him.

Sari’s hand brushed his arm, snapping him out of his trance. “Stay close,” she murmured, her voice a lifeline in the suffocating silence. “We’re not alone here.”

He nodded, swallowing hard, forcing himself to focus on her words, on her presence beside him. But the pull of the shadows was relentless, a silent siren call that resonated with the medallion, binding him to the darkness, to the ancient secrets buried within the forest.

Ahead, Griffin stopped abruptly, his posture tense, his eyes fixed on something in the distance. Talon squinted, trying to see through the fog, but the shapes were indistinct, blending into the shadows, merging with the trees.

A faint whisper reached his ears, soft and distant, as though carried on the wind, but he couldn’t make out the words. It was a voice, low and rhythmic, chanting in a language he didn’t understand, a language that felt old and familiar, as if it were carved into his very bones.

He glanced at Sari, who was listening intently, her face set, her eyes narrowed. She seemed to recognize the chant, or at least the feeling it evoked, a shadow of something ancient, something dangerous.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. “Do you feel it?”

He nodded, unable to speak, his fingers tightening around the medallion as the chant grew louder, filling the silence, pressing against his mind like a weight. It was a memory, a fragment of the vision he’d seen, the ruins, the shadows, the dark throne of Metis.

The forest around them seemed to shift, the trees closing in, the shadows thickening, twisting into shapes that bore down on them, heavy with intent. Talon could feel it now, a presence in the darkness, an awareness that was ancient and hungry, watching them, waiting.

Sari’s grip on her blade tightened, her voice a barely contained whisper. “We’re not welcome here.”

They continued in silence, each step slow and deliberate, the shadows pressing closer, the chant reverberating through the fog, filling the forest with a dark, pulsing energy that throbbed in time with the medallion’s cold beat.

And as they walked, Talon felt it—an unspoken threat, a warning buried in the darkness. The prophecy was alive, woven into the fabric of this place, and it was calling to him, binding him to the shadows, to the path that lay ahead.

The fog wrapped around them, thick as wool, muting sound and swallowing light, each step like a plunge into something ancient and unforgiving. Talon could feel the cold of the medallion burrowing deeper into his chest, spreading through his veins, an invasive presence that sharpened his senses and set every nerve on edge. The chant from the shadows had faded, but its echo lingered, a low hum that clung to the air, thick with menace.

Griffin’s pace slowed, his movements cautious, his posture taut as he scanned the trees. Every so often, he would look back, his gaze lingering on Talon, a flicker of mistrust shadowing his eyes. Talon could feel the weight of it, the silent accusation that simmered beneath the surface, an unspoken challenge that had only grown stronger since they’d entered the depths of this forest.

Sari’s hand brushed against Talon’s arm, her touch a quiet reminder of her presence. Her eyes met his, calm but wary, a silent understanding passing between them. She, too, had felt the pull of the shadows, the weight of the prophecy binding them to this path, and he could sense that it unsettled her in ways she didn’t want to admit.

The forest shifted around them, the trees towering overhead like silent sentinels, their branches twisted into unnatural shapes, reaching toward the ground like skeletal fingers. Shadows clung to the roots, shifting and twisting with each step, as though alive, watching, waiting. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, a faint metallic tang that lingered at the back of Talon’s throat.

Griffin stopped suddenly, his hand raised, signaling for silence. He tilted his head, listening, his gaze fixed on a spot deeper in the forest, where the fog hung heavier, almost impenetrable.

“Do you hear that?” he murmured, his voice barely more than a whisper.

Talon strained to listen, his heart pounding in his chest, the medallion’s cold pulse matching its rhythm. At first, there was only silence, the oppressive stillness of the forest pressing down on them. But then, faint and distant, he heard it—a low, rhythmic sound, like a heartbeat, muffled and distorted, emanating from the shadows.

Sari tensed beside him, her fingers curling around the hilt of her blade. “It’s… closer than before,” she whispered, her eyes darting to the shadows, her expression unreadable. “Whatever it is… it’s moving with us.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, his hand resting on his sword. “It’s been following us since the cabin,” he said, his voice laced with frustration. “Whatever we’re dealing with, it’s not just some animal.”

They continued forward, every step feeling heavier, the fog pressing closer, as if the forest itself were drawing them into its depths, guiding them to something hidden, something waiting. Talon could feel the medallion’s pull intensify, a cold, insistent beat that resonated with the faint heartbeat in the shadows, binding him to it, drawing him closer.

As they walked, a strange sensation washed over him—a sense of familiarity, a recognition that he couldn’t place. It was as if he had been here before, as if the forest, the fog, the shadows, were all part of some memory buried deep within him, a memory that the medallion was now awakening.

The path narrowed, twisting between gnarled roots and low-hanging branches, the air thick with mist and the scent of decay. Talon stumbled, his foot catching on a root hidden beneath the fog, and he fell forward, his hand instinctively reaching out to catch himself. His fingers brushed against something cold, smooth, and sharp, buried in the undergrowth.

He froze, his gaze locking onto the object half-hidden beneath the leaves. It was a fragment of stone, carved with the same twisted symbols they’d seen in the cabin, symbols that seemed to pulse with a dark energy, as though alive.

Sari knelt beside him, her gaze fixed on the stone, her face pale. “These symbols… they’re ancient. Older than the cabin, older than the forest.” Her voice was barely a whisper, filled with a reverence that bordered on fear. “They’re part of the prophecy.”

Talon felt the medallion pulse harder, an urgent, insistent beat that matched the rhythm of the faint heartbeat in the shadows. He could feel it drawing him closer, binding him to the symbols, to the dark energy that pulsed beneath the forest floor.

Griffin’s voice broke the silence, sharp and tense. “We need to keep moving. Whatever this is… it’s not going to wait for us to figure it out.”

Sari nodded, but her gaze lingered on the stone, her fingers tracing the symbols with a hesitant reverence, as though she were afraid of what they might reveal. She rose to her feet, casting a final, lingering glance at the stone before following Griffin, her movements cautious, her gaze scanning the shadows.

They continued down the path, the heartbeat growing louder, resonating through the forest, a dark, rhythmic pulse that seemed to echo from all directions, surrounding them, enveloping them in its insistent beat. Talon could feel it pressing down on him, a weight that grew heavier with each step, pulling him deeper into the prophecy, binding him to the path they were on.

The fog thickened, swirling around them, distorting their vision, turning the trees into dark, looming shapes that seemed to shift and move with each step. Talon could feel the medallion’s pull grow stronger, an unrelenting force that burrowed into his mind, filling his thoughts with fragments of the vision—the ruins, the throne, the skeletal figures clawing their way toward a fate they couldn’t escape.

And then, in the distance, he saw it.

Through the fog, barely visible, a faint light glimmered, pale and ghostly, illuminating the trees in a soft, eerie glow. The light flickered, wavering like a distant flame, and he felt an inexplicable pull toward it, a compulsion that defied reason, a need to understand, to see.

Sari noticed it too, her gaze sharpening, her posture tense. “Do you see that?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Griffin nodded, his expression grim. “It’s… leading us somewhere.”

Talon swallowed, his heart pounding, the medallion’s chill settling into his bones. The light felt like a beacon, a call he couldn’t ignore, a promise of answers that lay just beyond the shadows. He could feel the prophecy pressing down on him, binding him to this path, pulling him toward the light with an intensity that was both exhilarating and terrifying.

They moved toward the light, the fog parting slightly, revealing more of the forest, more of the twisted trees and shadows that lurked between them. The heartbeat grew louder, a relentless, rhythmic pulse that matched the medallion’s cold beat, binding him to it, drawing him deeper into the depths of the forest, into the darkness that awaited.

As they neared the source of the light, Talon felt a surge of anticipation, a thrill that bordered on fear. The light flickered, growing brighter, casting long, twisted shadows across the ground, illuminating symbols etched into the trees, symbols that mirrored those in the cabin, in the stone, symbols that seemed to pulse with a dark energy, alive with a memory that refused to die.

Sari stopped, her gaze fixed on the symbols, her expression tense. “These markings… they’re warnings. They’re meant to keep something… contained.”

Griffin’s hand tightened on his sword, his gaze sweeping the shadows. “Then we’re walking into something that was meant to stay buried.”

Talon’s fingers tightened around the medallion, the cold biting into his skin, grounding him against the fear that clawed at him. The prophecy pulsed in his mind, a dark whisper that urged him forward, binding him to the symbols, to the light, to the path that lay before them.

They stepped into the clearing, the pale light illuminating a ring of stones, tall and ancient, each one etched with the same symbols, symbols that pulsed with a dark energy, as though alive. In the center of the ring lay an altar, worn and weathered, stained with dark streaks that could have been age or something far darker.

Talon felt the medallion pulse harder, a cold, relentless beat that matched the heartbeat in the shadows, binding him to the altar, to the symbols, to the prophecy that lay within. He knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that this was a place of power, a place where the boundaries between worlds were thin, where the veil that separated life and death, light and darkness, had been worn down by time and blood.

And as he stood there, the medallion cold against his skin, he felt the prophecy coil around him, a dark, unbreakable chain that bound him to this place, to this path, to a fate he was only beginning to understand.
