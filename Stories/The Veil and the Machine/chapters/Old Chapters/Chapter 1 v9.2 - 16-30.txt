They walked in silence, each of them lost in their own thoughts, the forest closing in tighter with every step. The light filtering through the canopy was thin and pale, casting long, twisted shadows that stretched across the forest floor like skeletal fingers. Talon’s steps slowed as the path grew more treacherous, the ground uneven and littered with roots that seemed to reach up from the earth to trip them.

#### **[P17]**
Sari was the first to stumble, her foot catching on a hidden root. Her neck and shoulder smacked hard against the bark of a tree, bounded off of before catching herself. A small scream escaped from her lungs as she hit the ground off the rebound. Without betraying the pain, she dug her blade into the ground to steady herself, her hand gripping the hilt tightly. “Watch your step,” she warned, but it was too late. She glanced back at Griffin, who muttered a curse as he tripped on the same root and narrowly avoided a collision with her. She limped forward into a walk again, then reached up to wipe the blood off the cut on her neck.

#### **[P18]**
Talon glanced back, catching the brief flicker of frustration on Griffin’s face that was compounded by the near collision with Sari. His face betrayed him before he quickly masked it with a scowl. They were all tired, worn down by days of travel, their supplies dwindling and their patience running thin. The medallion’s pull was the only thing driving Talon forward, and even he was beginning to feel the weight of doubt pressing down on him.

#### **[P19]**
Griffin’s voice broke the silence again, his tone low and edged with frustration. “You still haven’t told us exactly what you saw in that vision, Talon. All we know is that you felt something… calling you here. But what are we supposed to find?”

#### **[P20]**
Talon hesitated, his fingers tightening around the medallion. The vision, although fragmented, was surreal and incredibly vivid. He was home in his bedroom still reeling from his father's death when the vision pulled him in. It felt like it lasted a lifetime, and the world around him was completely lost. There were things that were familiar and things that were ancient. There were clips of structures that were otherworldly and things that were ancient but known. There were flashes of people around a green glow and hollow eyes against a purple sky. He shuddered as he vividly remembered the voice—a voice that felt both familiar and distant, calling his name. Nothing made sense until the moment before he came to; it was his dad, the man he just buried, holding a glowing green medallion—his medallion—out to him like a gesture to pass a generation's responsibility to him. Then, in a moment, his father's face morphed into a man in a giant headdress. His nose was pierced with a straight bar through it, earrings like medallions hanging from his ears. War paint adorned his face, and tattoos of tribal markings covered his face, neck, and arms. He looked battle-worn with scars and fresh cuts on his body, but his face bore the weight of earned wisdom.

#### **[P21]**
He came to lying half off his bed, one leg over the foot of the bed and half his body askew over the side. The vision brought panic like he had never experienced. He rolled over, falling to the floor and retching. He recalled the frantic call to Sari moments after the vision. He lunged up from the ground, still choking from the vomit, and ran for his phone. Her voice on the other end was his lifeline. He panicked and balled, this voice coming in gasps. Her voice on the other end was a lifeline. "Talon, I'm here, and you are safe. Listen to my voice and breathe deep. Are you OK?" she asked as his gasping turned to choking.

#### **[P22]**
“I don’t know,” he choked, his voice barely more than a whisper. He held his breath in vain to calm his nerves. He stammered through parts of the vision and sped through others. Lost to what he was saying, Sari reached into his soul with practiced poise, saying what he needed to hear. "Talon, listen to my voice," she stated again and focused on breathing deep. Moments passed, and his gasps turned to slow breaths. "Something happened..." Talon exclaimed. "Talon, stay on the phone with me. I am on my way."

#### **[P23]**
She drove the five minutes to his house, and they spent all night into early morning pouring over the vision. Then she lay next to him, stroking his hair until he finally fell asleep.

#### **[P24]**
Talon shook his head to get the dazed cobwebs out of his mind, the memory of that night just a few weeks back fading into the real world. It had been some time since Griffin had asked about the vision, assuming that Talon was ignoring him. By the time Talon answered, he simply said, "The vision was... hard to explain. It just gives me a... a feeling, I guess."

#### **[P25]**
Griffin paused, trying to remember the question he asked, then scoffed, his gaze hardening. “That’s it? A feeling? We’re out here, risking our lives, low on food, following a feeling?”

#### **[P26]**
Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s shoulder, her touch grounding him. “It’s more than just a feeling, Griffin,” she said softly, though there was a hint of uncertainty in her own voice. “Talon wouldn’t have led us here if he didn’t believe there was a reason.”

#### **[P27]**
Talon felt the weight of Griffin’s words settle over him, a chain tightening around his mind. Every day removed from the vision brought his resolve down, and each step through these woods made the doubt grow heavier. Doubt wrapped tighter around his chest, restricting his breaths. He wanted to believe in the medallion’s pull, but fear gnawed at the edges of his resolve.

#### **[P28]**
Sari felt it too—his fear, like a tremor reaching across an invisible thread that bound them. She stepped closer, her voice quiet but unshakable. “Talon,” she murmured, “fear is a chain; courage breaks it.” She met his gaze, her expression steady. “Trust what you feel. We’re here because you believe in this path—and I believe in you.”

#### **[P29]**
Griffin shook his head, looking away. “Belief doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. Food does. Shelter does. And right now, we don’t have much of either.”

#### **[P30]**
The weight of his words settled over them, a cold reminder of their dwindling resources and the uncertainty that lay ahead. But Talon couldn’t shake the pull of the medallion, the feeling that they were on the brink of something vast and concealed, just beyond the edge of perception.
