Talon’s vision pulled him into a realm both hauntingly familiar and utterly alien. Silhouettes stretched across a landscape of jagged ruins, their forms distorted and sharp against the murky, oppressive sky. Symbols—ancient, indecipherable—glowed faintly across walls that seemed more like bones than stone, like markers from a civilization lost to time, or something far more disturbing. The symbols flickered, each pulse casting an eerie light that felt alive, pulsating with its own unsettling rhythm.

### Notes:

Introduces a surreal and ominous setting, emphasizing ancient symbols and a foreboding atmosphere tied to Talon’s vision.

He felt drawn to them. Or, rather, something inside him was drawn, pulled deeper toward the center of this shadowed world. His heart beat in sync with the flickering symbols, and his hands tingled as if reaching for something unseen. Talon didn’t want to move forward, but the medallion around his neck pulsed insistently, each throb pulling him deeper. It was like an invisible tether, wrapping around his heart, his mind—binding him to whatever this place was.

### Notes:

Highlights Talon’s connection to the medallion and its influence over him, presenting internal conflict.

There, in the heart of the ruins, a figure waited—a hulking silhouette with eyes as hollow as death itself. It didn’t move. It didn’t need to. Its mere presence radiated a gloomy, cold energy that seeped into Talon’s bones. This figure wasn’t human; it was something vast, something that knew him without ever having met him, and the depth of its knowing sent a chill through his very soul.

### Notes:

Establishes a central antagonist or ominous force that is intricately tied to Talon’s vision and the medallion’s pull.

He tried to turn, to force himself back, but his feet stayed anchored to the spot. The pull was stronger now, almost like a command. The figure’s eyes, empty and depthless, seemed to focus on him alone, and in those eyes, he felt the weight of his own insignificance against whatever power this was. He was nothing—a flicker of light in an endless darkness.

### Notes:

Conveys Talon’s helplessness and the overwhelming power of the antagonist.

As he stared, a pressure built in his head, something clawing its way into his mind, whispering fragments of thoughts and memories that weren’t his own. For a split second, images flashed: a crumbling city, a sea of endless shadows, and the faint echo of a voice he couldn’t understand. Every fiber of his being told him to run, but there was no escape. The medallion was an anchor, chaining him to this place, to this figure. And as the figure seemed to draw closer without moving, Talon’s heart hammered with a dread he couldn’t name.

### Notes:

Builds psychological tension through fragmented visions and the oppressive presence of the medallion.

Talon gasped awake, lungs clawing for air, as if he’d been suffocating under an invisible weight. His hands shook as he instinctively reached for the medallion hanging around his neck. It was cold, almost burning against his chest, and each pulse of it felt like an echo of the vision he’d just escaped. But even here, in the quiet of reality, the vision lingered like a shadow cast on his mind.

### Notes:

Introduces Talon’s waking state and the lingering impact of the vision on his psyche, anchoring the scene in reality.
