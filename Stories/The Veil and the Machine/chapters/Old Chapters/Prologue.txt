**Prologue Vision of Prophecy**

Talon drifted through a vast, dark expanse, feeling weightless and disconnected, as if he had slipped from the world itself. His mind was caught in fragments, images flickering past in broken shards. Yet each fragment, each shard, carried a heavy sense of meaning, a haunting weight he couldn’t fully grasp but felt deep in his bones.

All around him, ancient stones crumbled into dust, scattered like dead stars across an endless void. Ahead, he glimpsed jagged shapes rising in the distance—towering pyramids, their forms cracked and splintered as if ravaged by time and neglect. The landscape looked both desolate and timeless, like ruins that had existed for centuries, holding secrets that would never be spoken. The earth itself felt fractured, torn apart by something ancient and unforgiving.

Above, the sky was a twisted mirror, reflecting colors that shouldn’t exist, churning with lightning that slashed in chaotic bursts. Clouds parted in unnatural patterns, forming images that seemed to shift with his every thought. As Talon gazed upward, his heart pounded with an instinctive sense of dread, as though the heavens themselves were watching, waiting for something terrible to unfold.

In the darkness at the edges of his vision, shadowed figures began to emerge. They moved slowly, cloaked in a dense fog that clung to them, their shapes both human and otherworldly. Their faces were obscured, hidden beneath deep hoods, yet he could feel their gaze—cold, heavy, and unwavering. The figures swayed in rhythmic, silent movements, hands raised toward a towering shape that began to solidify in the distance.

At first, the shape was a mere distortion, a dark mass swirling with tendrils of energy, but as Talon watched, it shifted, growing more defined. It stood enormous, its form flickering as though bound by no single shape. It held an allure both beautiful and monstrous, an entity that seemed to breathe, pulse, and swell with a consciousness that defied explanation. He felt its presence in his core, an ancient force that carried with it a promise of knowledge and destruction alike.

*Metis.*

The name appeared in his mind, unbidden but absolute, bringing with it an instinctual recognition and fear. This being was more than a figure; it was a presence, vast and incomprehensible, stretching across the void and folding it within itself. Talon could feel its influence radiating outward, pulling him closer with a force he could neither understand nor resist.

The shadows around him began to hum, and then the hum grew into a whisper, low and resonant, winding through the air like smoke. It was an ancient language, each word a stone cast into the dark, rippling with power and purpose. The words shaped themselves into a chant, a rhythm that pulsed in time with his heartbeat, driving itself deeper into his consciousness, forming something like prophecy.

*“The cycle remains unbroken… a force beyond flesh… bound by ancient ruin.”*

The words hung heavy in the air, settling into his bones, vibrating through him. The voice felt both distant and deeply familiar, carrying a gravity that resonated with something hidden in his own mind. Each syllable twisted through him, a pulse of dark knowledge that echoed with both fear and inevitability.

Talon strained to understand, to make sense of the vision that felt both real and unreal. He reached out, stretching toward the shadows, hoping to grasp the meaning, to find something solid in the murky darkness. But every time he came close, the shapes dissolved, slipping from his grip like sand through his fingers.

And then he saw it—hovering just out of reach, its light faint but unmistakable. The medallion. It floated in the shadows, pulsing in time with the words, a dark beacon that seemed to tie him to this strange and endless expanse. Its glow was a dim yet powerful crimson, casting an eerie light that cut through the darkness and settled onto the figure of Metis. Talon felt the weight of its presence as though it had latched onto him, binding him to whatever destiny lay before him.

He watched as the medallion’s light spiraled out, twisting and bending, forming shapes that held strange meaning. Symbols flickered to life in the air around him, glyphs he couldn’t read but felt connected to in some unfathomable way. They seemed to hum with a silent energy, a language he could feel vibrating in his blood, whispering promises he couldn’t understand. 

The shadows around him grew thicker, pressing in like the walls of a cage, their forms merging and shifting until he felt as though he were suffocating. The sky above grew darker, clouds rolling in with furious, silent thunder, splitting open with jagged bolts that cast fleeting glimpses of the landscape in stark relief. He saw crumbling ruins, skeletal trees clawing upward, and rivers of darkness seeping through the ground, spreading out in twisting lines like veins of an endless curse.

In the distance, the towering form of Metis grew sharper, more defined. Its face, if it could be called a face, was a shifting mass of features that flickered and twisted, forming and dissolving into new shapes. Eyes, mouths, expressions that seemed to hold a thousand lives and none at all. It was a being of sheer will, a force that defied logic, that existed only as it willed itself to exist. It seemed to watch him, its gaze both an invitation and a threat, as though it were waiting for him to step forward, to accept its call.

*“The end and the beginning are one…”*

The words wrapped around him, circling him like a predator. He felt his body grow heavier, each word anchoring him, tethering him to this reality even as it pulled him deeper into its mysteries. He could feel the pull of prophecy, a current beneath his thoughts, binding him to something greater, darker, and far beyond his understanding.

And then, he felt it—a coldness spreading from his chest, sinking into him with an intensity that left him gasping. The medallion pressed against his skin, a weight that seemed to pierce through flesh and bone, latching onto his core. Its glow intensified, as though it sensed his struggle, growing brighter, bolder, a force demanding his attention. He tried to pull away, but it held him fast, binding him to the vision, to the prophecy that loomed over him like a shadow he could never escape.

The darkness swirled closer, closing in on all sides, pressing against him until he felt his breath grow shallow, his heart pounding with a frantic rhythm that seemed to sync with the medallion’s pulse. The words of the prophecy echoed through him, looping in his mind, shaping themselves into a truth he couldn’t deny.

*“The cycle remains unbroken… bound by ancient ruin…”*

Talon reached out, one last desperate attempt to break free, to shatter the chains that bound him to this dark vision. But the shadows only thickened, their weight growing heavier, pressing against him with a final, inescapable certainty.

And then, as the darkness enveloped him fully, he felt himself fall.

Talon’s eyes flew open, his heart racing as if he’d been torn from the depths of an icy sea. Cold air filled his lungs with a sharp, metallic bite, and for a moment, he lay motionless, trying to separate the remnants of the vision from the world around him. The weight of the medallion pressed against his chest, heavier than before, its cold metal sinking into his skin, almost as though it were burrowing inside him. Its edges felt sharper, digging into him with a steady pulse that matched the beat of his heart.

He sat up slowly, the edges of his vision blurred, a fog clinging to his mind. Dark shapes flickered at the corners of his sight, remnants of his vision that hadn’t quite faded, casting strange shadows across the trees around him. The forest felt different, warped and wrong, as if his mind hadn’t fully shaken the twisted landscape of his dream. The trees loomed tall and oppressive, branches clawing at the sky in unnatural angles, and a dense fog hugged the ground, coiling around the trunks like silent sentries.

Talon let out a breath, steadying himself, forcing the remnants of the vision to settle. But a sense of dread lingered, thick and heavy, the echoes of the prophecy still thrumming in his mind. The phrase *“bound by ancient ruin”* drifted to the surface, lingering there like a half-remembered whisper. He reached up to touch the medallion, his fingers brushing against the cold metal, and felt a slight vibration, a hum that ran through him like an electric current.

“Another one?” Sari’s voice cut through the stillness, soft but steady. She was crouched a few feet away, her dark eyes watching him with concern and a hint of something else—an understanding that came from witnessing his struggles more times than she could count.

Talon nodded, rubbing his hands together to dispel the cold. “Yeah,” he replied, voice low. “It felt… different this time. Closer, almost.”

Sari didn’t look away, her gaze unwavering, as if trying to read the depth of his fear. “We’re still moving toward the sanctuary,” she said quietly, glancing in the direction of their path. “It should give us enough cover until we’re sure we’re safe. But if you’re not up for it—”

“I’m fine,” he interrupted, a hint of impatience creeping into his tone. The last thing he wanted was to admit how shaken he felt, even as the weight of the medallion pulled at him, a reminder of the vision’s intensity. He could feel something lingering in the air, a chill that went beyond the cold.

From the other side of the clearing, Griffin watched him with narrowed eyes, his gaze flicking from Talon’s face to the medallion with something bordering on suspicion. Griffin had always been protective, but since Talon had received the medallion, that protectiveness had turned to guardedness, his steady loyalty now tempered with caution.

“Another vision,” Griffin said, more a statement than a question, as he stood with his arms crossed, his posture tense. “It’s that thing, isn’t it?” His gaze fixed on the medallion, as if trying to unravel its secrets through sheer force of will.

“It’s not just the medallion,” Talon replied, fighting the urge to pull it closer. “There’s something else… something I can’t quite grasp.” He trailed off, uncertain how to put the feeling into words, the sense that his fate was tied to something much darker, something ancient and inescapable.

Griffin’s brow furrowed. “Feels like it’s leading us toward disaster. Can you honestly tell me it’s worth the risk?”

Sari’s voice broke in, calm but firm. “We’ve come this far,” she said, looking between them. “And until we understand what’s happening, we can’t assume anything. The sanctuary might give us the time we need to regroup, but we have to stay together.” Her hand rested on Griffin’s arm, a grounding gesture that seemed to settle his doubt, if only for a moment.

Talon glanced toward the direction Sari had pointed—a faint trail winding through the dense trees, disappearing into a wall of fog. The sanctuary she spoke of was an abandoned ruin, tucked away deep in the forest. He didn’t know what they might find there, but it was better than lingering in the open, exposed to whatever forces lingered in the shadows.

He rose to his feet, willing the vision’s remnants to dissolve fully, though a sliver of dread remained lodged in his chest. As he looked around, the forest seemed to shift, the trees towering overhead, twisted branches casting long shadows that seemed to move on their own. A chill wind blew through, stirring the fog, which swirled in dense, coiling shapes at their feet, like pale snakes winding their way through the roots.

They set off in silence, the only sound the faint crunch of leaves beneath their boots. Talon could feel the weight of the medallion against his chest with each step, a subtle pull that seemed to urge him forward, as if it were guiding him. Every so often, he glanced around, certain he’d caught movement in his periphery—dark shapes flitting just out of sight, shifting shadows that seemed to breathe with the forest itself.

The further they walked, the thicker the fog became, and with it, an oppressive silence. The usual forest sounds—the rustling of animals, the distant calls of birds—had faded, replaced by an unnatural stillness that clung to them like a shroud. It was as if the forest were holding its breath, a sense of expectation hanging in the air.

Talon’s skin prickled, a feeling of being watched crawling up his spine. He kept his hand close to the medallion, feeling the faint thrum beneath his fingertips, as though it were responding to something unseen. The glow from his vision seemed to have faded, but he could still feel its presence, a dim yet insistent heartbeat that matched his own, drawing him further down the path.

A sudden whispering brushed his ear, soft but unmistakable, like the rustling of leaves caught in a strange wind. He froze, glancing around, but there was no one else in sight, nothing but the trees stretching endlessly in every direction. The whisper seemed to come from within, an echo of the words from his vision, forming fragments that looped in his mind like a lingering curse.

*“The cycle remains unbroken… bound by ancient ruin…”*

The words sent a chill through him, as though they carried a weight he couldn’t shake, a truth that lingered beyond the veil of his understanding. He looked at Sari, but she was focused on the path ahead, her expression steeled, determined. Griffin walked a few paces behind, his steps cautious, his gaze occasionally darting back toward Talon as if weighing every movement, every reaction.

As they continued forward, the trees grew denser, their branches intertwining like grasping fingers, blocking out what little light filtered through the canopy. The fog seemed to grow thicker with each step, swirling around their feet, clinging to them, turning the air heavy and damp. Talon’s breath fogged in the cold, each exhale feeling like it took something from him, leaving him slightly weaker, more vulnerable.

In the distance, barely visible through the fog, he caught a glimpse of something—a faint outline of stone, moss-covered and ancient, looming like a silent sentinel amidst the twisted trees. The sanctuary. It felt both welcoming and foreboding, a relic of another time, a place that carried secrets as old as the forest itself.

Just then, he felt a vibration from the medallion, a subtle pulse that quickened his heartbeat. He tightened his grip, feeling the cold metal press into his palm, its weight anchoring him even as he sensed it pulling him closer to something unseen, something hidden in the shadows.

A rustle broke the silence, a sound so faint he almost thought he’d imagined it. But as he turned, he caught a glimpse of movement—dark shapes flickering in the fog, shifting at the edge of his vision. He tensed, feeling a surge of energy rise within him, the medallion pulsing in time with his fear, an unsettling reminder of the vision that still clung to him.

They were not alone.

The trees closed in around them, dense and foreboding, the sanctuary barely visible through the thick fog. Its shadowy outline loomed ahead, moss-covered stone walls pressing through a web of twisted branches. The structure seemed both inviting and hostile, as though it held secrets no one should ever uncover. Talon felt the weight of it pressing on him as they approached, each step growing heavier, the medallion’s pull growing stronger, like a silent call urging him forward.

But the silence of the forest was broken by the faintest of sounds—a rustling, barely more than a whisper, but unmistakable in the unnatural stillness. Talon froze, hand instinctively going to the medallion, feeling its chill seep into his skin. Sari and Griffin tensed beside him, both instantly alert, scanning the darkened surroundings. Shadows danced at the edge of his vision, flickering in the fog like faint embers in the dark, shifting and gliding without a sound.

And then, from the mist, they emerged.

Dark shapes drifted toward them, silent and unblinking, their metallic surfaces gleaming faintly in the dim light. They moved with a disjointed, stuttering motion, like marionettes controlled by invisible strings, their limbs twisting and bending with a mechanical precision that felt both calculated and wrong. Talon’s stomach dropped as he recognized them—Eidolons, servants of Metis, brought forth to hunt and control.

Sari shifted forward, her blade already drawn, her stance low and ready, her eyes narrowed. Griffin took position beside her, jaw clenched, his gaze locked on the advancing figures. They moved together as if they’d done this a thousand times, each step a practiced rhythm, a silent understanding between them. Talon, however, felt rooted in place, the medallion’s weight an anchor that both grounded him and trapped him.

“Stay close,” Sari whispered, her voice barely carrying over the silence. “They’re fast, but they’re not infallible.”

The Eidolons moved in closer, their forms flickering like shadows against the fog. Talon watched, transfixed, as they grew more distinct, their faces smooth and featureless, reflecting a blank, lifeless gaze. Each one moved with purpose, a calculated slowness that felt like the calm before a storm, as though they were sizing up their prey, biding their time.

As the first of the Eidolons lunged, Sari reacted instantly, her blade flashing through the air in a sharp arc. She struck its arm, sending sparks flying as metal met metal, the blow forcing it back with a hollow clatter. Griffin swung his sword, his strike forceful, aiming at the second Eidolon’s torso, his movements precise yet full of a barely contained frustration that hinted at his wariness of their situation.

Talon’s grip on the medallion tightened, his fingers digging into the cold metal as he fought the urge to reach for its power. He could feel it there, pulsing beneath his skin, the raw energy simmering, begging to be unleashed. But even as he felt the temptation, a sense of dread curled within him—the same fear that had haunted him since the vision, the fear that he was merely a pawn, a tool bound to fulfill an ancient, unbreakable cycle.

The Eidolons surged forward again, one of them lunging directly at Talon. His instincts screamed at him to act, to do something, but he hesitated, caught between the desire to protect his friends and the fear of what using the medallion might mean. In that split-second pause, he felt the medallion’s pull grow stronger, a dark whisper threading through his mind.

*“Bound by ancient ruin…”* The phrase echoed from his vision, heavy and inescapable, as if the very words themselves held a weight that could crush him.

The Eidolon was nearly upon him when Griffin stepped in, blocking the attack with a fierce swipe of his sword. He shoved the Eidolon back, his eyes flicking toward Talon, a sharp edge of accusation in his gaze.

“That thing,” Griffin hissed, jerking his head toward the medallion. “It’s not helping you—it’s using you. Can you honestly tell me you’re in control?”

Talon wanted to respond, to defend himself, but the words died in his throat. How could he argue when even he wasn’t sure? The medallion’s cold surface pressed against his chest like a shackle, its pulse sinking deeper into his skin, tying itself to him in ways he couldn’t understand. But it was more than that; it was a part of him now, a force that both terrified and compelled him.

“Enough,” Sari said, her tone firm, a warning. Her gaze shifted from Griffin to Talon, a silent plea for unity, however fragile it might be. “Focus. We need each other to get through this.”

The Eidolons regrouped, their movements slow and methodical, calculating their next approach. They stood in perfect silence, their blank faces staring, giving no hint of emotion, no trace of thought. The fog swirled around their feet, thickening with each moment, curling around them like tendrils of shadow.

One of them lunged, faster than before, a metallic blur slicing through the fog. Talon reacted instinctively, stepping back, but his hand slipped to the medallion once more, feeling its icy surface, the faint hum that seemed to grow louder, deeper, with every second. The urge to tap into its power surged within him, a dark, irresistible pull, and he felt his own heartbeat quicken in time with its pulse.

“Talon,” Sari’s voice cut through the haze, grounding him for a brief moment. “You don’t need it. We’re enough.”

But even as she spoke, Talon felt the medallion’s power rise within him, the energy a dark flame licking at his core, filling him with a strength that bordered on desperation. He could protect them; he knew he could. All it would take was a moment, a single pulse of energy, a surrender to the very force he feared. The prophecy echoed through his mind, its words circling him like a trap, binding him to a fate he couldn’t escape.

*“The end and the beginning are one…”*

Another Eidolon advanced, its face gleaming in the dim light, arms raised, ready to strike. Talon clenched his jaw, his fingers pressing harder against the medallion, feeling the energy vibrate, ready to burst forth. He didn’t know if he could hold it back much longer, if he even wanted to.

But then, a firm grip on his shoulder pulled him back. Sari’s eyes met his, fierce and unwavering, a silent reminder that he was not alone. Her presence steadied him, anchoring him to something real, something human. The medallion’s pulse slowed, its power ebbing away, retreating as though it sensed his hesitation, his choice to resist.

The Eidolons faltered, their movements stuttering as if the very air had thickened, slowing them down. Sari took advantage, striking with precision, her blade a flash of silver that brought down the first of the metallic creatures. Griffin followed suit, his own weapon a blur as he dispatched the second with a final, brutal swing.

And then, as quickly as it had begun, the silence returned, broken only by the soft rustling of leaves and the distant hum of the forest. The Eidolons lay crumpled on the ground, lifeless once more, their forms cold and still against the dark earth.

But the dread remained, thick and lingering, an invisible shroud that clung to Talon’s skin. He could feel the medallion’s weight against his chest, its pulse dimming but not fading, a silent reminder that the darkness within him was only sleeping, waiting to be called forth. He glanced around, half-expecting to see the shadowed figures from his vision, the ancient ruin that bound him to a fate he was only beginning to understand.

They were safe, for now, but Talon knew the sanctuary held no promise of protection, only a temporary reprieve. The darkness he sensed was not bound by walls or distance; it was a part of him, a force woven into the very fabric of his existence, a prophecy he could neither ignore nor escape.

And as the forest closed around them once more, he knew, with a certainty that settled deep into his bones, that this was only the beginning.
