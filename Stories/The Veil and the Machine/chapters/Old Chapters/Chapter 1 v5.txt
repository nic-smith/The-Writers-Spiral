Chapter 1: Into the Unknown

The dense, unyielding forest stretched endlessly before them, each gnarled tree casting shadows that swallowed up the little light filtering through the canopy. Talon led the way, clutching his medallion as if it were a compass, though even he wasn’t sure what direction it pointed in anymore. Each step forward was another foot deeper into the unknown, and for days now, they had walked without much of a destination—just a feeling, a pull he couldn’t shake.

The world they’d left behind seemed like a distant memory. Cities overrun by watchful eyes and technology that seemed to breathe down everyone’s necks. They hadn’t called it “Metis,” but everyone had felt its grip tightening, controlling more with each passing year. Out here, though, technology felt miles away, replaced by an ancient silence that was almost as unsettling as the cities’ unblinking surveillance.

Griffin trudged behind, his face set in a scowl as he swatted away a low-hanging branch. “I still don’t get why we’re here, Talon,” he muttered, pulling a tangled twig from his hair. “What are we even looking for?”

Talon stopped, glancing back with a calm he hoped masked his own doubts. “I told you, I had a vision. Something in here...something we need to find.”

Griffin’s eyes narrowed, flicking to the medallion hanging around Talon’s neck. “A vision,” he repeated, skepticism thick in his voice. “We’ve been out here for days. Whatever that medallion is telling you, it better start being more specific.”

Sari sighed and stepped between them, her expression a blend of patience and empathy. “We agreed to follow Talon’s lead. If he thinks there’s something here, we’ll find it. Let’s just keep moving.” She offered Griffin a smile, lightening the mood even as her own steps seemed slower, heavier.

They walked in silence, but the forest around them was anything but still. Strange sounds echoed through the trees—branches snapping, a distant rustling. The forest felt alive in a way that was both mesmerizing and unnerving. Talon sensed that it held secrets, ones he wasn’t sure he was ready to understand.

Griffin’s grumbling picked up again, low but pointed. “We should’ve packed better. Look at us. We’re filthy, running on scraps...hastily packed food. This wasn’t exactly a well-thought-out plan, you know.”

Talon clenched his jaw, feeling a familiar sting at Griffin’s words. “It’s not like I had time to plan, Griffin. The vision wasn’t clear—it just...it was like something calling me, pulling me here. I couldn’t ignore it.”

“That medallion…” Griffin muttered, casting a wary look at it. “You put so much faith in that thing. And we’re all supposed to follow along blindly because you saw something?”

Sari shot Griffin a warning look. “We’ve all seen strange things since everything started going wrong outside the cities. Talon’s medallion has a history we don’t even fully know. Just...let’s trust him for now, alright?”

Griffin held her gaze for a moment, then looked away with a reluctant nod. Talon felt a surge of gratitude for Sari, but the doubt lingered, like a stone in his gut. Even he didn’t understand the full history of the medallion. It was a family heirloom, yes—but passed down for nineteen generations, its secrets locked in symbols and language almost lost to time. His father had mentioned words like “veil” and “protection,” but even those felt like shadows, ideas with no clear meaning.

---

They walked for hours, the forest closing in on them with every step. The trees grew denser, their roots sprawling across the ground like twisted veins. Their supplies dwindled with each passing meal, and Talon knew they would have to find food soon. The little they had grabbed before leaving felt like it would last forever at the time, but reality was proving otherwise.

At one point, Griffin stopped to inspect the ground, brushing aside leaves and revealing a faint trail of disturbed earth. “Looks like we’re not the first ones here,” he murmured, eyes narrowing. “Animal tracks...and something else, maybe human.”

Talon’s heart quickened, though he didn’t know why. Perhaps it was the medallion, its faint warmth against his chest, as if it were whispering, urging him forward. He caught himself clutching it again, feeling its etched symbols under his fingers, familiar yet unreadable.

Griffin noticed, his jaw clenching. “There it is again. That thing’s got a grip on you. You sure it’s not just leading us in circles?”

Talon bit back a sharp response, glancing at Sari for support. Her gaze softened as she looked between them, and she finally sighed, her voice gentle but firm. “It’s just...one step at a time, right? We trust each other out here. We don’t have anything else.”

Griffin looked away, his frustration simmering just under the surface. But he said nothing, and they continued on, the silence stretching between them, thick with unsaid doubts.

---

Hours later, as twilight crept into the forest, the cabin appeared like an apparition between the trees. Weathered and worn, it stood alone, its dark wood blending into the shadows, almost as if it had been swallowed by the forest. The windows were broken, the door hanging slightly ajar.

Sari was the first to approach, her steps cautious. “Do you think it’s safe?”

Griffin edged in front of her, his shoulders tense. “Safe or not, we could use a break. This rain and mud are wearing us down.”

Talon didn’t hesitate, moving to stand beside Sari as she peered inside. The cabin’s interior was dim, with dust covering every surface, and the stale air was thick, smelling faintly of mold and abandonment. There were remnants of someone’s life here, faded and cracked. An old, rusted lantern sat in one corner, and a half-broken chair leaned against the wall.

“It’ll do for the night,” Talon murmured, feeling a strange sense of relief wash over him.

Griffin grunted in agreement, already checking the corners of the cabin, his cautiousness unyielding. “We can take turns keeping watch. And I’ll see what’s worth salvaging.”

Sari settled down on an old blanket left behind, looking around with a faint smile that seemed both relieved and sad. “Feels like a memory someone left behind.”

Talon nodded, feeling the same sense of nostalgia mixed with an underlying tension. “It’s strange...like this place is waiting for something.”

Griffin turned, the faint glow of his flashlight casting long shadows over his face. “Maybe it’s us it was waiting for. But let’s not get too comfortable. Just because it feels safe doesn’t mean it is.”

The weight of his words settled over them as they unpacked the last of their provisions, eating in silence as darkness fully embraced the forest outside. The cabin was a temporary reprieve, but as the night wore on, each of them felt the call of the unknown lurking just beyond the trees, waiting, as if the forest itself held its breath.

---

As night fully settled over the forest, the small cabin became a fragile bubble of warmth against the encroaching darkness. Talon sat by the dim light of Griffin’s flashlight, holding the medallion in his hands, its cool surface a small comfort as he traced its familiar grooves.

Griffin shifted nearby, leaning against the cabin’s wall with his arms crossed. His eyes were sharp and unblinking, scanning the room as if he expected something to jump from the shadows. “We’re lucky to have found this place,” he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. “But I still don’t like it.”

Sari, seated on the blanket with her back against an old, half-rotten crate, glanced at Griffin with a tired smile. “It’s a roof, at least. Better than another night in the mud.”

Griffin grunted in response, clearly unconvinced. Talon couldn’t help but feel a strange tug of tension between them, like the cabin itself was watching, waiting for something to break the silence.

In the dimness, Talon’s gaze landed on an object sticking out from under a pile of broken furniture, barely visible in the shadowed corner of the cabin. Curious, he crawled over and pulled out a dusty, weather-worn book bound in cracked leather. The initials **“D.H.”** were barely legible on the cover.

“What’s that?” Sari asked, leaning forward with interest.

Talon brushed the dirt off the cover and opened it slowly. Inside were pages filled with scrawled handwriting, the ink faded but still legible. He squinted, the dim light making it difficult to read, but the words he managed to decipher sent a chill down his spine.

“It’s a journal,” he said, his voice low and uncertain. “Looks like...someone was staying here. Someone named D.H.”

Griffin leaned forward, interest momentarily outweighing his usual skepticism. “What does it say?”

Talon scanned the pages, reading aloud in a soft, reverent tone. “‘The shadows move differently here...I feel them even in my sleep. They watch, silent, waiting, as if aware of what I carry. This place was supposed to be hidden, away from prying eyes. But even here, I don’t feel safe. The darkness presses in like a weight, and the thing I once trusted now feels like a curse.’”

He paused, feeling the weight of the words settle over them like a shroud. Griffin’s face was set in a grim expression, and even Sari looked unsettled.

“Do you think it’s about the medallion?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” Talon replied, his gaze drifting to the small, engraved symbols on his medallion. “But it’s strange...he talks about carrying something he once trusted. Something that felt like a curse.”

Griffin scoffed, a hint of bitterness lacing his tone. “Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? I’ve been saying it from the beginning—whatever this is, it’s more than just a family heirloom. It’s dragging us into something none of us understand.”

Talon looked at him, a mixture of frustration and sadness. “You think I don’t know that? I never asked for any of this. The vision...it wasn’t something I could ignore.”

“Maybe not,” Griffin replied, his gaze hard and unyielding. “But dragging us all into it? Trusting some vague vision and a piece of metal? Seems like a lot to gamble.”

Sari shifted, glancing between the two of them. “Come on, this isn’t the time to fight. We’re in this together, remember? Whether we like it or not.” Her words held a gentle firmness, grounding them both. “We agreed to follow Talon, and we’re here now. Let’s make the best of it.”

Griffin huffed but said nothing more, settling back against the wall with a quiet tension that remained just under the surface. Talon offered Sari a small, grateful nod, but he could still feel the weight of Griffin’s mistrust pressing down on him, a reminder of the uncertainty that seemed to hang over them like a storm cloud.

---

The trio settled in, each lost in their own thoughts as the hours stretched on. The journal lay open beside Talon, and he found himself drawn to its pages, his fingers brushing the faded ink as he read silently.

“…The dreams are the worst. Faces I don’t recognize, voices that whisper things I can’t understand. They speak of a Veil, a barrier, a line between worlds. They say it will protect, but now… I’m not so sure. Each day I feel it gnawing at me, like a hunger that can’t be fed.”

He read the words over and over, feeling a strange chill run down his spine. The word *Veil* echoed in his mind, a half-remembered whisper that stirred something deep within him, something he couldn’t fully grasp. The medallion felt heavier in his hands, as if reacting to the word.

“Talon?” Sari’s voice broke through his thoughts, pulling him back to the present.

He looked up, meeting her concerned gaze. She gestured to the medallion, her eyes flicking between it and the journal. “Do you think… maybe there’s more to this than we realize? I mean, if this ‘D.H.’ had something like the medallion, maybe it’s all connected somehow?”

Talon shook his head, the uncertainty gnawing at him. “I don’t know, Sari. I’ve heard stories...whispers about something like a ‘Veil’ from my parents, but they never made much sense. Just fragments, pieces of something that felt...ancient.”

Griffin scoffed, breaking the moment. “Well, ancient or not, it’s not exactly helping us right now, is it? We’re wandering around in the middle of nowhere, guided by something none of us understand.”

Sari gave him a sharp look. “Then why did you come with us, Griffin? If you don’t trust it, why are you here?”

Griffin’s face darkened, his voice tight. “Because I’m not about to leave you two alone in a place like this. Even if I don’t trust *it*,” he glanced at the medallion, “I trust you both. I’m not about to abandon my friends.”

The words hung in the air, and for a brief moment, the tension between them eased. Griffin’s loyalty was as fierce as his skepticism, a steady presence that, despite everything, grounded them. Talon felt a small, grateful warmth settle in his chest, the reminder of their shared bond a comfort in the midst of the unknown.

---

They ate what little food they had left, the stale bread and dried meat a reminder of their dwindling supplies. Griffin, ever practical, had already started checking the cabin’s surroundings, looking for any signs of edible plants or sources of water.

As the night deepened, Talon found himself staring at the medallion, the word *Veil* echoing in his mind. He didn’t know what it meant or why it felt so significant, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that it held answers, a key to something bigger than himself, bigger than all of them.

But with those answers came a sense of dread, a feeling that whatever lay ahead was far from safe, far from anything they could have prepared for. And as he drifted into a restless sleep, the whispers from his vision returned, faint and elusive, like shadows on the edge of his consciousness.

---

Morning came slowly, the pale light filtering through cracks in the cabin’s walls. Talon opened his eyes to the soft creaks of wood settling and the faint rustle of leaves outside, the sounds soothing in their familiarity. He sat up, glancing at Sari and Griffin, who were both still asleep, Griffin slumped against the wall with his arms folded protectively over his chest and Sari curled up on the blanket.

The journal lay next to him, and he picked it up, turning over the pages he’d read the night before. The words felt heavier now, more real in the morning light, and he found himself wondering who “D.H.” really was and what had driven him here. The references to shadows, voices, and something called the Veil lingered, like fragments of a warning he couldn’t fully understand.

After a while, Griffin stirred, stretching his arms and grimacing as he rubbed his stiff neck. He looked around the cabin, his gaze settling on Talon. “You’re up early,” he mumbled, his voice rough with sleep.

“Couldn’t really sleep,” Talon replied, his fingers tracing the worn leather of the journal. “This place… it feels off, doesn’t it?”

Griffin grunted, clearly not needing convincing. “It’s a roof, that’s all that matters. But yeah… there’s something about it. Something... left behind.” He frowned, glancing at the walls as if he could see through them to whatever lay beyond.

Sari woke a few minutes later, blinking at them with bleary eyes and a small smile. “Good morning,” she murmured, pulling the blanket tighter around her shoulders. She noticed the journal in Talon’s hands and nodded toward it. “Did you read more?”

“Some,” Talon replied, opening it to one of the entries he hadn’t read aloud the night before. “But it doesn’t make much sense. Whoever this guy was, he didn’t want to be found.”

Sari leaned over to get a closer look, curiosity sparking in her eyes. “Maybe he came here for the same reason we did,” she said softly, almost as if thinking aloud. “Maybe he was running from something.”

Griffin scoffed, though there was a hint of unease in his expression. “Or he got dragged out here by some ‘vision’ like us and ended up regretting it. Doesn’t sound like it ended well for him, does it?”

Talon felt the familiar sting of Griffin’s doubt but pushed it aside, focusing on the journal. “Look, I know you don’t trust this medallion, but it’s led us somewhere. I don’t know why, and I don’t know what we’re supposed to find, but... I can’t shake the feeling that it’s important.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, Talon thought he’d argue. But then he sighed, glancing away with a resigned expression. “Fine. But if this ‘important’ thing gets us all killed, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Sari nudged him with a faint smile, breaking the tension. “You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t believe in us—even if you don’t trust the medallion.”

Griffin managed a small smirk. “Yeah, well, someone’s gotta keep you two out of trouble.”

---

The day stretched on as they settled into the cabin, each of them taking on tasks to make the place feel less foreign. Griffin checked the area for edible plants or anything useful, his cautious nature driving him to ensure they’d be prepared for the days ahead. Sari sorted through their dwindling supplies, tallying what little food they had left and sharing portions carefully.

Talon stayed in the cabin, studying the journal. The more he read, the more he felt an odd connection to D.H.’s words, as if they were echoes of thoughts he hadn’t yet had. The entries were scattered and fragmented, but one in particular caught his attention.

“*The Veil is both a gift and a curse. It draws, it binds, it watches. I thought I could control it, but now... it feels like it controls me. The shadows move with purpose, whispers I can barely stand to hear. I came here to hide, to find peace. But even here, it follows.*”

Talon’s fingers traced the faint words as he read them, feeling a chill settle over him. The idea of something “following” D.H. resonated in a way that made his skin prickle, as if the forest itself was watching them, waiting for something to change.

When Griffin returned with a small collection of wild berries and edible roots, he glanced at the journal in Talon’s hands and frowned. “You’re still reading that thing? Thought it was just paranoid ramblings.”

“Maybe,” Talon replied quietly, still staring at the page. “But... doesn’t it feel like he was here for a reason? Like he was drawn here, too?”

Griffin scoffed, setting down the berries. “Drawn, maybe. But from what I’m reading, he didn’t exactly find what he was looking for. And I don’t know about you, but ‘shadows moving with purpose’ doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.”

Sari picked up a handful of berries, glancing between them with a thoughtful expression. “Maybe he was just scared. Whatever this ‘Veil’ thing is, it’s probably not what he expected.” She paused, then added, “It’s not what we expected, either.”

The words hung in the air, a quiet reminder of the uncertainty that loomed over them. They each knew they were chasing something undefined, and with each passing hour, the weight of that unknown pressed down on them, filling the cabin with a strange tension.

---

As evening fell, the forest around them seemed to come alive, the sounds of rustling leaves and distant calls echoing through the trees. The cabin felt smaller in the dark, the walls pressing in as shadows crept into every corner.

They took turns watching outside, each of them peering into the forest with a growing sense of unease. Talon’s mind kept drifting back to his vision, to the flashes of darkness and ruin that had driven him to leave everything behind. He hadn’t fully shared the details with Griffin or Sari, unsure of how to explain the pull he’d felt, the strange urgency that had consumed him.

When his turn to watch came, he stepped outside, letting the cold air clear his mind. The medallion felt warm against his chest, a strange contrast to the chill of the night. He clutched it, feeling the familiar weight as he whispered a silent question to the forest, hoping for some sense of guidance.

The forest responded only with silence, a deep, unsettling stillness that made his pulse quicken. He took a deep breath, steadying himself as he looked out into the dark. He knew, somehow, that they hadn’t yet found what they were looking for. This cabin was a rest stop, a brief reprieve, but it wasn’t the end of the journey.

When he went back inside, Sari looked up at him, her eyes filled with quiet understanding. “No sign of anything?”

Talon shook his head, settling back against the wall. “Just... the trees. And silence.”

Griffin, half-asleep, grunted from his spot by the wall. “Silence can be a good thing. Means we’re safe.”

Talon didn’t respond, but he felt the weight of Griffin’s words settle over him. Safe was temporary. The shadows had a way of moving, shifting with purpose, just like D.H. had written in the journal. And as he lay down, closing his eyes against the darkness, he felt a creeping sense of inevitability.

They had found the cabin, yes—but something was still waiting for them, deep within the forest. And the medallion, silent but heavy against his chest, seemed to echo the sentiment, as if calling him onward into the unknown.
