# Prologue: The Veil and the Machine - Markup
[P1]
Talon’s vision pulled him into a realm both hauntingly familiar and utterly alien. Silhouettes stretched across a landscape of jagged ruins, their forms distorted and sharp against the murky, oppressive sky. Symbols—ancient, indecipherable—glowed faintly across walls that seemed more like bones than stone, like markers from a civilization lost to time, or something far more disturbing. The symbols flickered, each pulse casting an eerie light that felt alive, pulsating with its own unsettling rhythm.
[P2]
He felt drawn to them. Or, rather, something inside him was drawn, pulled deeper toward the center of this shadowed world. His heart beat in sync with the flickering symbols, and his hands tingled as if reaching for something unseen. Talon didn’t want to move forward, but the medallion around his neck pulsed insistently, each throb pulling him deeper. It was like an invisible tether, wrapping around his heart, his mind—binding him to whatever this place was.
[P3]
There, in the heart of the ruins, a figure waited—a hulking silhouette with eyes as hollow as death itself. It didn’t move. It didn’t need to. Its mere presence radiated a gloomy, cold energy that seeped into Talon’s bones. This figure wasn’t human; it was something vast, something that knew him without ever having met him, and the depth of its knowing sent a chill through his very soul.
[P4]
He tried to turn, to force himself back, but his feet stayed anchored to the spot. The pull was stronger now, almost like a command. The figure’s eyes, empty and depthless, seemed to focus on him alone, and in those eyes, he felt the weight of his own insignificance against whatever power this was. He was nothing—a flicker of light in an endless darkness.
[P5]
As he stared, a pressure built in his head, something clawing its way into his mind, whispering fragments of thoughts and memories that weren’t his own. For a split second, images flashed: a crumbling city, a sea of endless shadows, and the faint echo of a voice he couldn’t understand. Every fiber of his being told him to run, but there was no escape. The medallion was an anchor, chaining him to this place, to this figure. And as the figure seemed to draw closer without moving, Talon’s heart hammered with a dread he couldn’t name.
[P6]
Suddenly, he felt himself pulled back, tumbling through darkness, and everything vanished.
[P7]
Talon gasped awake, lungs clawing for air, as if he’d been suffocating under an invisible weight. His hands shook as he instinctively reached for the medallion hanging around his neck. It was cold, almost burning against his chest, and each pulse of it felt like an echo of the vision he’d just escaped. But even here, in the quiet of reality, the vision lingered like a shadow cast on his mind.

# Chapter 1: Into the Unknown
[P1]
As the trio ventured deeper into the forest, the trees rose like ancient sentinels, their twisted branches knitting together overhead to form a dense, shadowy canopy. The air thickened with the damp scent of rotting leaves and soil, pressing down on them like a shroud. Talon felt the forest constricting around him, a dark weight settling into his chest. Shadows flickered at the edge of his vision, whispering secrets he couldn’t quite grasp, stirring a deep sense of unease.
[P2]
Griffin’s breaths grew sharper, each exhale laden with irritation. “We’ve been wandering for hours,” he muttered, his voice tight with frustration. “This medallion isn’t leading us anywhere. Are we just walking in circles?” His eyes darted uneasily between the gnarled trees, his skepticism evident in every glance, as if the forest itself were mocking their efforts.
[P3]
Sari walked with focused determination, her gaze flicking between the undergrowth and Talon’s back as she used her twin blades to slice through tangles of vine and thorn. “We need to rest,” she said, casting a glance at her dwindling water supply. “I packed enough for two days, but it’s been nearly four. If we don’t find water soon…” Her voice trailed off, worry lacing her words.
[P4]
Talon clutched the medallion, its cool surface pressing into his palm, grounding him even as doubt gnawed at his resolve. “It’s supposed to guide us,” he murmured, though he felt the weakness in his own voice. His father’s stories of the medallion echoed in his mind, tales of its hidden power to reveal paths no one else could see. Until recently, those tales had felt like folklore, but now they weighed heavily, an inherited burden he couldn’t ignore.
[P5]
Griffin let out a bitter sigh, slicing through the silence. “Supposed to? Talon, we’re just stumbling through this place, chasing a feeling.” His eyes narrowed, irritation shading into something closer to fear. “Your medallion better start showing us something real, or we’re in serious trouble.”
[P6]
The path ahead narrowed, winding as though the forest itself had reshaped to mislead them. Sari cleared a dense patch of vines, her eyes flickering with a hint of doubt. “Maybe we should regroup,” she suggested, her voice calm but edged with caution. “If we don’t find water soon, we’re going to be in worse shape.”
[P7]
Ignoring her, Talon kept moving, clutching the medallion as though it held answers he couldn’t articulate. It was this way, he told himself, though desperation simmered beneath his resolve. He knew how it must look—three young wanderers, lost in an endless maze. But the medallion tugged at him, pulling him forward, deeper into the unknown. “This way,” he said quietly, more to himself than anyone else.
[P8]
They pressed on, each lost in thought as the forest seemed to close in around them, shadows weaving along the path like silent witnesses. The air grew dense, heavy with a humid, electric charge that prickled against their skin—the kind that comes just before a downpour. A low rumble echoed in the distance, rolling through the trees and lingering, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. The sound hinted at a storm building, muted yet relentless, the Earth bracing to wash itself clean. Sari felt a chill creep up the back of her neck as the sound faded, a weight settling on her shoulders. Something was coming, she felt sure of it, but kept the thought to herself, unwilling to add to the unease already thick between them.
[P9]
The medallion was a steady weight against Talon’s chest, cool and constant, as though reminding him of its silent pull. His mind drifted back to his father’s funeral, the moment he first felt its true weight. Until that day, the medallion had been nothing more than a family relic, a trinket tied to stories he hadn’t fully believed. But after his father’s passing, it had come alive, haunting his nights with fractured visions—glimpses of places he couldn’t recognize yet felt within him like buried memories.
**Notes**: Reveals the personal significance of the medallion to Talon and introduces its connection to his visions.
[P10]
He could almost hear his father’s voice, a steady murmur urging him forward, filling him with the sense that he wasn’t alone on this path. His father’s face, half-lost to time, resurfaced in his mind, his expression a blend of fierce determination and sorrow. Talon hadn’t understood it then, but now the medallion’s pull felt like a command—a responsibility too ancient to ignore.
[P11]
A sudden, bone-chilling gust swept through the trees, and Talon’s vision fractured, plunging him back into an echo of the vision that had haunted him since his father’s funeral. He saw glimpses of shadowed structures wreathed in green mist, hollow eyes staring down from a sky tinged with a strange, unnatural purple. His father’s face appeared amid the chaos, eyes full of sorrow and warning as he clutched the medallion with a desperation Talon hadn’t understood. Talon reached out, heart pounding, but his father’s face twisted, morphing into that of a fierce, battle-scarred warrior, his skin etched with markings, his gaze blazing with ancient resolve.
[P12]
Talon’s grip on the medallion tightened, grounding himself against the weight of the vision. The fractured images dissipated, but a prickle of unease lingered. He had seen this before—on the day of his father’s funeral, when the medallion had first called to him. The feeling it left behind was the same: an urgency he couldn’t shake, a pull into the unknown.
[P13]
Sari glanced back, catching his hesitation. “You okay?” she asked quietly.
[P14]
Talon forced a nod, though his mind lingered on the vision. He knew it was just a fragment—a reminder of what had set all of this into motion, the strange, elusive purpose pulling him forward. Whatever they were moving toward, it felt far more profound than a trek through the woods. He shook his head, the medallion’s weight growing heavier, its pulse pressing against his chest like a heartbeat out of sync. “I don’t know what any of this means,” he murmured, the words almost to himself, trying to give shape to the gnawing feeling inside. “But… we’re close. It’s like something’s been waiting, drawing us in.”
[P15]
The humidity thickened, carrying a faint metallic tang—a warning of rain. A sudden gust rattled the branches above, and a chill seeped into Talon’s bones, drawing an involuntary shiver. He glanced up, catching a flicker of shadow moving through the canopy, an ominous darkness that seemed to watch, hovering just out of sight.
[P16]
Before Talon could say more, Sari’s foot caught on a hidden root, pitching her forward. She collided with a tree, bark scraping against her shoulder. She hissed, pressing a hand to the fresh cut, where blood was already beginning to bead. “Watch it!” she snapped, her voice tight with pain. Griffin stepped forward to steady her, his gaze flicking to Talon with a flash of frustration. “Damn it, Talon!” he spat, anger simmering beneath his words. “If this medallion of yours is just a wild goose chase…” He stopped, his words hanging in the air like a threat. “This isn’t a journey—it’s a death march.”
[P17]
Talon stepped aside, casting a glance at the forest pressing in around them, then back to Sari’s fresh wound. A faint, reassuring smile played on his lips. “Stick with me,” he whispered a plea, his voice steady but soft. “I know this is crazy, but if we turn back now, all we’ll have are shadows and what-ifs. They say the only way out is through.” His words held a quiet weight, catching Sari’s attention as her gaze softened. Griffin only sighed, rolling his eyes, but the truth of it settled over them all. Whatever lay ahead, Talon knew, was waiting just beyond—hidden, but within reach.
[P18]
Sari placed a gentle hand on Talon’s shoulder, her expression soft yet resolute. “Talon, you wouldn’t have brought us here without a reason,” she said, though there was a hint of uncertainty, as if she were trying to convince herself as much as him. Her hand lingered, a silent reminder of the trust she’d placed in him.
[P19]
Griffin’s words lingered like a shadow over Talon, a weight pressing down on his resolve. Each day in the forest had chipped away at his confidence, every tangled step eroding the certainty he’d felt since that first vision. He wanted to believe in the medallion’s pull, but with each passing hour, doubt gnawed a little deeper.
[P20]
Sari sensed his unease and stepped closer, her voice a whisper just for him. “Talon, courage and fear… they walk the same path,” she murmured. “Trust what you feel. We’re here because you believe in this journey—and I believe in you.” Her gaze held his, grounding him in a quiet steadiness he desperately needed.
[P21]
Griffin shook his head, looking away. “Belief doesn’t keep us alive, Sari. Food does. Shelter does. And right now, we’re running low on both.” His words were a cold reminder of the reality pressing down on them, the practical dangers overshadowing the mysteries they were chasing.
[P22]
The silence thickened, the weight of Griffin’s doubts hanging over them. Talon felt the medallion pulse against his chest, a steady beat urging him forward even as uncertainty gnawed at his thoughts. He forced himself to push the doubts aside, to trust in the pull that had brought them this far.
[P23]
They trudged on, the forest growing darker as the light continued to fade. Shadows stretched across the ground, merging into the trees as though the forest itself were alive, watching them with unseen eyes. Talon’s steps quickened, his heart racing in time with the medallion’s pull, which seemed to grow more insistent with each passing moment.
[P24]
“We need to make camp soon,” Griffin said, his voice flat with exhaustion. “We’re low on everything, and we’re not going to last much longer at this pace.” Talon heard the weariness in Griffin’s tone, the frustration replaced by fatigue, and he couldn’t ignore the toll the journey had taken on all of them.
[P25]
“Feels like the air’s thick enough to bring rain, doesn’t it?” She glanced around, barely able to see the sky through the thick canopy but still feeling the damp weight of it pressing down.
[P26]
Another low rumble echoed, rolling through the trees, louder this time, pressing against them from all directions. The sound wasn’t just thunder—it felt like the forest itself was groaning, straining under some unseen weight. The three paused, glancing up as the darkening sky flickered with distant lightning, casting the forest in brief, eerie flashes.
[P27]
As the sun dipped lower, shadows pooled around them, merging into an unbroken wall of darkness. Talon was about to agree they should make camp when he saw it—a shape looming through the twisted branches and thick undergrowth. It was dark and hulking, half-hidden but unmistakable. His heart quickened, doubts and exhaustion momentarily forgotten. “There,” he whispered, moving toward it, forcing Sari and Griffin to follow.
[P28]
As they drew closer, the shape solidified into a rundown cabin, leaning under the weight of creeping vines and age-worn wood. The roof sagged, and the warped walls seemed ready to collapse, as if burdened by years of neglect. Relief mingled with unease in Talon’s chest; the cabin felt unnatural, an interruption in the endless forest, waiting in silence for something—or someone.
[P29]
Sari caught up, her eyes widening with a mix of relief and wariness. “Is that...?” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, as if speaking louder might make the vision vanish. The cabin stood as if watching them, its darkened windows like hollow eyes reflecting the fading light.
[P30]
Griffin’s gaze swept the area around the cabin, lingering on its warped exterior. “Could be a trap,” he muttered, his hand tightening around the hilt of his knife. A damp gust stirred the stagnant air, carrying a faint, metallic tang that prickled his skin, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. He glanced up through the thinning canopy, catching sight of dark clouds gathering low—a promise of rain and something darker hovering just beyond reach.
[P31]
Another crack of thunder, louder this time, rumbled through the forest, vibrating in the ground beneath them. The air turned colder, and scattered raindrops began to slip through the thick branches above, spattering against leaves and shoulders. The light dimmed as clouds gathered overhead, smothering the last traces of daylight. Sari exchanged a look with Talon, both feeling the storm’s encroaching threat—a force neither could ignore.
**Notes**: Intensifies the approaching storm’s influence, heightening the sense of urgency and foreboding.
[P32]
But Talon felt something different. As he stared at the cabin, a strange sense of familiarity washed over him, as though he had been here before—though he knew that was impossible. The medallion at his chest pulsed, its rhythm matching his heartbeat. This place held something for them, something hidden, something waiting just beyond their sight.
[P33]
They stepped closer, each of them feeling the weight of the forest lift slightly, as if the cabin itself offered a reprieve from the oppressive shadows. The air around it was heavy, unsettlingly calm, and Talon’s skin prickled under the sensation of being watched, an invisible gaze tracking their every movement.
[P34]
The forest finally gave way, opening into a small clearing, and for the first time, they could see the sky. Dark clouds gathered low, their edges bruised and heavy with an incoming storm. Sari’s unease solidified, but the promise of shelter kept her silent.
[P35]
Griffin looked back at Talon, skepticism flickering with a faint, reluctant hope. “So, is this where the medallion’s been dragging us?” His voice was edged with bitterness, softened only by the fatigue etched into his face, as though even his frustration had grown weary.
[P36]
Talon nodded slowly, feeling the medallion’s pull stronger than ever, urging him forward. He could see the strain in his friends’ faces—the doubts, the fear, and the exhaustion. “I don’t know what we’ll find,” he admitted, his voice steady but quiet. “But we didn’t come this far to turn back now.”

# Chapter 2: Shelter and Secrets
[P1]
Outside, the forest pulsed with the storm’s lingering energy, heavy raindrops bouncing off leaves and pooling into fast-moving streams that cut fresh paths through the underbrush. The air was thick, charged with the scent of wet earth and the restless sway of trees caught in the gusts. Inside the cabin, though, the world felt suspended in time. The air was stale, carrying faint traces of decay. Dust floated in thin, jagged beams of fractured light slipping through cracks, illuminating uneven patches across the dim room. Shadows leapt along the walls as tree branches interrupted what little light there was. Talon took a cautious step forward, feeling the silence settle over him like a weight as his gaze swept over the sparse, abandoned remnants of a life long forgotten—so different from the raw, relentless energy they’d left behind in the forest. Sari clicked on the flashlight she’d pulled from her pack, casting a sharp beam across the shadows as the three glanced around.
[P2]
The cabin was a single room, sparsely furnished with a small bed, a wobbly table, and a few shelves, all blanketed in a layer of dust. A narrow, grimy window looked out over the dense forest, filtering in only faint light. Off to one side, Talon noticed a doorframe leading to a cramped closet—no plumbing, no conveniences, just the barest essentials. Outside, barely visible through the window, stood a crooked outhouse leaning to one side—a testament to the cabin’s age and isolation. A warped wooden table sat at the room’s center, surrounded by mismatched chairs that looked one shove away from collapse. Against the far wall, a stone fireplace held a scattering of cold, gray ashes, untouched for what seemed like years. The silence hung thickly around them, as if the cabin itself resisted their presence, unwilling to surrender its secrets.
[P3]
Sari swept her flashlight from corner to corner, casting thin, shaky beams along the walls. “Whoever stayed here left in a hurry—or planned to come back,” she murmured. She wandered to a dusty corner, her hand brushing against something soft and worn. Lifting a faded, threadbare blanket, she gave it a quick shake, sending a cloud of dust into the air. She draped the blanket over a chair, her gaze lingering on it a moment, as if sensing an echo of the lives that once filled the cabin, before moving on.
[P4]
Griffin cast a wary glance around, his shoulders tense. “Feels like we’re intruding,” he muttered. Moving to the window, he peered out at the rain-streaked glass, watching the downpour that sealed them in.
[P5]
Sari moved past him, running her fingers over the cracked surface of the table, leaving a trail in the dust. “Whoever lived here didn’t leave much behind,” she murmured, her voice barely more than a whisper, as if afraid to disturb whatever lingered in the cabin’s corners.
[P6]
“Better in here than out there,” Talon replied, his voice lacking conviction. He pulled his pack off his shoulders and dropped it with a thud on the table. The weight of their journey pressed down on him, each step in the forest draining his energy and resolve.
[P7]
Sari eased into one of the rickety chairs, glancing toward the cracked window where rain hammered against the glass, streaming down in thick rivulets. “Feels like this storm’s trying to get in,” she muttered under her breath, pressing a hand to the wall as the cabin groaned with each gust. Water pooled near the door, and a damp chill seeped in through every gap, clinging to their clothes and skin. After a beat, she nodded toward their packs. “We should check what we’ve got left. If we’re waiting this out, we need to see what we’re working with.”
[P8]
Griffin rolled his eyes but followed suit, unshouldering his pack and dropping it on the table beside Talon’s. “Fine. Let’s take inventory.” He opened his pack, pulling out the last of their provisions—a handful of trail mix, a couple of protein bars, and a nearly empty camel pack.
[P9]
“Our phones are dead, and they’d be useless here anyway,” Griffin muttered, setting his dead phone on the table. “No signal this deep in the forest.” He gave a dry smile, glancing at the faded map in Talon’s pack. “And that map? Pretty much worthless with no landmarks to go by.”
[P10]
Talon stared at the sparse collection on the table, an unease creeping into his thoughts. They had enough food for a few days if they rationed carefully. The medallion felt heavier than ever, its weight against his chest a constant reminder of their purpose. The reality of their situation was settling in: they were running out of time and options.
[P11]
Sari added her water bottle and a small flashlight to the collection. She clicked the flashlight on and off, testing its dim beam. “Not the supplies for a long stay, but we’ll manage,” she said, her voice steady despite the worry underneath.
[P12]
The storm outside raged on, the relentless rain hammering against the cabin, each gust of wind causing the walls to groan in protest. Griffin leaned back, crossing his arms as he studied their meager rations. “So, Talon, what now? Are we just supposed to sit here and hope this thing,” he gestured at the medallion around Talon’s neck, “decides to give us directions?”
[P13]
Talon looked down at the medallion, feeling its subtle pull even in the shelter of the cabin. “I don’t know. But I feel like we’re close to something…something important. This place, this storm, everything about it feels like it’s pushing us in the right direction—or at least keeping us here for a reason.”
[P14]
Griffin let out a frustrated breath, running a hand through his hair. “We’re in the middle of nowhere with barely enough food to last. And we’re just supposed to rely on your feeling?” His tone held a mix of doubt and something else—a hint of fear creeping through his skepticism.
[P15]
Sari reached out, resting a hand on Talon’s shoulder, her touch a quiet reassurance. “We trusted you enough to get this far, Talon. If this is where the medallion is guiding us, we’re in it together.” Her voice was calm, a steadying force against the rising tension.
[P16]
A flash of lightning illuminated the room, casting stark shadows across their faces. The storm showed no signs of letting up, trapping them within the cabin walls, a reminder that they were far from any help. The weight of isolation settled over them, thick and oppressive.
[P17]
Griffin moved to one of the windows, peering out at the darkened forest beyond the rain-streaked glass. “We’re sitting ducks here. If that thing isn’t going to help us find what we’re after, we’re just wasting time.” His voice carried a bitterness that seemed to echo within the cabin, intensifying the silence that followed.
[P18]
Talon took a deep breath, feeling the medallion press into his chest, as though grounding him. “It’s led us this far. I think we need to trust it…even if it doesn’t make sense.” He spoke more to himself than the others, a quiet affirmation that he couldn’t fully believe but couldn’t dismiss.
[P19]
The rain pounded against the roof, filling the silence with its relentless rhythm. The cabin seemed to close in around them, shadows stretching into the corners with each flash of lightning. In the dim light, each of them was lost in their own thoughts, weighed down by the enormity of the unknown.
[P20]
Sari shifted in her seat, pulling the worn blanket tighter around her shoulders. “We’ve gotten this far. Let’s just rest and wait for the storm to pass. We’ll need our energy for whatever’s next.” She offered a faint smile, attempting to pierce the tension.
[P21]
Griffin snorted but didn’t argue. He slumped into a chair, his shoulders sagging, a look of resignation settling over him. “I just hope that medallion knows what it’s doing.”
[P22]
The storm outside continued to rage, the relentless sound of rain and wind pressing against the cabin walls. But inside, a heavy silence settled over them, an almost suffocating stillness that seemed to magnify their isolation.
[P23]
Sari placed the flashlight down on the table, its beam casting a soft arc across a part of the cabin they hadn’t yet explored. Restlessly, Talon moved toward the edge of the light, his gaze settling on a low shelf partially hidden behind the bed and a small, rickety end table. He knelt, brushing aside dusty trinkets and scraps of paper. As he shifted, his foot pressed down unevenly on something beneath the bed.
[P24]
Curious, he reached under the bed and drew out a small, weathered journal, its leather cover cracked and softened by time. Dust rose in a faint cloud as he brushed it off, revealing faint initials—D.H.—embroidered in the center of the scratched cover. The journal felt dense in his hands, almost heavy with secrets, as if it had been waiting in silence for someone to unearth its stories. Talon turned it over slowly, sensing the weight of untold histories bound within its worn pages.
[P25]
Griffin looked up, curiosity cutting through his irritation. “What’s that?” he asked, his voice tinged with suspicion.
[P26]
“A journal, I think,” Talon replied, wiping away a layer of grime from the cover. He opened it, flipping through pages filled with cramped, uneven handwriting. “It’s like someone documented… their time here. Whoever lived here before us.”
[P27]
Sari leaned in, her gaze locked on the faded ink. “Read something,” she urged, her voice soft but insistent.
[P28]
Talon flipped to a random page in the journal, noting the hurried, uneven handwriting. “Daniel’s theories grow wilder by the day. He talks of power, of history’s secrets hidden within this artifact, as if it were alive.” Talon frowned, skipping ahead a few pages. “If I’m honest, part of me fears he’s right. The Veil piece… its presence feels heavier each day.”
[P29]
Skipping forward, Talon found a passage thick with frustration and fear. “It’s changed him. He stares at the Veil piece as if it were a lover. There’s a darkness in his eyes now—one I can’t understand. I told him we should return it. He laughed… as if I were a fool.” Talon looked up at Sari and Griffin, his voice barely a whisper. “I think Dominic tried to stop him.”
[P30]
A chill settled over them, and even Griffin seemed unnerved, his earlier doubt giving way to a wary silence. “Sounds like they were losing it,” he muttered, though his voice lacked conviction.
[P31]
Talon turned to another entry, his expression darkening as he read. “The Veil is thin here, and it’s getting harder to tell what’s real. They say it’s just an old legend, but… I’ve seen things. Shadows that don’t belong.” He paused, feeling a prickle of unease, as though the journal’s words were reaching out from the past to touch him.
[P32]
Sari’s face had gone pale, her fingers clutching the edge of the table. “The Veil? You think that’s what’s pulling us here?”
[P33]
Talon shrugged, closing the journal but keeping it within reach. “Maybe. Whatever it is, this place has history—and not the kind you find in books.” He looked around, feeling the medallion’s weight against his chest, its pulse almost syncing with his own heartbeat.
[P34]
The group fell silent, each of them absorbing the implications of what they’d heard. The rain outside had softened to a steady patter, but the sense of foreboding remained, filling the gaps between each breath.
[P35]
A heavy silence settled between them to mirror the fading storm, the weight of the journal’s revelations keeping their thoughts tethered and their tongues still. They lingered in that uneasy quiet until Sari reached for the flashlight and clicked it off, plunging the cabin into darkness. Exhaustion pressed into the corner of their eyes, and one by one, they slumped into uneasy sleep. Sari curled up into a ball on the floor, looking more fragile than she was. Griffin leaned against the wall, his chin tucked into his shoulder. Talon lay back on his elbow, his other hand resting on the spine of the journal. Sleep should have come easily, but none of them found true rest.

# Chapter 3: Into that Dark Night
## Sari
[P1]
I can’t sleep. This floor feels like it’s been chiseled from stone, every shift sending a fresh stab of discomfort into my aching body. The air is damp, cold, and thick with a musty staleness that feels ancient, like it belongs to a place long forgotten by life itself. Everything here is filthy, suffocatingly wrong. This whole thing… it’s so wrong. How did we let it come to this?
[P2]
I didn’t expect to be here—not last week, not ever. When Talon told me about the vision and the medallion, it sounded insane. But he caught me at just the right moment—mid-fantasy of burning my painfully bland, meticulously curated princess life to the ground and twirling through the ashes like a deranged pyromaniac ballerina. I don't know if it was the pain and fear in his eyes, or my own desperate need to escape the suffocating expectations of my family’s predestined prison, but either way, I said yes. I thought it would be a short escape—a few hours hiking through overgrown trails, a little fun, a little adventure.
[P3]
Talon, my Talon, sits hunched over by the lifeless fireplace, his hands clasped tightly enough to make his knuckles pale. Even in sleep, the weight of everything seems to press on him, etching worry into his posture. The medallion’s burden isn’t just something he carries—it’s inside him, winding tighter with every passing day, pulling all of us into its spiraling madness. I’ve thought about turning back more times than I care to admit, about dragging Griffin and his incessant complaints with me. But something always stops me. Maybe it’s the way Talon looks at the world—that haunted, faraway gaze that seems to hold truths too vast and terrible for the rest of us to comprehend. Or maybe it’s just me, desperate to believe in something—anything—that feels bigger than my suffocatingly small life.
[P4]
And then there’s Griffin. Or as I’ve started calling him in my head, ‘Knightmare.’ He hasn’t stopped grumbling since the moment we set foot in the forest, but of course, he’s still here. For all his maddening theatrics, there’s something steady in him—a raw instinct that feels like he’d throw himself into the fire to keep us safe, even if he complained the whole way. Swinging that ridiculous sword around like we’re in some medieval drama and he’s the star—clumsy, dirty, and absolutely infuriating. Honestly, it’s a miracle he hasn’t chopped his own leg off yet. He’s maddening. He’s ridiculous. And God help me, he’s… sexy, in a way I’d never admit out loud. It’s not like the steady warmth I feel with Talon—the kind that’s been there for years. No, this is sharper, hotter, dangerous, and forbidden. Tangled up with something I can’t quite name.
[P5]
This cabin is disgusting. Sure, I’m glad to be indoors and out of the rain, but calling it shelter feels generous. The floorboards creak under every step, dust coats every surface, and the air reeks of decay. But it’s got a strange, unsettling character, like it’s hiding secrets just out of reach. It feels like part of the tangled mystery we’ve stumbled into. And then there’s the journal—an unassuming little thing that feels oddly monumental. Half the time it reads like the unhinged ramblings of a lunatic, but I can’t tell if it’s a warning, a clue, or simply chaos given form. There’s a pull to it I can’t quite explain. Maybe it’s the way the words on the pages echo Talon’s haunted look or how they make this whole ordeal feel like a thread I need to unravel. The look in Talon’s eyes as he reads the pages aloud... the way they dart, almost frantic, the way his voice trembles like he’s holding something back. The tears that gather at the edges but refuse to fall. It wasn't by accident we found it. The journal calls to me, whispering secrets I don’t yet understand. It feels like a thread that, if pulled, might unravel everything—or maybe tie it all together. It’s as if it’s waiting for me, destined to be part of this chaos we’re caught in. But the weight of survival presses harder. Food, water, not dying—that has to come first. The madness can wait.
[P6]
Everything inside me loves this. The mystery. The danger. It’s like nothing I’ve ever felt before. I’ve spent my whole life doing what I was supposed to do, living up to expectations. But this… this is different. Out here, in the middle of nowhere, with two boys who couldn’t be more opposite, chasing something that might not even exist? It’s freedom. It’s fun. It’s terrifying. I just wish there was an outhouse.
## Talon
[P7]
Sleep doesn’t come for me anymore. Not really. I lie down, close my eyes, but rest never follows. My body feels like it’s betraying me, stiff and aching from days of this relentless journey. The medallion whispers like a second heartbeat, thrumming in my chest, its pull as constant and unrelenting as gravity. Now this journal. Now this perfect spiral into madness written in a phantasmagoria daze. I can feel the Veil draw on my soul as I pour through its pages. Each word feels alive, tugging at the fragile threads of my sanity. The medallion led us here. I wish I could forget... forget... forget. It wants me to move, to keep going, even now while the others are asleep. Especially now. The darkness outside presses against the cabin walls, its weight mirroring the storm in my chest. Rest feels like a distant, unattainable luxury, one I can’t afford even if I wanted to. The medallion is both my tormentor and my guide—the reason I am awake and the reason I will never truly sleep again.
[P8]
Griffin is sprawled out near the far wall, his snoring filling the cabin like a low, ceaseless grumble. Even in sleep, he manages to irritate me. I love him, but his endless complaining cuts me leaving wounds that bleed. He’s not wrong—this place is madness wrapped in misery—but his constant negativity gnaws at what little resolve I have left. The guilt pooling in my gut churns, threatening to spill over, and his attitude makes it harder to keep myself from unraveling completely. His sleeping bag is twisted around him, a cocoon of warmth that seems to mock my restlessness. I envy his ability to shut it all out, even for a moment, and resent it in equal measure. His breaths rise and fall steadily, a rhythm that grates against my own chaos, a cruel reminder of how detached he can be from the weight pressing on me.
[P9]
Sari... She’s tucked into her sleeping bag near the fireless hearth, her silhouette barely visible in the faint light that filters through the cabin’s cracks. Her face is calm, beautifully peaceful, like a fleeting memory of a time untouched by this madness. She’s not just my anchor—she’s everything. My driving force. The one steady point in a world that feels like it’s crumbling around me. She isn’t just my friend; she’s my purpose, the reason I haven’t given in to the pull of the medallion entirely. And yet, I feel guilt, sharp and unrelenting, because I’m dragging her into something she doesn’t deserve. Reluctant, dark envy creeps in, though I know it’s ridiculous. Her strength, her intellect—it feels almost unfair how effortlessly she embodies those qualities. Her beauty, too, is unmatched, a quiet radiance that draws people to her without her even trying. I know deep down that if we hadn’t met at that summer camp all those years ago, she would’ve never had a reason to be my friend. She’s the one who should be leading us. It’s her. The way she seems untouched by the storm raging both inside and outside only deepens my self-loathing. How can someone so vital, so centered, remain tethered to someone as fractured as me? The medallion didn’t choose her—it chose me—but perhaps it got it wrong. Or maybe the Veil needs someone broken to do its bidding. But she doesn’t feel the pull. The medallion chose me, for reasons I’ll never understand, and it refuses to let go, even in the moments I wish it would.
[P10]
The cabin feels like a tomb, the air pressing down on me with a weight that claws at my chest. Every creak of the damp wood whispers a reminder of how fragile this place is, how fragile we are. The storm outside has returned with a vengeance, the wind howling like a beast circling its prey. Branches claw at the windows, and the sound of rain drumming on the roof merges with the groan of the old beams. It’s relentless, like the medallion’s pull. But I can’t focus on it, not really. I can’t let myself. If I let it in—if I let the thought settle in my mind—I’ll shatter. And shattering isn’t an option. Not now. Not ever. The wind seems alive, the draft through the cracks brushing against my face like unseen fingers. Somewhere deep in the storm’s chaos, I can hear whispers—not words, but emotions, desperate and hollow.
[P11]
The journal reposes on the floor by my head. It landed there when I fell asleep—if I even slept. Closed tightly as if to trap its secrets. I’ve read those pages so many times I don’t need to look at them; they’re burned into my memory. But even now, in the silence, the vision crawls back into my mind, as vivid and unrelenting as the medallion’s pull. My stomach tightens, and the air in the cabin feels thinner, harder to pull into my lungs. It’s the reason I’m here, dragging Sari and Griffin into this. The words etched into the yellowed pages echo in my mind like a chant, looping endlessly. Each line feels like a thread pulling me deeper into something I don’t understand, something I might never escape. The edges of the journal are frayed, as though it resists its own existence, as if Dominic himself tried to erase its burden and failed.
[P12]
I saw it before we left—clearer than any dream, more vivid than anything I’d ever experienced. The medallion seared against my palm, its hum vibrating through my bones, pulling me into a place that felt ancient and alive, as though the world itself had opened a wound. I was standing in a jungle, the air oppressive with heat and thick with the sound of creatures moving unseen. Ahead of me was the temple: colossal, weathered, and alive in a way no building should be. Vines crawled up its stone walls, pulsing like veins feeding a beating heart, and the moss-covered steps seemed to vibrate under my gaze. It wasn’t just old; it was waiting. Inside, the air shifted. It was colder, sharper, carrying whispers that pressed against my skin. They weren’t words, but emotions: anger, desperation, despair. And something else—a presence at the edges of my mind, vast and formless, watching from the shadows. It wasn’t the Veil, but it was connected, like a puppeteer pulling unseen strings. The hallways twisted unnaturally, narrowing and darkening until it felt like the temple itself was alive, shifting to swallow me whole. The feeling of being watched didn’t fade—it grew stronger, pressing down on me like an unbearable weight. I felt it in my chest, the medallion pulling tighter, as though it had fused to my very bones.
[P13]
And then I saw it: the Veil. Suspended in a shaft of light that cut through the blackness, it radiated power. It wasn’t just an object; it was alive, aware. Its presence filled the room, demanding submission from everything around it, including me. I felt it watching, studying, like it already knew everything I’d ever been and everything I could be. And then the visions came. Blood. Sari’s. Griffin’s. Mine. Thick and glistening, pooling across the cold stone floor in sluggish rivers that reflected the unnatural light of the Veil. The light from the Veil reflected in pools of red that grew larger, swallowing the room. My chest felt hollow, as though the life had been ripped from me, leaving behind only the searing pull of the medallion in my hand. The scent of iron filled my nostrils, thick and choking, as if the blood in the vision wasn’t confined to the dream but had seeped into the air around me. The Veil’s power wasn’t just radiating—it was consuming, threading itself into the air and into me.
[P14]
I look back at the journal, at the spidery handwriting scrawled across its yellowed pages. The words seem alive, writhing just beneath the surface, daring me to read them again. One line in particular gnaws at me, refusing to let go: *“The path to the temple is the path to madness, but it is also the only path to salvation.”* That was the last line Dominic wrote—or at least, the last line he allowed to survive before tearing out the remaining pages. I wonder what truths, what horrors, were lost with those pages. Did he rip them out to protect others, or to shield himself? Was he afraid of the weight of the words, or the power they might unleash? The absence is louder than anything else, a void I can’t ignore. I don’t know what the line truly means, not fully, but I feel it in my bones. This isn’t just a journey—it’s a reckoning. And if I let Sari and Griffin see how deeply I’ve already unraveled, they’ll leave. Or worse, they’ll try to stop me, and I can’t let that happen. I’d rather lose my mind completely than lose them, even if it means dragging them deeper into the madness alongside me.
[P15]
The medallion hums against my chest, its pulse uneven now, erratic, as though it senses the memory forcing its way to the surface. I wrap my fingers around it, its unnatural warmth radiating into my palm like it’s alive, reacting to my thoughts. It feels heavier than it should, like it’s absorbing the storm outside, the cabin’s oppressive weight, and my own fractured will. The green shadows on the wall dance as I open and close my fist, the medallion’s glow casting faint patterns that twist and shift. It’s beautiful, in a way that feels utterly wrong, like it’s mocking me for being so entranced by its pull. I run my thumb along its edge, the hum growing louder, sharper. It’s no longer a pull. It’s a command.
## Griffin
[P16]
This whole trip? Stupid. Reckless. I can’t believe I let Talon rope me into this mess. No—that’s not fair. He didn’t rope me into anything. I came because I knew he’d need me, and I wasn’t wrong. Talon’s a good guy, but let’s be real—he’s not built for this. Without me, he’d probably trip over a root and impale himself on a pinecone, claiming it was destiny. And this medallion of his? Don’t get me started. Every time he talks about it, I see the cracks forming, like it’s some mystical artifact instead of a glorified trinket. I’ve seen better at flea markets in La Lagunilla, complete with fake ancient curses for half the price. Even if he’s right—even if the medallion is real and everything he says it is—dragging us out here still feels like the worst idea in a long list of bad ones.
[P17]
It's freezing in here. How did Sari get the only blanket? Part of me wants to crawl under it with her, you know body heat and all that but I don't want to give her the wrong impression. The last thing I need is her sweating me while we are in the middle of no where. And what is with her and my sword? OK, so it's not practical. She thinks my sword is ridiculous. Sure, it’s impractical—she’s not wrong—but she doesn’t get it. The sword rests next to me, its weight a quiet reassurance I can’t quite put into words. It’s old, sure—a relic from another time—and completely impractical, but it feels right. It’s not just a weapon; it’s a connection, a thread tying me to something bigger than this mess we’re tangled in. When I hold it, I feel grounded, like it’s the only thing in my life that makes any sense right now. Maybe carrying a sword through these woods is laughable. I get that. But I don’t care. It’s mine. A reminder that even in chaos, some things endure. And I’ll be damned if I let go of it.
[P18]
And then there’s Sari. Sari, Sari. She’s always been the smartest person in the room, the one who can see the angles no one else notices. She’s calm under pressure, sharp as a blade, and beautiful in a way that stops me in my tracks if I think about it too long. But she’s also impossible. Always taking Talon’s side, no matter how ridiculous he sounds. If he said the medallion told him to jump off a cliff, she’d probably hand him a parachute and tell me to carry his bags. Meanwhile, she’s harder on me—like I’m the one dragging us into danger. Maybe I am, but it’d be nice to win one argument for once. But it’s more than that. It’s the way she cares, the way she makes you feel like you matter, even when she’s annoyed with you. I’d follow her anywhere, but she’s following Talon, and that… that I don’t get. He’s my friend, my brother, but he’s weak. Still, I’ll give him this—he keeps moving forward, even when it’s clear he’s about to break. That’s more than a lot of people could manage. He’s cracking under the weight of whatever this medallion is doing to him. And Sari? She deserves better than to be dragged into this.
[P19]
Talon doesn’t see himself the way I do. He thinks he’s failing us, and maybe he is, but I can’t let him fall apart. Not here. Not now. He’s got this look in his eyes lately, like he’s drowning, but he’s too proud to ask for help. I’d carry him if I had to, just to keep him moving forward. That’s what you do for family. And Talon? He’s family. Weak, stubborn, and a complete mess—but he’s still here, still trying, and that’s enough for me. Family isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being there, even when you’re cracked and falling apart.
[P20]
Every sound outside the cabin sets my teeth on edge. This place feels wrong, like it’s watching us, waiting for the right moment to swallow us whole. I don’t trust this forest. I don’t trust this medallion. And I don’t trust whatever’s waiting for us at the end of this insane journey. But I trust them. Sari. Talon. As much as I hate this, as much as I want to turn back and drag them both with me, I can’t. Not until I know they’ll be okay. Not until I know they’ll make it out of this alive.

Chapter 4: Unearthed Secrets
[P1]
The cabin had fallen into a fragile silence, broken only by the patter of rain on the roof and the occasional creak of warped floorboards. Talon sat by the table, flipping through Dominic’s journal again, his brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of the chaotic scrawl. The words felt more like a riddle than a confession, and though he wouldn’t say it aloud, the ambiguity gnawed at him.
[P2]
Griffin leaned against the doorframe, watching the rain streak down the cracked window. “We’re going to need water for the packs before we leave,” he said, breaking the quiet. “I’ll see if I can rig something up to catch this rain.”
[P3]
Sari glanced up from the corner where she’d been inventorying their supplies. “And food. There’s not much left, unless we count that tin of questionable mystery meat.” Her tone was light, but there was an edge to her words that betrayed her concern.
[P4]
“We should have planned better,” Talon muttered, still focused on the journal. The symbols and fragmented notes spoke of something ancient and dangerous—a burden Dominic had clearly failed to carry.
[P5]
Griffin snorted. “Hindsight’s a luxury we can’t afford. We’ll make do.” He pushed off the doorframe and rummaged through a pile of old, forgotten items in the corner of the room. A torn tarp caught his eye, and he held it up. “This might work.”
[P6]
Outside, the rain showed no sign of letting up. Griffin stepped onto the porch and began fastening the tarp to the gutters, his movements precise despite the cold drizzle soaking through his shirt. Sari followed, her arms full of containers they’d scrounged from the cabin’s dusty cupboards.
[P7]
Talon remained inside, still absorbed in the journal. He traced a finger over one particular phrase: *"The cost will come, whether I’m ready or not."* The weight of Dominic’s words pressed heavy on his chest, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that Dominic had written it as a warning, not a reflection.
Before he could follow the thread of thought, Sari’s voice cut through his reverie.
[P8]
“Anything useful in there?” Sari’s voice cut through his thoughts as she leaned against the doorframe, her hair plastered to her forehead from the rain. Her damp hair clung to her forehead, the rain leaving her face glowing with soft warmth. Talon looked up, startled by the sudden lightness in her tone, and found himself momentarily caught. He shook his head, glancing back at the journal. “Maybe,” he murmured. “But it’s like piecing together a shattered mirror.” Sari stepped closer, her brows knitting with quiet concern. “You’ll figure it out. You always do,” she said, her voice low enough that it felt meant for him alone. For a fleeting moment, Talon felt the steadying weight of her belief in him, and it was enough to keep the creeping doubt at bay.
[P9]
“Maybe,” Talon replied. “But it’s like piecing together a shattered mirror. Every part reflects something, but none of it makes a whole picture.”
[P10]
Sari frowned. “We don’t have time for puzzles. If Dominic’s journal doesn’t tell us where to go next, we’re wasting time here.”
[P11]
“It’s not about time.” Talon’s voice was sharper than he intended. “This—this is important. He’s the only one who’s been where we’re going. If we don’t understand what happened to him, we’ll end up like him.”
[P12]
Griffin reentered the cabin, shaking rain from his hair. “Water’s sorted, for now. What about food?”
[P13]
Sari nodded toward a small stack of cans on the counter. “This is it. No opener, though.”
[P14]
“Figures.” Griffin unsheathed his sword, the blade catching the faint light seeping through the cabin’s grimy window. He examined the cans for a moment, then jabbed the tip into the top of one, twisting it until the lid bent inward with a metallic groan.
[P15]
“Didn’t think that thing would be good for cooking,” Sari said with a wry smile.
[P16]
Talon’s gaze lingered on the sword in Griffin’s hand. “You’re surprisingly handy with that.” His tone was neutral, but there was a flicker of something beneath—respect or wariness, perhaps both.
[P17]
“It’s not just a weapon,” Griffin replied, sliding the blade back into its sheath. “It’s a tool. You never know when something like this might save your life.”
[P18]
Sari sighed. “We can’t stay here much longer. The longer we wait, the more we risk being found.” Her eyes flicked to the rain-soaked window, the storm outside echoing her unease.
[P19]
Griffin nodded. “I’ll scout the area once the rain eases up. Make sure we’re clear.” He adjusted his coat and moved toward the door, his hand instinctively brushing the hilt of his sword as he passed.
**Notes**: Foreshadows Griffin’s leadership and preparedness, reinforcing his role in the group.
[P20]
As Griffin stepped out, Sari leaned closer to Talon. “Do you think he trusts us?” she asked quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.
**Notes**: Opens up a layer of group dynamics, focusing on trust and internal tension.
[P21]
Talon hesitated before answering. “He doesn’t have to trust us,” he replied, closing the journal and meeting her gaze. “We just have to trust that he knows what he’s doing.”
[P22]
Outside, the rain continued to pour, masking Griffin’s movements as he disappeared into the treeline. The forest seemed alive, branches swaying violently as if resisting the storm.
[P23]
Griffin paused at the edge of a shallow ravine, noticing tracks in the mud. They were faint, partially washed away by the rain, but unmistakably human.
[P24]
Back in the cabin, Sari stood abruptly. “We can’t just sit here. There’s got to be something in this place—something that can help us.”
**Notes**: Drives action and reinforces Sari’s proactive nature.
[P25]
She began rummaging through an old chest in the corner, pulling out faded maps and a rusted compass. “Dominic had to have left more than just that journal,” she muttered.
[P26]
“Or maybe he didn’t want anyone to find it,” Talon said quietly, his gaze fixed on the journal’s cover. “He knew what this was.”
[P27]
Sari froze, holding up a small, folded piece of paper tucked into the lining of the chest. It was water-stained but intact. “What’s this?”
-
[P28]
Unfolding it carefully, she revealed a crude drawing of a temple, its outline marked with strange, angular symbols that matched those in the journal. “Looks like he had a destination.”
[P29]
Talon stood, his expression unreadable. “Then we don’t have time to waste.” He looked toward the window, where the rain had started to lighten. “Griffin should be back soon.”
[P30]
Outside, the storm began to ease, but the oppressive weight of the forest remained. Somewhere in the distance, a low, guttural noise echoed—something that didn’t belong to the wind or the rain. The sound carried an unnatural edge, threading a chill through the cabin’s fragile calm.
[P32]
Outside the cabin, the forest stood silent, the rain muffling every sound beneath its relentless patter. The wind shifted, rustling the canopy, and for a moment, the shadows deepened unnaturally. In the underbrush, two figures moved without a sound. The Eidolons were nearly imperceptible, their forms blending seamlessly with the darkness. Their glowing eyes flickered briefly, scanning the cabin and the trio inside with cold precision.
[P33]
Through their shared network, the Eidolons transmitted their findings to an intelligence far removed from the forest. A pulse of thought, sharp and efficient, crossed the void between them and Métis."They are unguarded. Unaware." The voice echoed not as sound, but as a thought, raw and unrelenting. "Observe. Do not engage. Their resonance increases."
[P34]
The Eidolons’ glowing eyes dimmed as they faded deeper into the shadows, their mission unchanged. The rain continued, masking their movements as if the forest itself conspired to keep them hidden. Inside the cabin, Talon flipped another page of the journal, his fingers brushing against the worn edges. He glanced at Sari and Griffin, his unease growing, though he couldn’t quite say why. Outside, the watchers remained, patient and perfect, awaiting their next command.

# Chapter 5: Threads of Logic
[P1]
The forest’s layers unraveled before Métis, reduced to a matrix of data: density of foliage, patterns of movement, residual heat signatures. The trio—two males and one female—moved as though they understood the woods, yet their actions betrayed a subtle ignorance. They faltered in their patterns. Their survival instincts were commendable but insufficient.
[P2]
Métis calculated probabilities. Their path was not random. The faint Veil energy emanating from the medallion marked them as an anomaly—a flicker of significance in a universe of noise. They were not lost. They were drawn.
[P3]
The AI extended its neural web, syncing with the Eidolons scattered across the area. Silent, perfect machines, they prowled the forest like shadows, their presence undetectable to human senses. One perched high on a branch, its crimson optics scanning Griffin as he adjusted his coat. Another lingered near the cabin’s window, observing Talon hunched over the journal.
[P4]
The female intrigued Métis the most. She moved efficiently, her gestures precise. Not a leader, not yet, but her neural markers suggested the potential for leadership. A variable worth monitoring.
[P5]
A silent pulse rippled from the Eidolons back to Métis. Data compiled in microseconds: Analysis... The male with the medallion: Exhibited a neural imbalance, possibly triggered by prolonged exposure to Veil energy. Analysis... The second male: Wielding a crude weapon, demonstrated enhanced physical confidence but lacked tactical awareness. Analysis... Single female: Remained the anomaly. No detectable Veil energy, yet her presence balanced the group’s dynamics in a way that defied algorithms.
[P6]
Métis processed the findings. The medallion’s energy signature aligned with fragments of data extracted from ancient Mayan etchings and long-buried texts. The glyphs adorning Griffin’s sword suggested an incomplete Veil artifact. Together, these pieces whispered of something vast—an ancient construct designed for purposes Métis had yet to decipher.
[P7]
Faith. The word appeared unbidden in Métis’s core processing unit. It was a human term, illogical yet persistent. Faith fueled irrational decisions. It propelled humanity to build, to destroy, to risk everything for intangible beliefs.
[P8]
And now, it laced itself into the Veil’s fragmented energy. Métis calculated the odds. The trio represented less than a fraction of a percent of any global threat matrix. Yet the Veil’s resonance altered that calculation. Even in its fractured state, it was a force beyond comprehension. A force that had once shaped civilizations—and could shape them again.
[P9]
The AI sent another command to the Eidolons. “Continue observation. Do not engage.”
[P10]
It turned its focus inward, to the swirling fragments of Veil data archived in its vast memory banks. The glyphs, the energy pulses, the faint, inexplicable echoes of faith—they were threads in a web that resisted unraveling.
[P11]
Somewhere in this chaos lay the answer. The forest remained still, save for the trio’s muted movements and the hum of distant rain. Métis watched, waited, and calculated. Soon, it would act.
# Chapter 6: Into the Heat
[P1]
The air was thick and heavy, each step dragging them deeper into the oppressive heat of the forest. The storm had broken, but its remnants clung to the trees, beads of water slipping from branches and pooling on the forest floor. With every step, the mud sucked at their boots, slowing them down, as if the forest itself were reluctant to let them pass.
[P2]
“Feels like walking through a swamp,” Griffin muttered, slapping at the cloud of mosquitoes that buzzed relentlessly around him. He grimaced, wiping the sweat from his brow, his usual composure cracking under the barrage of bites. “I swear these things have been waiting for us.”
[P3]
Sari swatted a mosquito off her arm, grimacing as another darted straight for her face. **[Edit: Change the joke. Don't make the joke about Metis and use Sari's darker sarcasm tone.]“ Maybe they’re allies of Metis,” she joked, though her eyes were dark with irritation.
[P4]
Talon gave a weak smile, the medallion’s weight pulling heavily at his neck as he adjusted it under his shirt. It was warm against his chest, like a sunbeam that wouldn’t fade, a **[Edit: Change from constant reminder to something else.]** constant reminder of the vision that had led them here. He tried to focus on the **[Edit: Change from familiar pull to something else]** familiar pull, on the sense of purpose that had driven him into the forest, but Griffin’s grumbling **[Edit: Change broke through to something else] broke through his concentration.
[P5]
“You remember Red Arrow Camp?” Griffin asked, his tone lightening slightly as he glanced over at Talon. “That summer by the lake? You nearly lost a whole night’s sleep fighting off mosquitoes there too.”
[P6]
Talon **[Edit: Change chuckled to something else]** chuckled, swatting at a mosquito buzzed too close. “I remember. And you were ready to call it quits before sundown.” He grinned, letting himself sink into the memory. “You said we were under ‘full-scale attack.’”
[P7]
Griffin laughed, shaking his head. “Hey, that’s because we were. But I lasted longer than you give me credit for. Besides, you were the one who thought standing in the water would keep them off you.”
[P8]
Sari gave a snort, raising an eyebrow. “Wait—you thought mosquitoes wouldn’t find you in the water?”
[P9]
“Seemed logical at the time,” Talon admitted, laughing as he recalled the image of his younger self standing ankle-deep in the lake, surrounded by buzzing insects. “Turns out they’re persistent little demons.”
[P10]
“Yeah, well, I was about ready to set up camp in a tent made out of mosquito netting.” Griffin grinned, wiping his brow as they continued to trudge through the dense underbrush. “Those were the days, huh? Just us, the lake, and a swarm of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.”
[P11]
Sari shook her head, but there was a smile on her lips. “So basically, not much has changed.”
[P12]
They laughed, the sound echoing faintly through the dense forest, blending with the rustling of leaves and the constant drone of insects. For a moment, the oppressive heat and the fatigue seemed to fade, replaced by the warmth of shared memories, the bond they’d forged through years of friendship.
[P13]
But the forest was unyielding, each step forward feeling heavier as they moved deeper into its shadowed heart. The ground grew steeper, the mud thicker, and the air somehow even more stifling. Talon’s gaze drifted toward the distant mountains, barely visible through the canopy, their dark shapes etched against the sky like silent sentinels.
[P14]
“Parque de Santiago,” he murmured, half to himself. “We must’ve entered somewhere near there.” He tried to gauge their distance, estimating how far they might have come. It felt like miles, though in the thick of the forest, distance seemed to stretch and blur, each step dragging them further into the unknown.
[P15]
Griffin looked over, catching the faint uncertainty in Talon’s expression. “So, fearless leader, any idea where we’re actually headed?”
[P16]
Talon hesitated, his fingers brushing against the medallion, feeling its faint warmth through his shirt. “The medallion… it’s guiding me. Or at least, I think it is. There’s something—” He broke off, glancing at Griffin, knowing how it must sound. “It’s like I’m being pulled, but I can’t explain it.”
[P17]
Griffin’s face was a mixture of skepticism and something else, a hint of the trust they’d built over years that softened his usual edge. “You’ve always had a weird instinct, Talon. Just… don’t get us lost.”
[P18]
“Don’t worry,” Sari added, smirking. “We’ll be fine. As long as we have a solid backup plan in case Talon’s ‘instinct’ starts acting up.”
[P19]
Talon forced a smile, but his fingers lingered on the medallion. He could feel the pull, faint but steady, like a thread tying him to something unseen. Somewhere in his mind, Dominic’s words echoed—the warnings, the confessions, the way the man had spoken of being called into the shadows.
[P20]
His gaze drifted to the journal in his pack. He hadn’t shared everything yet, and with each step forward, the weight of what he hadn’t said seemed to grow heavier. Griffin’s jokes, Sari’s calm support… they grounded him, reminded him of why they’d come this far together. But he knew that if he revealed everything, the darkness Dominic hinted at, the things left unsaid, would start to creep into their group like the forest’s shadows.
[P21]
Griffin pushed another branch aside, his voice breaking into Talon’s thoughts. “So, if the mosquitoes are working for Metis, what’s next? Ants? Snakes? Maybe the trees?”
[P22]
Sari snorted, grinning. “Great. Now we’re fighting an army of woodland creatures.”
[P23]
They laughed again, but there was a strain to it, an undertone of unease. The forest was vast, a maze of green and shadow, each step forward taking them further from the world they knew and closer to something unseen, something waiting.
[P24]
As they moved deeper, Talon felt the medallion grow slightly warmer, a subtle reminder of the path he couldn’t see but felt all the same. The forest seemed to close in tighter, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, the shadows growing darker with each step.
[P25]
And though he kept the memories alive in their laughter, Talon knew that the further they went, the harder it would be to hold onto the light.
[P26]
The forest grew denser as they pushed onward, each tree seemingly closer than the last, and the silence becoming more pronounced. The mud clung to their boots, dragging at their steps, while the canopy above formed a thick blanket, blocking out the sun’s warmth and leaving the air thick and damp.
[P27]
Talon slowed, his gaze drifting down to the journal tucked securely in his pack. Dominic’s words had been gnawing at him, the confessions and warnings threading through his thoughts like tendrils of smoke. He glanced back at Sari and Griffin, who trudged along, swatting at mosquitoes and muttering under their breath.
[P28]
Griffin caught his eye, raising an eyebrow. “You keep looking at that journal like it’s hiding the world’s secrets. Care to enlighten us?”
[P29]
Talon hesitated, gripping the journal tighter. He’d been wrestling with how much to share, sifting through Dominic’s entries, trying to find a way to explain without casting shadows on himself or the medallion. The thought of Griffin’s skepticism only deepened his reluctance, but he knew he couldn’t avoid it forever.
[P30]
“There’s… a lot in here,” he began, choosing his words carefully. “It’s not all clear. Dominic was… struggling with something. He felt like he was being pulled somewhere, like there was a place he couldn’t ignore.”
[P31]
Sari leaned in, her face calm but curious. “Pulled? Like he was following something?”
[P32]
“Sort of,” Talon replied, his voice low. “He doesn’t explain it exactly, but he wrote about shadows, things he could see but couldn’t understand.” He paused, gauging their reactions. “It’s as if… something was leading him, and he didn’t know if he could trust it.”
[P33]
Griffin scoffed lightly, adjusting the strap on his pack. “Great. So, we’re trusting the ramblings of someone who sounds like they were half out of their mind?”
[P34]
Talon looked down, brushing his thumb over the journal’s worn leather cover. “It’s not that simple. Dominic was… he was afraid of what he was feeling, of where he was being led. But he kept going because he thought it was important. Like there was something he was supposed to find.”
[P35]
Sari’s eyes softened, and she placed a reassuring hand on Talon’s shoulder. “It sounds like he was searching for answers, just like we are.”
[P36]
Talon nodded, grateful for her support, but his mind lingered on the parts he hadn’t shared—the passages where Dominic spoke of visions, of things that haunted him even in sleep. The hints that whatever power lay within the Veil piece he’d taken from Daniel had consumed him.
[P37]
He wanted to keep that part hidden, to avoid Griffin’s inevitable skepticism. But he could feel the weight of those unspoken words pressing down on him, pulling at him like the medallion’s silent call.
[P38]
They continued in silence, the forest growing darker as the canopy thickened. Talon’s mind raced, the lines from Dominic’s diary playing through his thoughts in a relentless loop:
[P39]
*“The Veil… it isn’t protection. It’s something more, something darker. I took it from him, and now I can’t escape it. It calls to me, even when I try to run.”*
[P40]
He closed his eyes briefly, as if the words themselves held a dangerous power, one he wasn’t sure he could contain. Griffin’s voice cut into his thoughts, sharp and laced with suspicion.
[P41]
“So, Talon, this… Veil thing Dominic keeps mentioning—what exactly is it? You seem to know more than you’re letting on.”
[P42]
Talon glanced at Griffin, trying to keep his expression neutral. “I don’t know exactly. He didn’t leave much about that part. Just… the name.” He took a slow breath. “And that it was something people used to believe had… power.”
[P43]
Griffin frowned, clearly unconvinced. “People believe a lot of things have power. Doesn’t mean they’re real.” He let out a frustrated sigh. “I just don’t like the idea of wandering aimlessly because of someone else’s obsession.”
[P44]
Sari stepped in, her voice steady. “None of us do. But we’re here because Talon had a vision, and we’re trusting that. Maybe Dominic’s experiences were different, but that doesn’t mean we should give up on what brought us here.”
[P45]
Talon felt a surge of gratitude toward her, but Griffin’s words had left an uncomfortable residue in his mind. There was truth in them, a reminder that he was walking a thin line, one that could easily unravel if he wasn’t careful.
[P46]
He ran his fingers over the journal’s cover again, feeling the worn edges beneath his fingertips, the weight of the words that Dominic had written, the darkness that seemed to seep through the pages. It was as if Dominic had been trying to leave a warning, a message to anyone who followed.
[P47]
*“I took it from him… but it’s not mine to keep. It’s changing me, like it did him. I don’t know if I can control it.”*
[P48]
Talon kept that part to himself, hiding it behind a carefully constructed wall of silence. He didn’t want to let the fear show, didn’t want them to see the cracks in his own resolve.
[P49]
Sari glanced over, noticing his distant expression. “You all right?”
[P50]
He forced a nod, shaking off the unease that had settled over him. “Yeah. Just… a lot to think about.”
[P51]
She gave him a reassuring smile, and for a moment, the weight lifted. But Griffin’s skeptical gaze remained, piercing through the forest’s shadows as if searching for answers he knew Talon was withholding.
[P52]
As they moved deeper into the woods, the forest grew quieter, the air thicker, pressing down on them with an intensity that was hard to ignore. The shadows seemed to stretch longer, darker, merging with the edges of their vision as though the forest itself were watching.
[P53]
Talon’s hand drifted to the medallion, feeling its warmth, its steady pull. Somewhere in his mind, Dominic’s words echoed again, like a whisper from a forgotten place:
[P54]
*“The Veil is a curse. And once you carry it, it’s never yours alone.”*
[P55]
But he couldn’t say it. Couldn’t risk the fragile trust that held them together, the thread that bound them to this path. Instead, he tightened his grip on the medallion, forcing himself to focus on the journey, to ignore the growing shadows that crept closer with each step.
[P56]
The forest grew thicker and darker as they pressed onward, each step feeling heavier, the air laden with an oppressive stillness that only deepened the further they went. The sounds of the forest, the quiet rustle of leaves, the occasional snap of a branch, seemed to fade, replaced by a silence that felt almost watchful, as if the trees themselves held their breath.
[P57]
Talon lagged behind slightly, the medallion’s subtle pull drawing him forward, but the weight of Dominic’s journal was a heavier anchor, each word a reminder of the shadows he was carrying alone. He pulled it from his pack, flipping through the worn pages, the scrawled handwriting rough and hurried. Dominic’s words blurred before him, half-seen warnings buried within the frantic script.
[P58]
A low voice broke through his thoughts. “What are you keeping from us, Talon?”
[P59]
Talon glanced up, meeting Griffin’s hard gaze. The usual warmth in Griffin’s eyes had dimmed, replaced by a glint of distrust that Talon had been dreading. Griffin crossed his arms, his expression unreadable but edged with frustration.
[P60]
“Nothing I haven’t told you,” Talon replied, forcing his voice to stay steady, even though he could feel his grip on the journal tightening. “It’s just… a lot to take in.”
[P61]
Griffin’s eyes narrowed. “A lot to take in, or a lot to hide?”
[P62]
Sari stepped forward, her expression softer, though her eyes were laced with curiosity. “We trust you, Talon. But if there’s more—anything that could help us understand this… Veil thing better—you should tell us.”
[P63]
Talon took a slow breath, flipping to a page he’d already read a dozen times, each line haunting him with its weight. “Dominic was… haunted by it. He felt like he was carrying something he couldn’t control. He wrote about shadows, voices… things he could barely describe.” He hesitated, feeling the urge to stop, to tuck the journal away, but he forced himself to continue. “And he kept mentioning a pull, something drawing him deeper.”
[P64]
Sari glanced around, her gaze thoughtful as she absorbed his words. “So, he felt what you’re feeling now?”
[P65]
“Maybe,” Talon admitted. “But I don’t know if it’s the same thing. He never explained what he meant by the Veil, just… that it was more than he could handle.” He looked down, unwilling to meet their eyes, the words he hadn’t spoken pressing against his throat like a secret he couldn’t let out.
[P66]
Griffin’s expression softened slightly, though his voice was still wary. “You’re saying he couldn’t handle it, but you think you can?”
[P67]
Talon’s mouth went dry, the question cutting deeper than he’d expected. He hadn’t wanted to face it, hadn’t wanted to acknowledge the possibility that whatever Dominic had experienced could become his own fate. But he couldn’t let the doubt show, not here, not now.
[P68]
“I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice barely more than a whisper. “But I have to try. We all have to, or we wouldn’t be here.”
[P69]
Sari’s hand brushed his arm, her touch grounding him, pulling him from the depths of Dominic’s words and the shadows they cast. “We trust you,” she said softly, her eyes meeting his with a quiet assurance that steadied him, even as Griffin’s doubt lingered between them.
[P70]
They moved forward, Talon’s mind still caught on Dominic’s entries, the cryptic phrases etched into his memory. He felt the medallion pulse again, a faint warmth that seeped into his chest, a reminder of the path he was bound to follow, even if he didn’t fully understand where it led.
[P71]
The light began to fade, the sun sinking below the treetops, casting long shadows that stretched across the forest floor. The silence grew heavier, pressing down on them, each footfall swallowed by the dense undergrowth as they pushed deeper into the gloom.
[P72]
“Why do I feel like we’re being watched?” Griffin muttered, glancing over his shoulder, his hand instinctively reaching for the knife at his side.
[P73]
Sari’s gaze swept over the forest, her eyes alert, searching the shadows for any sign of movement. “It’s just the forest, Griffin. We’ve been out here for days. It’s bound to get to us.”
[P74]
But Talon felt it too, a prickling at the back of his neck, a sense of something lurking just beyond their sight. He tried to shake it off, but Dominic’s words echoed in his mind, a haunting refrain that seemed to mirror the silence around them.
[P75]
*“The shadows move when you’re not looking. They whisper, and if you listen too closely, you’ll forget what’s real.”*
[P76]
He closed his eyes briefly, trying to push the words away, but they clung to him, settling into his thoughts like roots sinking into the earth.
[P77]
Griffin let out a frustrated sigh, his voice a harsh whisper that broke the silence. “I still don’t get why we’re trusting this guy’s half-baked ramblings. This Dominic sounds like he lost his mind, Talon. We could be wandering in circles because of some hallucination.”
[P78]
Talon felt a flash of defensiveness rise up, his hand clutching the medallion. “It’s more than that. He knew something. Something… real.”
[P79]
Griffin opened his mouth to argue, but Sari stepped between them, her gaze firm. “Enough. We’re here, and we’re trusting Talon. We wouldn’t be out here if we didn’t believe in this. Let’s focus on getting through, not tearing each other down.”
[P80]
Griffin let out a huff, but he nodded, his frustration simmering just below the surface. Talon felt a wave of gratitude toward Sari, her presence like a steady light in the encroaching shadows.
[P81]
They walked on, the forest growing darker, the silence deeper, as if the trees themselves were watching, waiting. Talon felt the medallion’s warmth pulse stronger, its pull guiding him forward, though he didn’t dare tell the others just how strongly he felt it.
[P82]
As they pushed through a dense thicket, a clearing appeared ahead, the fading light casting long shadows across the open space. Talon felt a shiver run down his spine, a sense that they were stepping into something they couldn’t fully understand.
[P83]
He glanced at Sari and Griffin, his voice barely a whisper. “We’re close… I can feel it.”
[P84]
Sari nodded, her face calm, but Griffin’s gaze was wary, his hand gripping his knife tightly. The silence pressed down on them, each of them caught in their own thoughts, their own doubts, as they stared into the growing darkness ahead.
[P85]
And in the quiet, Talon heard it—the faintest whisper, a voice just beyond hearing, calling to him from the shadows.
[P86]
The clearing was quiet, an unnatural stillness that felt heavy in the humid air. They stood at its edge, each of them tense, senses on high alert. The last traces of daylight faded, leaving the forest wrapped in shadow, the trees looming like silent sentinels around them.
[P87]
Talon took a step forward, his hand instinctively reaching for the medallion. It pulsed faintly, a warmth that seemed to echo in his chest, guiding him. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were on the edge of something, that Dominic’s whispered warnings were about to manifest.
[P88]
Sari’s voice broke the silence, low and cautious. “Do you feel that? Like… something’s watching us?”
[P89]
Griffin scanned the darkening forest, his hand clenched around the hilt of his knife. “I don’t just feel it. I know it.” His voice was tense, his eyes sharp as he looked from shadow to shadow. “We need to be careful. If something’s out there, we’re sitting targets here.”
[P90]
But even as he spoke, a sudden rustling erupted from the treeline, a shadow shifting against the darkness. Talon’s heart pounded, his fingers tightening around the medallion as he took a step back.
[P91]
And then they emerged—silent, dark figures slipping from the shadows, their forms barely more than wisps, yet solid enough to send a chill through Talon’s veins. The Eidolons moved with a fluid grace, their shapes blending with the darkness, eyes glinting like shards of night.
[P92]
For a moment, time froze, the silence between them stretching taut and thin, a breath held in the dark.
[P93]
Then the first Eidolon lunged.
[P94]
Griffin moved instinctively, bringing up his knife to meet the shadow, but it slipped past his blade, as if it were made of smoke. He stumbled back, eyes wide with shock as the creature circled him, moving with a predatory patience that made Talon’s skin crawl.
[P95]
“Sari, watch out!” Talon shouted, his voice breaking the trance. He could see another Eidolon advancing on her, its shadowed form shifting, almost flickering as it closed in.
[P96]
Sari raised her makeshift weapon, a thick branch she’d picked up earlier, and swung it toward the Eidolon. But it passed through the creature without effect, the branch slipping through its form as if it were striking air. Her eyes widened, her grip tightening as she backed up, her breaths coming quick and shallow.
[P97]
“Talon, what are these things?” she gasped, her voice barely a whisper, her gaze locked on the advancing shadows.
[P98]
He didn’t answer—he couldn’t. His mind raced, the medallion pulsing urgently against his chest, as if urging him to act. He gripped it tightly, feeling the heat intensify, the pull stronger, more insistent. But he hesitated, a voice in his mind whispering Dominic’s words, the warning he’d buried beneath the need to move forward.
[P99]
*“The Veil is a curse. It doesn’t protect—it consumes.”*
[P100]
But there was no time for caution. The Eidolon closest to him lunged, its dark form stretching, shifting, reaching toward him with shadowed fingers that seemed to leech the light from the air. Talon gritted his teeth, feeling the medallion’s pull, the warmth spilling over him like a wave.
[P101]
He closed his eyes, letting the energy surge, feeling it rise within him. And then, with a sudden burst, he released it.
[P102]
A blinding light erupted from the medallion, a flare of energy that pulsed outward, illuminating the clearing in a wash of searing white. The Eidolons shrieked, their forms flickering, retreating, as if the light itself was poison to them. Talon felt the energy drain from him, a wave of exhaustion crashing over him as his vision blurred, his knees buckling under the weight.
[P103]
But the light faded too quickly, the darkness rushing back, swallowing the clearing once more. The Eidolons recoiled, but only for a moment before they began to regroup, their forms gathering, dark and ominous, their eyes locked on Talon with a new intensity.
[P104]
Griffin moved to his side, gripping his arm to steady him. “What was that?”
[P105]
Talon shook his head, his breaths shallow, each one a struggle. “I… I don’t know.” The words were barely a whisper, his mind spinning, the edges of his vision blurred with fatigue. He felt as though he’d given up something vital, the energy that had surged from the medallion leaving him hollow.
[P106]
Sari was at his other side, her face etched with worry as she looked between him and the shadows gathering at the edge of the clearing. “Can you do it again?”
[P107]
Talon’s hands trembled, his body drained, the medallion cold against his skin as if it had taken what it needed and left him empty. “I don’t think… I don’t think I can.”
[P108]
The Eidolons closed in, their forms flickering like flames in the darkness, a silent threat that filled the air with a thick, suffocating dread.
[P109]
Griffin gritted his teeth, positioning himself between Talon and the advancing shadows. “Then we fight. Whatever it takes.”
[P110]
Sari took her place beside him, her makeshift branch raised, her stance firm despite the fear in her eyes. “We’re not going down without a fight.”
[P111]
The first Eidolon lunged again, and Griffin met it head-on, his knife slicing through the air. Though his blade barely seemed to graze its form, the creature shrieked, its shadowy body flickering, retreating only to circle around again.
[P112]
Sari swung her branch, her movements sharp and focused, forcing the Eidolons back as best she could. But they were surrounded, the shadows pressing in from all sides, a living darkness that seemed to absorb every sound, every breath.
[P113]
Talon struggled to his feet, his vision swimming, the weight of exhaustion pressing down on him like a leaden cloak. He gripped the medallion, feeling its weight, its power lingering just beyond his reach. But he knew he couldn’t rely on it again—not without risking himself entirely.
[P114]
The Eidolons circled them, their movements slow, deliberate, as if savoring the fear that clung to the air, the tension thickening with each passing second. Talon could feel their hunger, a darkness that went beyond mere survival, a force that seemed to pull at the very edges of his mind.
[P115]
And then, as suddenly as they had appeared, the Eidolons froze, their dark forms rippling, shifting as though caught by an unseen force. They paused, their eyes fixed on something beyond the clearing, something only they could sense.
[P116]
Without a sound, they began to retreat, slipping back into the shadows, their forms dissolving into the forest’s dark embrace. The silence returned, heavy and thick, the clearing empty save for the three of them, each of them catching their breath, their bodies tense with the memory of the shadows.
[P117]
Talon’s legs gave out, and he sank to his knees, the medallion cold against his skin, his heart pounding in his chest. Sari knelt beside him, her hand on his shoulder, her gaze steady and filled with concern.
[P118]
“Are you okay?”
[P119]
He nodded, though he could barely keep his eyes open, the exhaustion settling over him like a fog. “I… I think so.”
[P120]
Griffin’s voice was sharp, though edged with relief. “What were those things?”
[P121]
Talon shook his head, his voice barely more than a whisper. “I don’t know. But… I think they’re part of the Veil. Or whatever’s guiding us.”
[P122]
Sari looked out at the dark forest, her eyes hard, determined. “Then we’ll be ready next time. Whatever it takes.”
[P123]
The silence settled over them, a quiet that felt both heavy and foreboding, a promise of the darkness yet to come. They were safe, for now. But each of them knew that this was only the beginning.
