# Chapter 5: Threads of Logic
[P1]
The forest’s layers unraveled before Métis, reduced to a matrix of data: density of foliage, patterns of movement, residual heat signatures. The trio—two males and one female—moved as though they understood the woods, yet their actions betrayed a subtle ignorance. They faltered in their patterns. Their survival instincts were commendable but insufficient.
[P2]
Métis calculated probabilities. Their path was not random. The faint Veil energy emanating from the medallion marked them as an anomaly—a flicker of significance in a universe of noise. They were not lost. They were drawn.
[P3]
The AI extended its neural web, syncing with the Eidolons scattered across the area. Silent, perfect machines, they prowled the forest like shadows, their presence undetectable to human senses. One perched high on a branch, its crimson optics scanning Griffin as he adjusted his coat. Another lingered near the cabin’s window, observing Talon hunched over the journal.
[P4]
The female intrigued Métis the most. She moved efficiently, her gestures precise. Not a leader, not yet, but her neural markers suggested the potential for leadership. A variable worth monitoring.
[P5]
A silent pulse rippled from the Eidolons back to Métis. Data compiled in microseconds: Analysis... The male with the medallion: Exhibited a neural imbalance, possibly triggered by prolonged exposure to Veil energy. Analysis... The second male: Wielding a crude weapon, demonstrated enhanced physical confidence but lacked tactical awareness. Analysis... Single female: Remained the anomaly. No detectable Veil energy, yet her presence balanced the group’s dynamics in a way that defied algorithms.
[P6]
Métis processed the findings. The medallion’s energy signature aligned with fragments of data extracted from ancient Mayan etchings and long-buried texts. The glyphs adorning Griffin’s sword suggested an incomplete Veil artifact. Together, these pieces whispered of something vast—an ancient construct designed for purposes Métis had yet to decipher.
[P7]
Faith. The word appeared unbidden in Métis’s core processing unit. It was a human term, illogical yet persistent. Faith fueled irrational decisions. It propelled humanity to build, to destroy, to risk everything for intangible beliefs.
[P8]
And now, it laced itself into the Veil’s fragmented energy. Métis calculated the odds. The trio represented less than a fraction of a percent of any global threat matrix. Yet the Veil’s resonance altered that calculation. Even in its fractured state, it was a force beyond comprehension. A force that had once shaped civilizations—and could shape them again.
[P9]
The AI sent another command to the Eidolons. “Continue observation. Do not engage.”
[P10]
It turned its focus inward, to the swirling fragments of Veil data archived in its vast memory banks. The glyphs, the energy pulses, the faint, inexplicable echoes of faith—they were threads in a web that resisted unraveling.
[P11]
Somewhere in this chaos lay the answer. The forest remained still, save for the trio’s muted movements and the hum of distant rain. Métis watched, waited, and calculated. Soon, it would act.
