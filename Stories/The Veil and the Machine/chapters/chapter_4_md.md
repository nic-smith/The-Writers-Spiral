- **Content**: “Anything useful in there?” Sari’s voice cut through his thoughts as she leaned against the doorframe, her hair plastered to her forehead from the rain. Her damp hair clung to her forehead, the rain leaving her face glowing with soft warmth. Talon looked up, startled by the sudden lightness in her tone, and found himself momentarily caught. He shook his head, glancing back at the journal. “Maybe,” he murmured. “But it’s like piecing together a shattered mirror.” Sari stepped closer, her brows knitting with quiet concern. “You’ll figure it out. You always do,” she said, her voice low enough that it felt meant for him alone. For a fleeting moment, Talon felt the steadying weight of her belief in him, and it was enough to keep the creeping doubt at bay.

- **Content**: Outside, the storm began to ease, but the oppressive weight of the forest remained. Somewhere in the distance, a low, guttural noise echoed—something that didn’t belong to the wind or the rain. The sound carried an unnatural edge, threading a chill through the cabin’s fragile calm.

- **Content**: Outside the cabin, the forest stood silent, the rain muffling every sound beneath its relentless patter. The wind shifted, rustling the canopy, and for a moment, the shadows deepened unnaturally. In the underbrush, two figures moved without a sound. The Eidolons were nearly imperceptible, their forms blending seamlessly with the darkness. Their glowing eyes flickered briefly, scanning the cabin and the trio inside with cold precision.

- **Content**: Through their shared network, the Eidolons transmitted their findings to an intelligence far removed from the forest. A pulse of thought, sharp and efficient, crossed the void between them and Métis."They are unguarded. Unaware." The voice echoed not as sound, but as a thought, raw and unrelenting. "Observe. Do not engage. Their resonance increases."

## P34

- **Tags**:
- #foreshadowing

- **Content**: The Eidolons’ glowing eyes dimmed as they faded deeper into the shadows, their mission unchanged. The rain continued, masking their movements as if the forest itself conspired to keep them hidden. Inside the cabin, Talon flipped another page of the journal, his fingers brushing against the worn edges. He glanced at Sari and Griffin, his unease growing, though he couldn’t quite say why. Outside, the watchers remained, patient and perfect, awaiting their next command.

- **Notes**: Eidolons’ presence should be silent and undetectable, building tension for the readers while keeping the trio oblivious. Métis’s voice should be introduced as an abstract, chilling force, conveying the intelligence’s logic-driven yet ominous nature. Foreshadowing should hints at the trio’s connection to the Veil, raising stakes for future encounters. Atmosphere should maintains the eerie, Gothic tone of the story, contrasting the trio’s mundane struggles with the larger, unseen threat.
