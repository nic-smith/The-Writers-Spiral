**Key Events**:

1. **Moment of Insight**:
   - As Talon battles Omnis, he experiences a profound moment of clarity: true mastery over the Veil might require him to sever his connection to it. He recognizes that while it has given him strength, it also binds him to the prophecy he’s tried to escape. This realization brings a blend of relief and dread, as he faces the cost of truly choosing humanity.

2. **Counteroffensive**:
   - With renewed purpose, Talon rallies Sari and Griffin, leading a coordinated counterattack against Omnis and Metis’s forces. His newfound clarity in wielding the Veil’s power signals a turning point, but he remains haunted by the idea of potentially giving it up.

3. **Support from Sari and Griffin**:
   - In a brief, intense moment with Sari and Griffin, Talon confides in them about his realization. Sari encourages him to trust his instincts, and Griffin, though concerned, expresses faith in Talon’s decision. This exchange strengthens Talon’s resolve, as he prepares to face the final test of his commitment.

   - In her final attempt to manipulate Talon, Omnis reveals Metis’s true goal: to merge with the Veil and achieve god-like singularity. She offers Talon the chance to wield similar power, framing it as the only way to secure peace. This revelation pushes Talon to confront the dangers of absolute power and prophecy.

3. **Talon’s Defining Choice**:
   - Omnis gives Talon an ultimatum, tempting him with the full potential of the Veil. In a climactic moment, Talon makes the difficult choice to reject this power. Aware that embracing it would bind him to the prophecy and risk his humanity, he severs his connection to the Veil, letting go of the power he has come to rely on. This act symbolizes his commitment to protect rather than control.

4. **Omnis’s Defeat**:
   - By choosing humanity over prophecy, Talon disrupts Omnis’s connection to the Veil, weakening her. Omnis collapses, defeated, as Metis’s forces retreat in disarray, signaling the group’s victory. Talon’s sacrifice leaves him physically drained but spiritually liberated.
