**Preface**

The fog curled around Sari, thick and suffocating, pressing against her like fingers tracing the edges of her skin. Every breath felt heavy, each inhale sharp and cold as it bit at her lungs. The trees loomed above her, skeletal and twisted, their branches clawing at the sky. She stumbled through the underbrush, her heart pounding in her chest, the rhythmic thud echoing in her ears. The world around her felt wrong—distorted, like it was unraveling at the seams.

Her foot caught on a root, and for a moment, she lost her balance. A sharp gasp escaped her lips as she fell to her knees, the damp earth soaking into her clothes. But the pain wasn’t just physical; it was something deeper, a weight that pressed down on her soul. Everything felt hollow, like a world collapsing in on itself.

Then, without warning, **the memory** hit her—a flash of warmth, of sunlight, a world that seemed impossibly far away now.

Talon’s laughter rang in her ears, clear and bright. She could see him—his broad grin, carefree and full of life, as he pushed her through a field of wildflowers in that old, rusted wheelbarrow. The golden light of the afternoon sun had bathed them both, wrapping them in its warmth. **Hold on tight, Sari**, he had called out, his voice playful. She could still feel the way her heart had soared, light and free. She had laughed so hard her chest ached, the joy of the moment bursting inside her.

But that world was gone now—shattered like glass, the sharp edges of it cutting through her with every step she took. The memory flickered and faded, replaced by the cold, choking fog. Talon’s laugh echoed again in her mind, but this time it was wrong. Distorted. Warped by the weight of time and the Pulse. His voice, once a source of joy, now sounded hollow, like it didn’t belong to him anymore.

She forced herself to her feet, her legs trembling as she stood. She had to keep moving, had to press on. But the past clung to her like a shadow, refusing to let her go.

Her thoughts drifted to the **cabin**, the one they had dreamed of building together. In her mind, it still stood tall in the mountains, its wooden beams solid, the windows wide and open to the world outside. It had been their refuge—a place where they could escape the chaos, where they could build a life together. She could see it so clearly, as if it were just ahead, waiting for them to return. The cabin was more than just a home; it was a promise, a future they had once believed in.

But now, the cabin was nothing more than a ruin in her mind, crumbling under the weight of the Pulse. The beams had rotted, the windows shattered, the dream turned to dust. Yet, she couldn’t let go of it. If she could just find him, if she could bring Talon back, maybe they could rebuild it. Maybe they could reclaim what they had lost.

The forest whispered back to her, its voice threading through the trees like a mocking echo. *He’s gone. You’re alone.*

Sari’s heart clenched at the thought. She couldn’t accept that—not yet. Not while she still had hope, however small it was. Her fingers tightened around the small, worn **teddy bear** in her pocket, the one Talon had kept all those years. The fabric was frayed, the little hoodie she had embroidered now faded and old. It was such a small thing, but it was all she had left of him—the only thing that still felt real in a world that had been twisted beyond recognition.

She held onto it like a lifeline, her breath coming in ragged bursts as she forced herself forward, deeper into the forest. The fog seemed to close in around her, the trees bending and shifting, their forms warping at the edges of her vision. Shadows moved in the corners of her eyes, fleeting and insubstantial, as if the forest itself were alive, watching her every move.

*He’s gone. You’re alone.*

The voice echoed again, louder this time, as if the forest were mocking her. She pushed the thought away, but the weight of it pressed down on her chest, making it harder to breathe. She wasn’t alone. Not yet. Talon was still out there, somewhere, waiting for her.

But as she pressed on through the fog, the hope she clung to began to slip through her fingers, like sand in an hourglass running out of time.

**Chapter 1**

Sari stumbled through the forest, her breath coming in sharp, painful bursts. The air was thick with fog, heavy and damp, clinging to her skin like a second layer of flesh. The trees towered over her, their branches twisted and gnarled, clawing at the sky. Everything felt wrong. The ground beneath her feet was soft, too soft, as if the earth itself was sinking under the weight of the Pulse.

Her eyes scanned the dense underbrush, searching for movement, for any sign that Talon was still out there. But there was nothing—just the endless fog, pressing in on all sides, swallowing everything in its path.

She paused, her chest tight, and leaned against a tree, trying to catch her breath. Her heart pounded in her chest, the rhythmic thud echoing in her ears. The world felt so still, so quiet, and yet she knew the Pulse was near. It was always near. It was always watching.

A flicker of movement caught her eye, and she turned her head sharply, her pulse quickening. For a moment, she thought she saw him—Talon, standing at the edge of the forest, his tall figure blurred by the fog. Her breath caught in her throat, and for a heartbeat, hope flared in her chest. 

But as she blinked, the figure dissolved into shadow, disappearing into the mist. The hope that had sparked inside her was snuffed out just as quickly, leaving only the hollow ache of loss in its wake.

Talon had once been her anchor, her constant in a world that had always felt too chaotic. But now, he was nothing more than a ghost—an echo of the life they had built together, a life that was crumbling like the world around her. She felt the weight of it pressing down on her, crushing her beneath the memories of what they had been.

She pushed off the tree, forcing herself to keep moving. She couldn’t afford to stand still, not with the Pulse creeping closer. But as she walked, the memories followed her, clinging to her like shadows. **The cabin** loomed large in her mind, standing tall in the mountains, its wooden beams strong and sturdy. It had been their dream, their future. A place where they could escape, where they could build a life together—safe from the chaos, the noise, the world.

She could still see it so clearly. Talon had designed it with his usual precision—every line, every angle, perfect. It was a place where they could create, where they could breathe. Sari had imagined filling its rooms with her stories, her worlds. They had dreamed of growing old there, of watching the sun set behind the mountains every evening.

But that dream was gone now. The cabin was nothing more than a ruin, decayed and forgotten, just like everything else. The Pulse had taken it, taken everything. The thought of it, of the life they had once planned, gnawed at her, hollowing out her insides.

The forest around her felt oppressive, the trees leaning in closer, their twisted branches like skeletal fingers reaching for her. The fog seemed to pulse with a life of its own, shifting and swirling, distorting everything it touched. Shadows flickered at the edge of her vision, and every time she looked, they were gone.

A shiver ran down her spine, and she quickened her pace, her footsteps uneven as she stumbled over the uneven ground. The Pulse had warped everything—time, space, memory. Nothing was stable anymore. Nothing was safe.

Another flash of memory hit her, sharper this time. **The wheelbarrow**. Talon’s laugh, bright and carefree, as he pushed her through the field of wildflowers. She had screamed in delight, her hands gripping the edges of the rusted metal, her heart racing with the thrill of it all. **Hold on tight, Sari**, he had called, his voice full of joy. She had laughed so hard it hurt, the world spinning around her, bright and alive.

But that world was gone. The memory, once so clear, now felt distant, blurred at the edges, like a photograph left too long in the sun. His laugh echoed in her mind again, but it didn’t sound right. It was hollow, empty. Wrong.

She pushed the memory away, forcing herself to focus. She couldn’t afford to lose herself in the past. Not now. Not with the Pulse so close.

Her hand moved to her pocket, her fingers brushing against something small and familiar. The **teddy bear**. She had forgotten she still carried it with her. It was old, the fabric worn and frayed, the little hoodie she had embroidered for it faded and torn. Talon had kept it all those years, a silly reminder of their shared past. Now, it was the only thing left of him, the only part of their life that hadn’t been twisted by the Pulse.

She held onto it tightly, as if it could somehow anchor her to reality, to the life they had once shared. But even as she clung to it, the world around her felt like it was slipping further away, unraveling at the seams.

The cabin flashed through her mind again—only this time, it was different. The walls were sagging, the windows shattered. The roof had caved in, and the beams were splintered and rotting. It was no longer the safe haven they had dreamed of. It was a ruin, just like everything else the Pulse had touched.

Sari’s heart ached with the weight of it all. She had believed, once, that she could save Talon. That she could bring him back, fix what had been broken. But as the shadows closed in around her, as the Pulse crept closer, she wasn’t sure anymore. She wasn’t sure of anything.

Her breath quickened, her chest tight with panic. She had to find him. She had to believe that he was still out there, somewhere, waiting for her. But with every step she took, the hope that had once burned so brightly inside her began to flicker, fading into the fog like everything else.

**Chapter 2**

Sari’s feet sank into the mud as she trudged forward, the heavy, suffocating fog clinging to her skin like a living thing. The forest around her groaned, its trees bending under the weight of the Pulse. The branches stretched out like skeletal arms, creaking and shifting in the windless air. Everything was warped, twisted, and broken—just like the world she now found herself in.

Ahead, the outline of the **cabin** loomed, barely visible through the thick haze. Her heart lurched as she saw it, a visceral ache pulsing through her chest. This place… this was supposed to be their refuge, the home they had dreamed of building together, the life they had once imagined so vividly. But the cabin, like everything else, had been twisted by the Pulse.

She forced her legs to keep moving, though every step felt like a battle against the earth itself. The mud clung to her boots, pulling her down, as if the forest were trying to swallow her whole. The closer she got to the cabin, the more distorted it became. The walls sagged, leaning at unnatural angles, as if the very foundation had rotted away. The roof was caved in, the windows shattered, the beams splintered and broken. It wasn’t the cabin they had dreamed of. It was a shell of that dream, a hollowed-out reminder of everything they had lost.

Her throat tightened as the memories flooded her mind. Talon had designed the cabin with such precision, each line drawn with care, his mind crafting a sanctuary where they could escape the world. Sari had loved that about him—his steady hand, his focus. He had been so different from her, but that was what made them work. He kept her grounded, while she had pushed him to dream bigger, to let go of perfection just long enough to see the magic in the imperfection.

But now… now it was all gone.

The cabin stood before her, a ruin in the fog, like a monument to the life they could never have. Sari felt the weight of it pressing down on her, heavier than the mud dragging at her feet. The Pulse had taken it, twisted it, just as it had twisted Talon.

She stepped closer, her heart hammering in her chest as she reached for the door. The wood was damp and slick beneath her fingers, the surface warped and swollen from the relentless grip of the Pulse. She hesitated for a moment, her hand trembling as she rested it on the doorframe. The memories pressed in on her, vivid and bright.

---

They had stood here once, right where she was now, in this very spot. Talon had handed her the final sketch of the cabin, a smile tugging at his lips. **"What do you think?"** he had asked, his voice soft, full of hope. She had looked at the drawing, at the two tiny figures he had added—standing hand in hand in front of the house, their future etched in ink.

She had laughed, teasing him for his practicality. **"You’re really serious about this, aren’t you?"**

Talon had looked at her then, his expression sincere, unguarded in a way that had always made her heart ache. **"I am,"** he’d said. **"I want this with you."**

---

Sari clenched her jaw, her fingers digging into the warped wood. That dream was gone. The cabin was nothing more than a reminder of everything she had failed to hold onto.

With a deep breath, she pushed the door open. It groaned under the pressure, the hinges creaking, and she stepped inside. The air was thick with the stench of decay, a damp, earthy smell that turned her stomach. The inside of the cabin was worse than the outside. The floorboards were warped and rotting, patches of mold clinging to the walls like dark stains. The windows were cracked, the glass fogged over, hiding the world beyond.

Sari’s eyes scanned the room, her heart heavy with the weight of it all. This was supposed to be their haven, their sanctuary from the chaos. Instead, it had become a graveyard for their dreams.

---

A sound broke the silence—a faint creak, a rustle of movement from the far corner of the room. Her heart leaped into her throat, and she froze, her eyes darting toward the source. There, in the shadows, something shifted.

**"Talon?"** Her voice was barely a whisper, raw with emotion.

For a moment, there was nothing but the sound of her own breathing, the pulse of blood rushing in her ears. But then, slowly, a figure emerged from the darkness.

It was him. Or at least… it had been him once.

Talon stepped into the dim light filtering through the cracked windows, his face partially hidden by shadow. Sari’s breath caught in her throat. He looked… wrong. His posture was stiff, his movements jerky, unnatural. His eyes—those eyes she had once known so well—were empty, hollow. The man she had loved was gone, replaced by something else, something the Pulse had made.

Her heart ached as she took in the sight of him. This wasn’t Talon. Not really. This was a shell of the man she had known, twisted and broken by the same force that had taken everything else from them.

**"Talon?"** she repeated, her voice shaking.

But he didn’t respond. He didn’t even seem to recognize her. His gaze was vacant, distant, as if he were looking right through her.

Sari’s fingers tightened around the small **teddy bear** in her pocket, the fabric frayed and worn from years of being carried, being held. She had given it to Talon long ago, a silly little gift she had embroidered with his name. He had kept it all these years, just like she had kept the memory of who he used to be.

**"It’s me,"** she whispered, stepping closer. **"It’s Sari."**

For a fleeting moment, something flickered in his eyes—a spark of recognition, of something buried deep beneath the layers of corruption. But just as quickly, it was gone, swallowed by the Pulse.

He turned away from her, his movements slow and deliberate, as if he were fighting against something unseen. The Pulse. It had taken him, twisted him, just as it had twisted the world around them.

Sari’s chest tightened, tears burning at the edges of her vision. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. They were supposed to grow old together in this cabin, watch the sunsets, fill the rooms with stories and dreams. But now… now it was all gone. The cabin, their life, Talon. Everything had crumbled to dust.

**"Talon, please…"** Her voice cracked, desperation clawing at her throat. **"Come back to me."**

But he didn’t. He couldn’t. The Pulse had consumed him, just as it had consumed everything else.

Sari’s grip on the teddy bear tightened, her knuckles white. She had believed, for so long, that she could save him. That if she just kept fighting, if she just kept holding on, she could bring him back. But now, standing in the ruins of their dream, looking at the shell of the man she had loved, she wasn’t sure anymore.

---

The cabin groaned around her, the walls creaking as if the building itself was alive, twisted by the same force that had corrupted everything. Sari felt it too—the Pulse creeping into her mind, warping her memories, her thoughts. She wasn’t sure what was real anymore, what had been and what was.

But as she looked at Talon, standing in the shadow of the place they had once dreamed of building together, she knew one thing for certain.

She was losing him.

And there was nothing she could do to stop it.
