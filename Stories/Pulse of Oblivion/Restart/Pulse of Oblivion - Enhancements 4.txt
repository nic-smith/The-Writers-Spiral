To raise the rating back to 17 or 18 out of 20, here are specific changes you can make, with examples by chapter. These suggestions aim to improve pacing, character depth, and tension—elements that are crucial to bringing the story up to a higher level.

### **1. Improve the Story Opening (Chapter 1)**
   - **Current State**: The story sets the tone well but could use a more immediate, gripping hook.
   - **Change**: Start with an action or emotionally intense scene. For example, show Talon encountering the pulse immediately, either in a dream or a flash-forward. This would create immediate tension and curiosity, setting the stakes higher from the first page.
   - **Example**: Begin with Talon running through the decayed forest, sensing the pulse closing in, his breath ragged and his mind foggy. The scene should end with him waking up, revealing it as a prophetic dream tied to his weather obsession. This would immediately pull readers in.

### **2. Tighten Dialogue (Chapters 5, 7, and 10)**
   - **Current State**: Some dialogue feels too expository or heavy-handed, especially in moments where characters discuss the pulse.
   - **Change**: Add more subtlety to conversations. Characters should reveal their motivations and fears indirectly rather than stating them outright.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 5, instead of Jack explicitly talking about his need for control over the pulse, have him talk about a puzzle he’s solving. Through his obsession with solving it, he can hint at his desire for power without stating it directly. In Chapter 7, Dystiny could express her anxiety about the pulse through erratic actions, like aggressively coloring with her markers, rather than lengthy dialogue.

### **3. Deepen Character Quirks (Dystiny - Chapter 6, Talon - Chapter 3)**
   - **Current State**: Dystiny’s song lyric quirk and Talon’s weather obsession are mentioned but not consistently applied.
   - **Change**: Amplify these quirks throughout the story, using them to build character and add tension.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 6, when Dystiny is under stress, have her spout song lyrics in response to seemingly unrelated conversations. This could add depth to her emotional instability. Similarly, Talon should reference his barometer more frequently in moments of anxiety (Chapter 3), checking it obsessively even when there’s no apparent need.

### **4. Strengthen Emotional Stakes (Chapter 8)**
   - **Current State**: The emotional stakes are present but not fully realized.
   - **Change**: Bring more of the characters’ internal conflicts to the surface during tense moments, showing how the pulse affects their deepest fears.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 8, when Talon is faced with a critical decision about the pulse, have him remember his brother Tyler more vividly. Show how his failure to save Tyler still haunts him, and how the pulse represents another opportunity for redemption or failure. This will make the stakes feel more personal and immediate.

### **5. Increase the Tension in Key Scenes (Chapters 9 and 11)**
   - **Current State**: There are moments of tension, but the balance between tension and resolution could be improved.
   - **Change**: Extend the tension in key scenes before resolving it. Don’t resolve conflicts too quickly—let the characters feel the weight of their decisions.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 9, during the confrontation between Talon and Jack, let the scene play out longer, with each character pushing the other emotionally. Extend the buildup of suspense so the confrontation feels more explosive when it happens. Similarly, in Chapter 11, when the pulse begins to affect the environment, show the physical and mental strain on the characters in more detail before they take action.

### **6. Clarify the Pulse’s Influence (Chapter 12)**
   - **Current State**: The pulse’s influence is intriguing but could be explained more clearly in terms of its effect on each character.
   - **Change**: Make the pulse’s effects on each character more visible and tangible, both physically and psychologically.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 12, show how the pulse affects Talon, Dystiny, and Jack differently. For Talon, it might manifest as paranoia about the weather or control. For Dystiny, it could trigger a manic episode, heightening her creativity and anxiety. For Jack, it might feed his ego, making him feel invincible.

### **7. Reduce Exposition (Chapter 4 and Chapter 7)**
   - **Current State**: Some chapters are heavy on exposition, which slows down the pace.
   - **Change**: Cut back on exposition and trust the reader to piece together information through actions and dialogue.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 4, rather than explaining how the pulse works in great detail, let the characters experience it firsthand. Use visual and emotional cues to show its power. In Chapter 7, instead of a long dialogue explaining the town’s history, drop clues through Dystiny’s observations as she walks through the town, allowing the reader to infer the backstory.

### **8. Heighten the Climax (Chapter 13)**
   - **Current State**: The climax has impact, but it could be more intense and memorable.
   - **Change**: Increase the emotional and physical stakes in the final battle with the pulse. The characters should face more internal and external danger.
   - **Example**: In Chapter 13, as the pulse overwhelms the town, make the characters face their worst fears in a visceral way. Talon should feel the weight of every decision, seeing flashes of his past failures, while Jack becomes more manic in his pursuit of control. Extend the final confrontation so that victory feels more earned and difficult.

### Conclusion:
To increase the rating to 17 or 18 out of 20:
- Tighten and improve the pacing in key chapters.
- Amplify character quirks for consistency and depth.
- Raise emotional and physical stakes, especially in the climax.
