### **Profile of the Pulse**  
**Subject Codename**: **The Pulse**  
**Classification**: Anomalous Multi-Dimensional Energy Entity  
**Nature**: Non-terrestrial, Non-human, Potentially Sentient  
**Current Status**: Active

**Physical Characteristics**:
- The Pulse is an energy-based entity that exists outside conventional human perception. It does not have a physical form but manifests through distortions in time, space, and perception.
- It can manipulate gravitational fields, electromagnetic forces, and possibly quantum fields, suggesting its control over fundamental forces of the universe. In some cases, it may alter or manipulate reality itself, such as causing environmental shifts (e.g., flash floods, temperature changes) or even inducing gravitational inversions.
- The Pulse can interact with organic and inorganic matter, warping the physical environment and influencing living beings’ emotional and psychological states.

**Powers**:
- **Spatial Manipulation**: The Pulse can alter physical environments, creating anomalies such as sudden environmental changes, destruction of structures, and manipulation of natural forces like gravity and time.
- **Perceptual Manipulation**: It can distort individuals’ perceptions, causing hallucinations, time distortions, and the breakdown of the distinction between reality and illusion. This includes bending space and inducing hallucinations that affect all senses.
- **Mind Control & Influence**: The Pulse can directly affect the thoughts and emotions of individuals, particularly those who are emotionally vulnerable or psychologically compromised. It may induce fear, despair, and paranoia to destabilize human minds.
- **Environmental Influence**: The Pulse seems capable of manipulating weather and natural phenomena. This includes creating or intensifying storms, gravitational anomalies, and sudden bursts of energy that alter the physical environment.

**Sentience**:
- **Possibly Sentient**: While there is no conclusive evidence of the Pulse being self-aware, its behavior suggests a form of rudimentary consciousness. It reacts to external stimuli and adapts its methods based on the subjects it interacts with. However, it doesn’t seem to exhibit higher reasoning like humans—its consciousness, if it exists, may be alien in nature, more primal and instinct-driven.
- **Adaptive**: The Pulse demonstrates signs of learning from its interactions with humans and the environment, showing an ability to modify its behavior for maximum impact. It may have goals that we do not yet understand, but it tends to focus on survival and expansion of its influence.

**Personality**:
- The Pulse exhibits traits that could be described as **predatory** or **manipulative**, though it lacks traditional human emotions. It doesn’t exhibit malice or vengeance in a human sense but operates more like a force of nature, with intent and purpose. Its actions, however, often cause suffering, suggesting that it feeds off emotional energy, particularly fear and despair.
- **Unpredictable**: Its actions can be chaotic and difficult to predict, making it dangerous. In some cases, it may show curiosity by “toying” with subjects, while in other cases, it seems focused solely on causing destruction.

**Motivations**:
- **Survival**: The Pulse appears driven by a need to sustain itself, potentially by feeding off energy—whether psychic, emotional, or even gravitational. Its need to expand or maintain itself within our reality is a consistent behavior observed through decades of study.
- **Expansion**: Its influence grows steadily, suggesting that it seeks to multiply its reach. This could be part of its survival mechanism, as it seems to thrive by destabilizing environments and feeding on fear or emotional turmoil.

**Potential Origin**:
- Theories regarding its origin are varied, but the most likely explanation is that the Pulse is a **multi-dimensional entity** that either crossed into our reality through a tear in spacetime or was the byproduct of a catastrophic event (possibly an experiment gone wrong).
- It may have evolved in another dimension or reality where the laws of physics differ from our own. The Pulse’s abilities suggest it operates outside known scientific principles, leading some to speculate that it exists between dimensions or on a plane inaccessible to traditional human senses.

**Weaknesses**:
- The Pulse appears most vulnerable when it encounters strong, stable energy fields that disrupt its influence. There is evidence suggesting that **light**, **high-frequency sound**, or specific **electromagnetic frequencies** could interfere with its ability to manipulate environments or control individuals.
- **Emotionally resilient subjects**—individuals who maintain calm, rational thinking—seem to be less affected by the Pulse’s mind control and perceptual manipulations.

**Potential Threat**:
- The Pulse poses a significant risk due to its ability to manipulate both physical and psychological environments. Its influence can lead to mass hallucinations, environmental disasters, and the breakdown of human cognitive functions. The Pulse’s ability to create widespread destruction, chaos, and confusion makes it a high-priority threat.

### **30-Year History of the Pulse**

**First Recorded Incident (30 years ago)**:  
The earliest documented encounter with the Pulse occurred in a remote forested area of [Redacted], where several hikers went missing under mysterious circumstances. Search parties reported strange phenomena, including temperature drops, disorientation, and time loss. Survivors described feeling "watched" and "haunted" by a presence they could not see. These events marked the first significant investigation into what would later be called the Pulse.

**Phase 1 (30 to 25 years ago): Emergence & Localized Events**  
- Over the next five years, localized incidents of strange environmental changes and disappearances were reported in various remote locations. Witnesses described **sudden weather changes**, **hallucinations**, and **perceptual distortions**. Early hypotheses suggested natural causes, but the increasing pattern of anomalies led the FBI Paranormal Division to launch a formal investigation.
- Scientists posited that the Pulse might be a **natural force**, potentially caused by electromagnetic anomalies or gravitational waves. However, the Pulse’s growing ability to target individuals led to the abandonment of purely scientific explanations.

**Phase 2 (25 to 20 years ago): Escalation**  
- As the Pulse’s influence spread, **larger scale anomalies** began to occur. Forests, small towns, and rural areas started reporting **gravitational anomalies**, **mass hallucinations**, and even cases of **animal behavior disturbances**. In one town, a complete breakdown of social order occurred after individuals claimed to be under the direct influence of an invisible force.
- A team of scientists investigating the Pulse in [Redacted] disappeared without a trace. Their last communication described a "tearing in reality" and voices emanating from what seemed like another dimension. Following this, the Pulse was declared a **Class A Phenomenon**, indicating a severe threat level.

**Phase 3 (20 to 15 years ago): Containment Efforts & Failures**  
- Government containment efforts began, focused on **isolating areas** where the Pulse’s activity was highest. Military and scientific teams were dispatched to study the phenomenon in situ. Several attempts were made to disrupt the Pulse using **EMF pulses**, **high-intensity light**, and **sonic devices**, with varying degrees of success.
- However, it became clear that the Pulse was **adapting** to counter these measures. Reports indicated that the Pulse’s influence could extend beyond its original zones, suggesting it was learning or evolving.
- A key discovery during this period was that certain **emotionally resilient subjects**—such as trained soldiers or individuals with strong mental fortitude—were less affected by the Pulse’s manipulations.

**Phase 4 (15 to 10 years ago): Growth and Global Incidents**  
- The Pulse’s influence began to spread beyond localized regions. Reports of strange phenomena started appearing in **urban centers**, including **power outages**, **gravitational distortions**, and **psychological disturbances** in large populations. The Pulse seemed capable of affecting not only individuals but also **technology**, leading to widespread disruptions.
- Efforts to suppress public knowledge of the Pulse became more difficult as more high-profile incidents occurred. Notable events included the **gravitational collapse** of a skyscraper in [Redacted] and the mass disorientation of an entire population in [Redacted], where an entire city experienced hours of missing time.

**Phase 5 (10 to 5 years ago): Attempts at Understanding**  
- During this period, new theories about the Pulse emerged. Some researchers believed the Pulse was **extraterrestrial** in origin, while others suggested it was the result of a **quantum fluctuation** or a **tear in the fabric of spacetime**. Despite this, no concrete conclusions were reached.
- Experiments using **quantum detectors** and **tachyon interference** yielded strange results, furthering the belief that the Pulse operated outside our traditional understanding of reality.
- Reports also emerged that the Pulse was able to **amplify emotions**, particularly fear and despair, leading to theories that it may be feeding off psychic energy or emotional states.

**Phase 6 (5 years ago to Present): Present-Day Understanding & New Threats**  
- In the last five years, the Pulse has shown signs of further **evolution**. It seems capable of inducing **psychic breakdowns** in individuals exposed for long periods. Teams attempting to study the Pulse have suffered severe psychological trauma, with survivors reporting long-term effects such as paranoia, hallucinations, and dissociation from reality.
- The Pulse has continued to expand its reach, and containment is now considered a **global effort**. Governments worldwide are working in secret to suppress public awareness, though leaks have occurred, leading to **conspiracy theories** and fringe movements obsessed with the Pulse.
- There is growing concern that the Pulse may soon **destabilize global infrastructure** if left unchecked. It appears

 to be **gaining strength**, and its motivations, if it has any, remain unclear.
