**Preface**

The ground wasn’t solid anymore. It pulsed beneath Sari’s boots, warm and fleshy, like the earth itself was breathing. Every step felt like a misstep, like the ground was swallowing her whole. The fog pressed against her legs, thick and heavy, not just weighty, but purposeful, pulling her down, closer to the Pulse.

She gripped Talon’s pendant tighter, its sharp metal edges biting into her palm. **Talon.** His name anchored her, but even now, the Pulse was unspooling the threads that tied her to him. It whispered, unraveling her certainty. **You didn’t save him before. What makes you think you can now?**

The Pulse wasn’t just warping the forest—it was inside her, twisting her memories, bending them into something grotesque. She could see Talon’s face, but it didn’t look right. His eyes were empty, his smile crooked. **You left him behind. You let him fall.**

Her breath came in short gasps, panic rising. **No. I can still save him.** She repeated the thought over and over, but the words felt thinner each time, hollow and meaningless. **Or are you just trying to fix your own mistakes?**

She stopped, heart pounding, a memory flashing in her mind—**the last time she saw him**. His face was fading even then, his eyes filled with trust she knew she didn’t deserve. She had promised to keep him safe. **And you failed.**

Her stomach twisted. **What if it’s not him I’m saving? What if I’m just trying to prove to myself I’m not a failure?**

The fog tightened around her, thick and suffocating. **Talon.** Was he real? Or was he another illusion, another trick the Pulse had conjured? **If I stop, I’ll lose him. I’ll lose me.** But the Pulse whispered louder, taking on Talon’s voice. **Or maybe you’ve already lost him. Maybe you’ve lost yourself.**

Her chest tightened, doubt crawling into every part of her mind. **Talon.** His face was flickering, warping, twisted into something unrecognizable. **What if he’s already gone? What if I’m chasing a ghost?**

**Chapter 1: The Chase**

Sari ran.

The trees around her blurred, twisting and snapping from place to place, their branches bending at impossible angles. The Pulse wasn’t just behind her—it was inside her, twisting her thoughts, bending her memories. 

Her legs burned, her lungs ached, but she couldn’t stop. **If I stop, I’ll lose everything.** It wasn’t just Talon at risk—**it was her.** The Pulse wasn’t simply chasing her; it was pulling her apart, piece by piece.

Suddenly, a memory flashed—**Talon’s face**, but it wasn’t right. His eyes were hollow, his voice strained. **You let me go. You left me.** The words cut through her mind, sharp and clear, but they weren’t his. **They were hers.**

Her heart raced, her breath coming in ragged gasps. **I didn’t leave you. I’m trying to save you.** But the Pulse whispered louder, warping the memory until it no longer felt like hers. Now it was her voice, distant and fading, calling for help that never came. **You can’t save him. You’re not strong enough.**

Her legs trembled, her stomach turning. **Keep moving. Don’t let it take you.**

The fog wrapped tighter around her, pressing into her skin, pulling her deeper into its grip. Her emotions felt frayed, unstable. One moment, she felt a surge of hope, certain that she could still save Talon. But just as quickly, that hope twisted into something darker, heavier—a choking certainty that he was already gone. **You let him go. It’s your fault.**

Her breath hitched, her chest tightening with doubt. **Is it my fault? Did I let him slip away?** The Pulse whispered again, its voice taking on the shape of Talon’s, soft and accusing. **You failed me. You always fail.**

She stumbled, her foot catching on something that pulsed beneath her—was it a root? **No.** It moved, like a vein, throbbing with dark energy. **The Pulse is in the ground. It’s in me.**

Her vision blurred, her thoughts scattering like broken glass. **Talon’s face. His voice. His smile.** Was any of it real?

The fog pressed closer, suffocating her, and she heard his voice again, louder this time. **You’re not saving me. You’re running. You’re running from your own guilt.**

Her heart pounded, her legs shaking, but she pushed forward, the Pulse’s voice chasing her down, filling her head with doubt, with fear. **You’re already losing yourself.**

The cabin loomed suddenly in front of her, its dark windows staring back like hollow eyes. It was wrong—too close, too small—but it was the only thing left. **If I stop, I lose everything. I lose myself.**

She sprinted toward it, her breath coming in shallow, desperate bursts. **The Pulse was inside her now, feeding on her fear, twisting her emotions, pulling her apart.** Her hand slammed against the door, but it didn’t move. Panic surged in her chest, fast and hot, and she pounded on the door, her voice cracking. “Please... let me in!”

The Pulse pulsed again, stronger this time, sinking deeper into her thoughts, turning her memories into something dark, something unrecognizable. **You’ve already lost. You’re already gone.**

The door creaked open, and she stumbled inside, slamming it shut behind her. The cabin was cold, dark, but it felt solid. **Real.**

But the Pulse wasn’t outside anymore. **It’s inside me now.**

She slid down the door, her breath coming in shallow, uneven gasps. **How long before it takes everything?**

### **Chapter 2: The Cabin**

The cabin stood at the edge of the clearing, a stark contrast to the fog-drenched forest that surrounded it. It was exactly as she remembered, but there was something wrong—something off. The air inside was heavy, thick with an oppressive energy that clung to her skin. The walls seemed to pulse in time with her own heartbeat, as though the Pulse had seeped into the very bones of the place.

Sari stepped inside, her breath catching in her throat. This had been their safe haven once—a place where they could escape the world and lose themselves in their art. She could still see the remnants of their lives here. The sketches on the walls, the half-finished stories scattered across the table. Talon’s drawings—beautiful and chaotic—hung like ghosts in the air. 

But now, the cabin felt like a tomb.

The weight of the Pulse was stronger here, its presence undeniable. It had corrupted everything, even the memories she had clung to. Sari’s gaze fell on the mantle, where a **clock** stood, its hands frozen in place. 

It wasn’t just frozen. Time itself felt different here—warped, distorted. She could feel it in her bones, in the way the air seemed to still around her, trapping her in a moment that refused to move forward.

Sari reached for the clock, her fingers trembling. Before she could touch it, the hands jerked forward, spinning wildly before stopping again, locked in place.

Time had no meaning here. The Pulse had taken control.

And then she saw him.

Talon stood by the window, his back to her, his silhouette familiar but distant. His shoulders were hunched, his head tilted as though he was listening to something only he could hear. 

Sari’s heart twisted in her chest. **Talon.**

“Talon?” Her voice was barely a whisper.

He didn’t move.

She took a step closer, her heart pounding. “Talon, please… it’s me.”

For a moment, he turned, just enough for her to see his face. There was a flicker of recognition in his eyes—a brief, fleeting moment where he was **himself** again. But it was gone as quickly as it had come.

“Don’t,” he whispered, his voice distant, **warped**. “Don’t let it win.”

The temperature in the room plummeted, a sudden, sharp cold that took her breath away. She could see her breath fog in the air, but she barely noticed it. All she could see was Talon—or what was left of him.

The Pulse had consumed him, twisted him into something unrecognizable. The man she loved was slipping away, and she was powerless to stop it.

Sari’s chest tightened, the weight of it crushing her. She had come all this way, fought so hard, but for what? To lose him to this… thing?

But she couldn’t give up. Not yet. Not when there was still a chance—no matter how small—that she could bring him back.

### **Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

The forest felt heavier now, the fog thicker and more oppressive than before. Every step was a battle against the Pulse’s growing influence. It pulsed through the ground, through the trees, through her bones, making it hard to tell what was real and what was just a product of the Pulse’s manipulation.

Sari stumbled forward, her breath coming in ragged gasps, her legs trembling beneath her. She was close now. She could feel it.

A **shadow** flickered in the distance, just at the edge of her vision. She froze, her heart pounding in her chest. The figure was there, but when she blinked, it

 was gone, swallowed by the fog.

The feeling of being watched pressed down on her, suffocating. The forest was alive, and it was watching her, waiting.

She took another step, her eyes scanning the trees, searching for any sign of Talon. But all she saw were shadows—shadows that moved when they shouldn’t have, shapes that twisted and flickered in the fog.

The Pulse was playing with her, twisting reality, bending the world around her. She could feel it gnawing at the edges of her mind, trying to break her, to make her doubt everything she knew.

And then she saw him.

Talon stood at the edge of the clearing, his back to her. His body was rigid, his movements slow and unnatural. The Pulse had taken him deeper now, twisted him into something barely recognizable.

“Talon,” she called out, her voice trembling.

He didn’t turn.

She took a step closer, but the ground beneath her shifted suddenly, a **pulse of energy** rippling through the earth. The trees around her groaned, their branches creaking under the weight of the Pulse’s power.

“Talon, please… I’m here.”

This time, he turned. But when he spoke, his voice was no longer his own. It was **distorted**, a low, guttural sound that sent chills down her spine.

“Sari… you can’t… save me.”
