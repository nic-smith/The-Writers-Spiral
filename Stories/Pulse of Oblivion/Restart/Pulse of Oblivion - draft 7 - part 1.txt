**Chapter 1: The Pulse Begins**

Talon ran through the streets of Brookridge, his breath ragged, the soles of his boots slamming against the cracked pavement. The town twisted around him, the buildings warping into grotesque shapes, their windows like gaping mouths that whispered his name.

*Run,* they seemed to hiss. *You can’t outrun it. You never could.*

Above him, the sky burned red, streaked with violent shades of crimson, casting the world in an otherworldly glow. He couldn’t make sense of it—how the streets he knew so well had become this hellish landscape—but it didn’t matter. The pulse was coming, and it was closing in fast.

He could feel it beneath his feet, a faint tremor in the earth at first, but growing stronger, more erratic with every step. The ground throbbed, like the heartbeat of some ancient, malevolent force. Each beat reverberated through his bones, syncing with his own pulse until it felt like his chest was on the verge of exploding.

The pulse was alive. And it was hungry.

Talon’s heart raced as he skidded to a stop in the middle of the town square. It was empty—unnaturally still—but the air crackled with tension, thick and heavy, pressing down on him. He looked around, panic rising in his throat. Where was everyone?

Then he saw him.

Standing at the edge of the square, half-hidden in the shadows of the warped trees, was his younger brother, Tyler.

Talon’s heart lurched.

Tyler hadn’t changed. He was still twelve years old, wearing the same faded red hoodie he had worn the day he disappeared in the woods. His wide, terrified eyes locked onto Talon’s, pleading, desperate.

*Talon…* Tyler’s lips didn’t move, but Talon heard his voice clear as day, echoing in his mind.

“No,” Talon whispered, his throat tight, hands trembling at his sides. “You’re not real. This isn’t real.”

But Tyler didn’t move. He just stood there, staring with those wide eyes, frozen in time. Just like that day. The day Talon couldn’t save him.

Talon took a step forward, his legs heavy, as if the earth itself was pulling him down. “Tyler, please…”

The pulse surged.

The ground beneath Talon cracked, a jagged fissure ripping through the earth, splitting the town square in two. The sky groaned, and a low, thunderous roar echoed from somewhere deep below. Talon stumbled, falling to his knees as the ground trembled violently.

Tyler was slipping away, the fissure widening between them, swallowing the shadows and creeping toward his brother. Talon scrambled to his feet, reaching out desperately, but Tyler’s form began to flicker, his body dissolving into the darkness.

“No! Tyler!”

With a blinding flash, the world collapsed.

Talon woke with a gasp, bolting upright in his bed, drenched in sweat. His heart pounded wildly in his chest, the echo of the pulse still throbbing in his ears. For a moment, he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move, the weight of the dream pressing down on him.

Then his hand found it—his barometer, sitting on the nightstand beside him. He gripped it tightly, feeling the cool metal against his skin, grounding him in reality. The pulse was gone. It had only been a dream. But the fear—the dread—lingered, gnawing at the edges of his mind.

He glanced at the window. The night outside was calm, the sky dark and still, but the tension in the air hadn’t faded. Talon knew that dream wasn’t just a dream.

The pulse was real. And it was coming.

**Chapter 2: Unsettling Changes **

The pulse didn’t stop. If anything, it grew more insistent as the night wore on, a steady, rhythmic thrum that seemed to pulse not just through the ground but through the air itself. By the time morning came, the town of Brookridge felt different—off-kilter in a way that Talon couldn’t put into words.

The sky was a pale, sickly color, too bright for the early hour, and the air was unnervingly still, as though the world itself was holding its breath. Talon rubbed his eyes and glanced at the barometer again, but the needle hadn’t budged. It was stuck, as if refusing to acknowledge what was happening.

Throwing on his jacket, he stepped outside. The pulse was still there, vibrating beneath his boots, a low hum that seemed to reverberate through his bones. It was growing stronger, more pronounced, but the town remained eerily quiet.

The town square, usually buzzing with morning activity, was deserted. No one was heading to the market, and the children who would normally be playing near the fountain were nowhere to be seen. The silence was heavy, unnatural. Talon felt it under his skin, an itch he couldn’t scratch.

Across the square, Sari stood at the door of her shop, her eyes unfocused as if she were miles away. She’d been awake all night, plagued by strange, vivid dreams that left her feeling as though she’d been somewhere else entirely—places she’d never been but could somehow almost remember. The pulse had been there too, whispering to her, pulling her deeper into the recesses of her own mind.

Talon approached her cautiously. “It’s worse,” he said, his voice barely louder than a whisper.

Sari didn’t look at him. She was still staring at the horizon, her hand absently brushing her hair out of her face. “I don’t know what’s happening, Talon. I feel... wrong. Like something’s inside me. I didn’t sleep at all. And the dreams... they don’t even feel like mine.”

Talon clenched his jaw. “I had them too. So did Dystiny.”

Sari shuddered, her arms wrapping tightly around herself. “This isn’t just us. It’s the whole town. It’s like... like the pulse is inside us now, not just outside.”

Just as she finished speaking, a low growl echoed from the alley behind her shop. Talon’s muscles tensed. He motioned for Sari to stay back as he crept toward the sound, his hand instinctively hovering over the knife at his belt.

What he saw made his stomach drop.

A stray dog, its fur matted and its eyes wild, staggered out of the shadows. Its movements were jerky, erratic, as if it were being pulled by invisible strings. Its mouth hung open, saliva dripping from its jaw, and its body convulsed with every step, as though the pulse had burrowed inside it, warping its very being.

“Jesus,” Talon muttered, backing away slowly.

The dog froze, its head snapping up to lock eyes with him. For a moment, they stood in tense silence, the pulse drumming louder and louder in Talon’s ears. The dog’s eyes, bloodshot and glazed, looked through him as if it didn’t recognize the world around it. Then, without warning, the dog bolted, disappearing into the shadows with a speed that defied its previous sluggishness.

Talon turned back to Sari, his face pale. “It’s affecting animals too,” he said quietly.

Sari swallowed hard, her hands trembling. “What do we do?”

“We find out where it’s coming from,” Talon replied, his voice firm, though inside, his heart was racing.

---

Dystiny was already awake when they arrived at her apartment. She hadn’t slept either. The pulse had taken root in her mind, filling it with fragmented images and flashes of half-formed thoughts that seemed to make no sense. She hadn’t been able to concentrate on anything except the ever-present hum, which was now a constant in her life, louder than her own heartbeat.

When she opened the door to Talon and Sari, her eyes were wide, manic. “You feel it too,” she said without preamble. It wasn’t a question.

Talon nodded. “We need to figure out what’s going on. It’s getting worse.”

Dystiny laughed, a short, sharp sound that held no humor. “Getting worse? It’s already broken everything. The pulse is... it’s inside me. I can’t think straight. I keep seeing things. Colors, shapes, memories that aren’t mine.” She gestured vaguely to the walls of her apartment, where her frantic drawings had taken over, neon lines crisscrossing haphazardly as though she had been trying to map the chaos inside her mind. “It’s like it’s in everything now. Not just the ground. Not just the air.”

Sari stepped forward, her voice soft with concern. “Dystiny, we’re all feeling it, but we have to stay focused. We need to understand what this thing is.”

“I’m *trying*,” Dystiny snapped, her hands shaking. “But it’s too much. Every time I close my eyes, I see... things. Things that don’t make sense.”

Talon folded his arms. “We’re all having the same dreams. This isn’t just coincidence. Whatever the pulse is, it’s in our heads now. It’s trying to tell us something—or control us.”

Dystiny’s manic energy seemed to falter for a moment. “Control us?” she whispered. “What does it want?”

Talon shook his head. “We don’t know yet. But we need to find out.”

Before anyone could respond, a loud crash echoed from outside. The three of them rushed to the window, their breath catching as they saw a group of people gathered in the town square. It wasn’t the usual morning crowd. They were shouting, pushing, their faces pale with fear. In the middle of the square, two men were grappling with each other, their movements frantic and violent. The rest of the crowd stood frozen, watching in stunned silence.

“It’s affecting them too,” Sari whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon’s expression hardened. “We need to get them inside before this gets worse.”

Dystiny grabbed her coat and followed them outside. As they approached the square, the scene became clearer. The pulse had intensified, warping people’s emotions, twisting their fears until they turned on each other. Some were shouting about divine punishment, others about government conspiracies, their voices frantic with desperation.

At the center of the chaos stood **Pastor Nathan**, his arms raised as if in prayer, trying to calm the crowd. But even from a distance, Talon could see the strain on his face, the cracks in his calm exterior.

“This is a test!” Pastor Nathan’s voice rang out over the din, his tone filled with conviction. “We must not give in to fear! The Lord is with us!”

But the crowd wasn’t listening. The pulse’s grip was too strong, feeding on their panic and uncertainty, turning the town square into a boiling pot of confusion and chaos.

Talon, Sari, and Dystiny pushed through the mass of bodies, trying to reach Pastor Nathan. “Father!” Sari called out, grabbing his arm. “We need to get everyone inside. It’s not safe out here.”

Pastor Nathan turned to her, his eyes wild with a mixture of fear and determination. “This is judgment, Sari. The pulse... it’s testing our faith.”

“No,” Talon interrupted, his voice sharp. “This isn’t divine. It’s in our heads. You can feel it, can’t you?”

The pastor shook his head stubbornly. “I refuse to believe that. The Lord does not abandon us in times of need.”

Before they could argue further, a piercing scream cut through the air. The crowd parted, revealing a woman stumbling forward, her hands covered in blood. Behind her, a man lay motionless on the ground, his head twisted at an unnatural angle.

The pulse had claimed its first victim.

For a moment, everything went silent. Then the square erupted into chaos.

Sari grabbed Dystiny’s arm, pulling her toward the safety of her shop. “We need to go!”

Talon’s mind raced as the pulse surged through him, almost deafening now. Whatever was happening to Brookridge, this was only the beginning.

---

**Chapter 3: The First Expedition**

The pulse hadn’t let up. If anything, it had only grown stronger, more insistent. By the time the sun rose, a heavy fog clung to the ground, as if the earth itself was trying to smother whatever malevolent force had taken root beneath Brookridge. It was early, too early for anyone to be awake, yet Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Pastor Nathan found themselves gathered at the edge of the woods.

No one had spoken much since the incident in the square. The sight of the dead man had left a mark on all of them. Talon could still see his lifeless eyes staring into nothingness, his face frozen in a twisted scream. The memory gnawed at him, making the pulse’s rhythm seem louder, as if it were pulsing directly in his skull.

“We shouldn’t be here,” Sari whispered, pulling her coat tighter against the morning chill. Her breath hung in the air, lingering longer than it should have. “Not without a plan.”

Talon frowned but didn’t argue. She was right, but they had to do something. Waiting wasn’t an option anymore. “We need to figure out where this thing is coming from,” he said. “We’re running out of time.”

Pastor Nathan shifted uneasily, his gaze fixed on the fog-shrouded trees. He hadn’t been the same since last night. His faith had wavered, if only for a moment, and that doubt gnawed at him just as much as the pulse did. But he wouldn’t let it show. He had to stay strong, for their sake.

“We’re not alone in this,” Nathan said softly, his voice quieter than usual. “God is still with us, even if it feels... distant.”

Dystiny snorted but said nothing. She’d stopped arguing with Nathan’s insistence on divine intervention after the incident in the square. What good would it do? The pulse was far beyond anything human or divine. It was something else entirely.

Talon took the lead, his flashlight cutting a narrow path through the fog. The woods were unnervingly quiet, the usual sounds of birds and rustling leaves replaced by an oppressive silence. Each step felt heavier than the last, as though the ground itself resisted them. The pulse throbbed beneath their feet, more than just a sound now—it was a presence, coiled tight in the air, pressing down on them with invisible weight.

Dystiny trailed behind, her hand trailing along the trunks of the trees as if grounding herself. “It’s getting louder,” she murmured. “It’s pulling us.”

Talon glanced over his shoulder at her, his brow furrowed. “Pulling us where?”

She didn’t respond, but the far-off look in her eyes told him she knew something. Or maybe it was just the pulse messing with her head. It was hard to tell anymore. He didn’t trust his own thoughts either.

Sari suddenly stopped short, her eyes narrowing at something on the ground. “Wait.” She knelt, brushing aside the fallen leaves to reveal strange markings etched into the earth. They were faint, barely visible, but unmistakable.

“What is it?” Nathan asked, his hand resting on the worn leather of his Bible as if it could offer some protection from whatever they were about to face.

Sari traced the markings with her finger. “It’s old. Really old. These don’t look natural.”

Talon crouched beside her, his eyes scanning the symbols. He couldn’t make sense of them, but they felt wrong, like they didn’t belong here. He pressed his hand against the ground, half-expecting it to pulse beneath his palm, but all he felt was cold dirt.

“These are ancient,” Dystiny muttered from behind them. Her voice was distant, almost hollow. “This isn’t the first time something like this has happened.”

Talon looked up at her sharply. “What do you mean?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her eyes were glazed over, staring at the markings as though they were speaking to her in some language only she could understand. “The pulse... it’s been here before. Maybe not here, exactly, but somewhere. It’s been waiting. Waiting for someone to disturb it.”

Sari exchanged a glance with Talon, her face pale. “Disturb it? How?”

Dystiny’s lips twitched into a faint smile, but it wasn’t one of joy. It was bitter. “We woke it up. All of us. We didn’t even know we were doing it, but now it’s awake. And it’s hungry.”

Nathan’s hand tightened on his Bible. “This is madness,” he muttered, but there was no conviction in his voice.

Talon stood, dusting off his hands. “Madness or not, it’s real. And if this thing has been here for centuries, we need to find out why. Maybe these markings can lead us to the source.”

Sari rose to her feet, casting a wary glance at the trees surrounding them. The fog seemed thicker now, as if closing in around them. “Do you think it’s... alive?” she asked quietly. “The pulse, I mean. It feels like it has intent.”

Talon didn’t know how to answer that. It certainly felt alive, like it was watching them, waiting for the right moment to strike. But could something like this really have intent? Or was it just a force of nature, as indifferent to them as a storm or an earthquake?

“We keep moving,” he said, his voice hardening. “The sooner we figure out what’s going on, the sooner we can stop it.”

Nathan, Sari, and Dystiny fell in behind him as they continued deeper into the woods. The fog swirled around their feet, and the pulse grew louder with each step, a constant pressure against their minds. It was getting harder to think, harder to focus on anything but the thrum of energy that seemed to fill the air.

Dystiny stumbled suddenly, her hand flying to her head. “It’s too much,” she gasped. “It’s... it’s in my head.”

Talon grabbed her arm, steadying her. “Stay with me,” he said, though the pulse was starting to worm its way into his own thoughts, whispering things he couldn’t quite make out. “We’re almost there.”

“Almost where?” Nathan asked, his voice strained. “How do we even know where we’re going?”

Talon didn’t have an answer for that either. He was following instinct now, something deep in his gut telling him they were on the right path. Or maybe it wasn’t instinct. Maybe it was the pulse.

As they trudged on, the ground began to change beneath their feet. The earth was softer here, more pliable, and the trees loomed taller, their trunks twisted into unnatural shapes. The air felt heavier, thick with moisture, and the pulse was almost deafening now, a steady beat that drowned out everything else.

And then they saw it.

A clearing in the trees, bathed in a strange, flickering light. At the center of the clearing stood an ancient stone altar, weathered by time but still intact. The markings on the ground led straight to it, glowing faintly in the dim light.

“This is it,” Dystiny whispered, her voice trembling. “This is where it started.”

Nathan crossed himself instinctively, his face pale. “What is this place?”

Talon approached the altar cautiously, his heart pounding in his chest. The pulse was stronger here, almost unbearable, but he forced himself to keep moving. As he neared the altar, he could see strange symbols etched into the stone, similar to the ones they had found in the forest. But these were clearer, more deliberate, like they were meant to be seen.

“This isn’t just an altar,” Talon murmured. “It’s a trigger. This is what woke the pulse.”

Dystiny shuddered, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to leave. Now.”

But Talon couldn’t move. His hand hovered above the stone, drawn to it like a magnet. He could feel the pulse thrumming through the air, calling to him, pulling him closer.

“We have to stop it,” Sari said, her voice trembling. “We have to destroy it.”

Talon’s fingers brushed the surface of the stone, and the pulse surged through him, filling him with a blinding light.

---

**Chapter 4: Disappearance**

The sky hung heavy over Brookridge, a slate gray mass that seemed to trap the town beneath its weight. It was quiet again, the stillness broken only by the faint, ever-present hum of the pulse. Talon, Sari, and Dystiny returned from the woods in silence, the weight of their discovery pressing down on their shoulders like a secret too dark to share.

Talon had barely slept. Every time he closed his eyes, flashes of light, twisted shapes, and echoes of that unnatural energy from the object haunted him. He’d wake in a cold sweat, the pulse thrumming beneath his skin, reminding him that it was still out there, waiting.

The others weren’t faring much better. Sari sat in her shop, staring blankly at the postcards she had once cherished. The images of serene beaches and quiet countryside villages now seemed alien, as if they belonged to a world far removed from their own. Her hands trembled as she tried to arrange them, but she couldn’t focus. Her mind kept drifting back to the clearing, to the moment when Talon had touched the object.

Dystiny, for her part, was quiet. Too quiet. She sat at the diner, nursing a cup of coffee she didn’t drink, her markers forgotten in her bag. Every so often, her fingers would twitch as if reaching for them, but she never pulled them out. The pulse echoed in her head, louder now, a drumbeat that wouldn’t let up.

“What do we do now?” Sari had asked them when they parted ways after returning to town. But no one had an answer. Not yet.

***

The day passed in a haze, time slipping by in a way that felt wrong. Hours bled into one another, and by the time the sun began to set, Talon realized he had barely moved from his spot by the window. He stared out at the empty street, waiting. For what, he didn’t know.

When the knock came at his door, it startled him out of his trance. He stood, his muscles stiff, and opened it to find Sari standing there, pale and wide-eyed.

“Talon,” she said, her voice thin, almost fragile. “Something’s wrong.”

He didn’t need to ask what. He could see it in her face.

“It’s Dystiny,” Sari continued, wringing her hands. “She’s gone.”

Talon’s stomach dropped. “Gone? What do you mean, gone?”

“She... she went back to the woods,” Sari whispered. “I went to check on her at the diner, but no one’s seen her since this afternoon. I found her jacket in the clearing.”

Talon’s mind raced. “Why would she go back? We agreed we wouldn’t...”

Sari shook her head, tears brimming in her eyes. “I don’t know. But something’s wrong. I can feel it.”

The pulse throbbed louder, as if mocking them. Talon grabbed his coat and nodded to Sari. “Let’s go.”

***

The woods were darker now, the shadows longer, the trees seeming to close in on them as they made their way to the clearing. The pulse had grown stronger here, its rhythm almost erratic, as if the object was waking up. The wind rustled the leaves, but there was no sound beyond that—no birds, no animals, just the pulse and the creaking of branches.

“Do you see anything?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon shook his head. His eyes scanned the treeline, searching for any sign of Dystiny. But there was nothing. No movement. No sound. Only the pulse, louder now, vibrating through the ground beneath their feet.

Then, they saw it.

In the center of the clearing, where the object had been half-buried in the earth, there was a disturbance. The ground looked... wrong. Warped, as if something had pushed its way out from underneath. The pulse was deafening here, a constant thrum that made Talon’s head ache.

Sari stepped forward cautiously, her breath coming in shallow gasps. “Talon... what happened?”

He didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the spot where the object had been. It was gone.

The earth had swallowed it—or it had moved. Either way, it wasn’t there anymore. And Dystiny was nowhere to be found.

“Dystiny!” Sari called out, her voice trembling.

No answer. Just the pulse, pounding in Talon’s skull.

“We need to go,” he said, grabbing Sari’s arm. “Now.”

“But what about Dystiny?” Sari’s voice was laced with desperation.

Talon clenched his jaw. “She’s not here. And whatever took her... we’re not equipped to handle it.”

They turned to leave, but before they could take more than a few steps, the air around them shifted. Talon froze, his body tensing as a strange sensation washed over him—a distortion, like the fabric of reality itself had been twisted. Time seemed to stutter, the trees flickering in and out of focus, their edges blurring.

“Talon, what’s happening?” Sari’s voice was barely audible over the pulse, which had become a cacophony of sound, crashing through their minds like a tidal wave.

Talon’s vision swam, and for a moment, he wasn’t sure if he was standing in the woods or somewhere else entirely. The trees flickered again, replaced by ghostly afterimages—shadows of places he didn’t recognize. And then, just as quickly as it had started, the distortion stopped.

The woods returned to normal, the pulse fading back to its familiar rhythm. Talon blinked, trying to steady himself. Sari was beside him, her face pale and drawn, her breath coming in quick gasps.

“Did you... did you see that?” she asked, her voice shaky.

Talon nodded, swallowing hard. “Yeah. I saw it.”

The pulse had done something to the fabric of reality. He didn’t know how or why, but he could feel it. Time had bent, flickered, leaving them disoriented and unsure of what was real.

And Dystiny was still gone.

***

The walk back to town was a blur. Talon’s mind raced, his thoughts tangled with questions he couldn’t answer. Dystiny had vanished—taken by the pulse, or by whatever force was behind it. The object had moved, or disappeared entirely, leaving only chaos in its wake.

When they reached the town square, the air was thick with tension. People were gathered in small clusters, their faces pale, eyes wide with fear. They had felt it too—the distortion, the pulse growing stronger. Whispers of missing time, ghostly images, and lost hours rippled through the crowd like wildfire.

Talon and Sari pushed their way through the throng, heading straight for Father Nathan, who stood at the steps of the church, his brow furrowed in concern.

“You felt it, didn’t you?” Talon asked as they approached.

Father Nathan nodded, his face grim. “I did. The pulse... it’s growing more powerful. People are reporting strange things—lost time, visions of places that don’t exist.”

Sari’s voice wavered. “Dystiny’s gone. We went to the clearing, and she wasn’t there. The object... it’s moved, or disappeared. Something’s happening out there, and it’s getting worse.”

Father Nathan looked down, his hands gripping his rosary tightly. “The Lord is testing us. But we must stay strong. Dystiny... we will find her. We must keep our faith.”

Talon clenched his fists, frustration bubbling inside him. Faith wasn’t enough. Not now. Not when the pulse was tearing reality apart. But he bit back his words, knowing they wouldn’t help. Father Nathan was doing what he could, but they needed more than prayers.

They needed answers.

As the night deepened, the pulse continued, its grip tightening on the town. Talon knew that whatever had taken Dystiny wasn’t finished. This was only the beginning.

And soon, the pulse would demand more.

---

**Chapter 5: Panic in Town**

By the time they returned to Brookridge, the town had descended into chaos. The pulse wasn’t just a hum in the background anymore. It was everywhere, rattling windows, making the ground tremble with each beat. It was like the very air had taken on a life of its own, pressing down on the townspeople, warping their senses.

The square was packed with people, most of them yelling or arguing, their voices blending into an overwhelming cacophony. It was impossible to tell where one argument ended and another began. The pulse had amplified everything—their fears, their doubts, their anger—and now, it was boiling over.

Talon stopped at the edge of the square, his eyes scanning the crowd. The pulse buzzed in his skull, louder here than it had been in the woods. It was hard to focus, hard to think. He could feel it gnawing at him, fraying the edges of his thoughts, trying to pull him into the madness.

Sari stood beside him, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to get them inside,” she said, her voice barely audible over the noise. “It’s not safe out here.”

He nodded but didn’t move. Part of him wondered if there was anywhere safe left in Brookridge. The pulse had its claws in everyone now. He could see it in the way people moved, the way they spoke—jerky, erratic, their eyes darting around as if searching for something they couldn’t find.

At the center of the square, **Pastor Nathan** stood on the steps of St. Joseph’s Church, his arms raised in an attempt to calm the crowd. His voice rang out over the din, loud and firm, but there was a tremor in his words, a hint of doubt that hadn’t been there before.

“Everyone, please!” Nathan shouted, his voice cracking slightly. “We must stay calm! This is a test of faith!”

But the crowd wasn’t listening. The pulse had made sure of that. Their fear and confusion were too strong, too overwhelming. It fed on their emotions, twisting them, warping them until reason no longer had a place here.

Talon pushed through the mass of bodies, his heart pounding as the pulse throbbed louder in his ears. He could feel it trying to push him over the edge, trying to make him lose control. But he fought against it, forcing himself to focus.

“Nathan!” he shouted, finally reaching the pastor. “This isn’t helping. We need to get these people inside!”

Nathan turned toward him, his face pale, sweat beading on his forehead. For a moment, he looked lost, as though he didn’t recognize Talon at all. Then his eyes cleared, and he shook his head. “We can’t just hide, Talon. We need to stand firm. The Lord is testing us.”

Talon clenched his fists, frustration bubbling up inside him. “This isn’t a test, Nathan. This is something else—something we don’t understand. The pulse isn’t divine. It’s a force, and it’s tearing this town apart.”

Nathan’s eyes hardened, his grip tightening on the worn leather of his Bible. “You’ve lost your way, Talon. You need to have faith.”

Talon opened his mouth to argue, but before he could say anything, a woman’s scream pierced the air. The crowd parted, revealing a young mother clutching her child, her face twisted in terror. The little boy in her arms was limp, his eyes wide and unblinking.

“He’s not breathing!” she sobbed, shaking the boy frantically. “Someone, please help!”

Nathan rushed forward, pushing through the crowd to reach her. He placed a hand on the boy’s forehead, whispering a quiet prayer. But the pulse pulsed harder, deeper, making the ground quake beneath their feet. The boy’s eyes fluttered, his chest heaving, but the strange rhythm continued.

The pulse was inside him too.

“We need to get him inside!” Nathan barked, his voice full of desperation now. “We can’t lose him!”

Talon and Sari helped carry the boy toward the church, but the crowd wasn’t moving anymore. People stood frozen in place, their eyes wide with fear, their breaths shallow. Some murmured to themselves, others trembled. The pulse had wrapped its tendrils around each one of them, pulling them deeper into their own madness.

As they reached the steps of the church, Talon looked back over the square. He could see the fear growing in everyone’s eyes, see how the pulse was feeding on it, growing stronger with each heartbeat. The longer they waited, the worse it would get.

Inside the church, the air was cooler, quieter. The stone walls seemed to muffle the pulse’s presence, though it was still there, lurking just beneath the surface. Nathan laid the boy down on a pew, his hands trembling as he continued to pray over him.

Talon paced back and forth, his mind racing. “We can’t stay here. The pulse is getting stronger, and it’s feeding on them—on all of us.”

Sari sat down beside the boy, her face pale. “What are we supposed to do, Talon? We don’t even know what this thing is, or how to stop it.”

Dystiny appeared in the doorway, her eyes wild, her breath coming in short, rapid gasps. “We don’t stop it,” she said, her voice trembling. “We can’t stop it.”

Nathan looked up sharply. “What do you mean? There’s always a way. The Lord will provide.”

But Dystiny shook her head, her hands shaking as she clutched the doorframe for support. “It’s too strong. It’s inside us now. It’s... it’s changing us. Can’t you feel it?”

Nathan frowned, but his eyes flickered with uncertainty. “No. We’re stronger than this. We have to be.”

“We’re not,” Dystiny snapped, her voice rising. “This isn’t just fear or doubt. The pulse is in our heads. It’s twisting our thoughts, feeding on our emotions. It wants us to tear each other apart.”

Talon stopped pacing, his heart sinking as her words hit home. He had felt it too—the way the pulse had wormed its way into his mind, whispering things he couldn’t quite make out. It was subtle, but it was there, always there, nudging him toward something darker.

“We need to leave,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We can’t stay in town. Not while this thing is getting stronger.”

Nathan stood, his jaw set in determination. “We can’t just abandon the people, Talon. They need us.”

“They need us alive,” Sari interjected, her voice quiet but resolute. “We won’t be any help to them if we’re dead or worse.”

The church fell into a tense silence as Nathan weighed his options. The pulse continued to beat, steady and unrelenting, a constant reminder of the threat closing in on them. Finally, Nathan exhaled, his shoulders sagging in defeat.

“Fine,” he muttered, “but we can’t leave everyone here. We’ll take as many as we can.”

Talon nodded, though he knew it wouldn’t be enough. They couldn’t save everyone. The pulse was too strong, too far-reaching. But they had to try.

As they prepared to leave, the church doors slammed open, and a group of people from the square burst inside, their faces twisted in fear and desperation. They swarmed toward Nathan, their hands reaching out as they begged for answers, for salvation.

“Please, Pastor!” a man cried, his voice shaking. “You have to help us! You have to stop this!”

Nathan hesitated, glancing back at Talon. His eyes were filled with uncertainty, but he couldn’t turn them away. Not now.

“We’ll do what we can,” Nathan said, though the words sounded hollow, even to him.

The pulse throbbed again, louder this time, shaking the very foundation of the church. Dust fell from the rafters, and the crowd recoiled in terror.

Talon gritted his teeth, his hand tightening on the knife at his belt. “We need to move. Now.”

As they began herding the townspeople toward the back of the church, the pulse surged again, more powerful than ever before. It wasn’t just a sound anymore—it was a force, an overwhelming pressure that seemed to wrap around them, squeezing tighter with every second.

Talon could feel it closing in, pulling them toward something darker, something they couldn’t see but knew was there, waiting.

And the worst part was, it wasn’t just out there.

It was inside them too.

Here’s a rewritten version of **Chapter 6**, where we can amplify Dystiny’s song lyric quirk and Talon’s weather obsession to build tension and add depth to their characters:

### **Chapter 6: Fraying Edges**

The wind howled through the trees, and the air felt dense, charged with something that wasn’t quite natural. Talon kept glancing down at his barometer, even though he knew it didn’t matter. The needle hovered in the middle, unmoved by the strange energy around them. He clicked it open and shut repeatedly, a nervous habit he couldn’t seem to shake. The barometer was an anchor in a world that felt increasingly out of control.

But right now, everything was off balance.

Ahead of him, Dystiny’s pace was erratic, her steps uneven. She hummed to herself, a melody that Talon couldn’t place, but it felt off-key, almost frantic. Her hands fidgeted with the straps of her backpack, her fingers tapping a jittery rhythm. 

“We should’ve brought more supplies,” she muttered suddenly, her voice rising and falling with anxiety. “We’re not prepared for this. We don’t know what the pulse will do next.”

Talon looked up from his barometer, his brow furrowed. “We’ll manage. We have enough to get by for now.”

Dystiny ignored him, her mind already spiraling down a path he couldn’t follow. She let out a breathless laugh, shaking her head as if to clear it. “*Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone,*” she mumbled under her breath, the words barely audible but unmistakable. 

Talon’s chest tightened. He had heard her do this before—sing lyrics in times of stress, as if the songs were her only way of grounding herself. The more anxious she became, the more fragmented her lyrics would get. It wasn’t a good sign.

“Dystiny, focus,” Talon urged, quickening his pace to catch up to her. “The pulse is playing tricks on all of us. We can’t afford to get lost in our heads right now.”

She stopped abruptly, her hands gripping her backpack straps tightly as she stared ahead at the forest, her face tense. “*Where did you sleep last night?*” she sang softly, her voice wavering. “*In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines…*”

Talon swallowed hard. Her song was unraveling, just like her thoughts. He knew she wasn’t hearing him anymore, wasn’t fully present. She was slipping away, inch by inch, into whatever dark place the pulse was pushing her toward.

“We need to find cover before nightfall,” Talon said, his voice firmer now. “We’re not going to survive out here if we don’t keep moving.”

Dystiny blinked, her gaze shifting to him as if noticing him for the first time. For a moment, there was a flicker of recognition in her eyes, but it was quickly swallowed by the same distant, haunted look.

“Do you hear that?” she whispered, her body tensing. Her hand moved to her head, fingers threading through her hair. “It’s like… the pulse is inside me. Like it’s pulling on something. *Hello darkness, my old friend…*”

Talon stepped closer, his heart racing. He couldn’t let her slip away. Not now. Not when they were so close to finding answers.

“Dystiny, you have to stay with me,” he said, his voice low but urgent. “The pulse is feeding off your fear. It’s twisting things in your head. That’s how it works. You’re stronger than this.”

She shook her head, her hands trembling as she pressed them against her temples. “No. It’s not just in my head. It’s everywhere. I can feel it, Talon. Like it’s crawling under my skin. *You can’t always get what you want…*”

Talon’s jaw tightened. He had seen this before—the way the pulse got into people’s minds, how it distorted everything they knew, feeding on their deepest insecurities. Dystiny was unraveling, and the pulse was pulling the threads.

He glanced down at his barometer again, clicking it open and shut, as if the act could somehow keep him grounded, keep his thoughts clear. The needle hadn’t moved, and yet the pressure in the air felt suffocating, like the atmosphere was thickening with every step they took.

“We’re going to get through this,” Talon said, though the words felt hollow in the oppressive air. “We’ve faced worse.”

Dystiny’s laugh was sharp, brittle. “*You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,*” she sang softly, her voice laced with something close to desperation. “But there’s no sun, Talon. Not here. Not now.”

Talon gritted his teeth. He couldn’t argue with her—not when the world around them seemed to be shifting, warping under the pulse’s influence. The sky was still gray, thick with clouds that never seemed to part, and the forest ahead felt darker, more foreboding with every passing minute.

He had to keep her tethered. Had to keep her focused.

“You’re not alone in this,” Talon said, his voice steady but tense. “We’ll find a way through, but you have to stay present. You can’t let the pulse take that from you.”

Dystiny’s gaze flicked toward him again, and this time there was a sliver of clarity in her eyes, a faint recognition of his words. Her lips parted, as if she wanted to speak, but instead, another lyric escaped her—quieter, more fragile. “*I can’t help falling in love with you…*”

Talon took a deep breath, forcing his own rising fear down. He could feel the pulse too—its heavy, rhythmic beat thrumming in the distance, growing louder in his chest. It was trying to break them down, inch by inch, playing on their weaknesses.

But he wasn’t going to let it win.

“Come on,” he said, his voice more commanding now. “We need to keep moving. The pulse is trying to break us, but we won’t let it. Not today.”

Dystiny blinked, her fingers loosening their grip on her backpack straps. She nodded once, her lips pressed tightly together. She wasn’t fully present, but she was trying. Trying to hold on.

And for now, that was enough.

### Key Changes:
1. **Amplified Dystiny’s Quirk**: Her stress manifests through song lyrics that become more fragmented and frantic as her anxiety grows. This shows how the pulse is affecting her emotionally, unraveling her thoughts.
   
2. **Talon’s Weather Obsession**: His fixation on the barometer becomes a recurring behavior, showing his need for control in an environment that is rapidly slipping away from him.

3. **Tension through Actions and Dialogue**: Dystiny’s escalating anxiety and Talon’s attempts to ground her increase the tension, with subtle shifts in their behavior reflecting the pulse’s growing influence.

**Chapter 7: Reality Fractures**

By the time the sun set again, Brookridge felt like a place suspended between two worlds. The pulse had warped reality, twisting the very air, bending time and space until nothing felt solid anymore. The streets stretched out in ways that shouldn’t have been possible, the buildings casting long, distorted shadows across the ground. 

Talon felt it the moment he stepped outside. The town didn’t look right—angles were sharper, colors too vivid, as if someone had turned the saturation up on the entire world. The pulse wasn’t just a vibration beneath the earth anymore. It was in everything: the trees, the houses, the sky. It was inside them too, whispering at the edges of their minds, pushing them toward the brink.

He tightened his grip on the flashlight, casting its beam into the unnatural darkness. The streets were empty, but not silent. Every so often, he’d catch a glimpse of something moving just out of sight—a shadow that darted too quickly to be real, a whisper of sound that disappeared as soon as he focused on it.

Behind him, Sari and Dystiny followed closely, their faces pale and drawn. None of them had slept in over 24 hours. The pulse had seen to that. It didn’t allow for rest anymore. Whenever they closed their eyes, it was there, waiting, pulling them into strange, fragmented dreams that felt more like memories than figments of imagination. 

Dystiny rubbed her temples, her steps slowing. “It’s warping everything,” she muttered, her voice barely audible over the constant hum. “I can’t... I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”

Sari glanced at her, worry etched into her features. “We’re still here, Dyst. Stay with us.”

“I’m trying,” Dystiny whispered, but her voice sounded distant, as if she were already slipping away.

Talon stopped at the corner of the street, his eyes scanning the darkness. He could feel the pulse more strongly now, pressing against his mind, making it harder to think, harder to focus. “We need to get to the church,” he said, though even that plan felt tenuous now. The church had once been a refuge, but how long would that last with the pulse growing stronger by the hour?

They made their way through the distorted streets, the pulse echoing in their heads like a heartbeat that wasn’t their own. Talon could feel it, crawling through his thoughts, twisting them, making him question everything he saw. The shadows seemed to lengthen with every step, the buildings looming over them like giants, watching, waiting.

Finally, they reached St. Joseph’s, the doors still open, beckoning them inside. Pastor Nathan stood in the entryway, his face pale and gaunt, the weight of his doubt written in every line of his body. He didn’t say anything as they approached, just stepped aside to let them pass.

Inside, the church was dimly lit, candles flickering on the altar. The pulse was quieter here, but not gone. It lurked in the corners, a steady thrum just beneath the surface, waiting for its moment to strike.

Talon collapsed onto one of the pews, rubbing his temples. His head felt like it was being squeezed in a vice, the pressure unbearable. “This is getting worse,” he muttered. “I don’t know how much more of this we can take.”

Nathan sat down beside him, his Bible clutched tightly in his hands. “It’s testing us,” he said, though there was little conviction in his voice. “We have to stay strong.”

Talon glanced at him, exhaustion clouding his vision. “It’s not a test, Nathan. It’s not divine. It’s... something else.”

Nathan didn’t respond. He just stared straight ahead, his fingers tracing the worn leather of his Bible, his lips moving in a silent prayer. 

Sari sat across from them, her eyes fixed on the door. “Do you think it’s... changing us?” she asked quietly. “I mean, really changing us. Not just in our heads.”

Talon frowned, but before he could answer, Dystiny spoke up from the back of the church, her voice a trembling whisper. “It is.”

They turned to see her standing near the altar, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She was shaking, her eyes wide with fear. “I’ve been seeing things. Things that shouldn’t be there. Memories that aren’t mine.”

Nathan stood abruptly, his face pale. “What do you mean?”

Dystiny shook her head, her breath coming in short, rapid gasps. “It’s not just warping the town. It’s warping us. Our minds, our memories. I’m seeing... I’m seeing things from years ago. Things I’ve never experienced. But they feel real.”

Talon exchanged a glance with Sari, his stomach twisting in unease. The pulse was doing more than just distorting reality—it was digging into their minds, pulling out pieces that didn’t belong, blurring the line between what was real and what wasn’t.

“We need to figure out how to stop it,” Talon said, though the words felt hollow. How could they stop something like this? Something that was everywhere and nowhere at once, something that had seeped into their very being?

Before anyone could respond, the pulse surged again, stronger than before. The candles flickered wildly, the air thickening with a pressure so intense it felt like the walls themselves were closing in. Talon gasped, clutching his head as the pulse bore down on him, pressing into his skull with relentless force.

Dystiny collapsed to her knees, her hands gripping the edge of the altar. “It’s too strong!” she cried, her voice strained. “It’s... it’s inside me!”

Nathan rushed to her side, but Talon knew there was nothing they could do. The pulse was feeding on them, twisting their thoughts, pulling them further into its grasp. It wasn’t just a force anymore—it was a presence, alive and malevolent, and it wasn’t going to stop until it had consumed them completely.

The room spun as the pulse grew louder, drowning out everything else. Talon’s vision blurred, his thoughts fracturing under the weight of it all. He could feel it pressing deeper into his mind, twisting his memories, making him question everything he knew. Was this real? Was any of it real?

He staggered to his feet, barely able to stay upright as the pulse surged again, shaking the very foundation of the church. The walls seemed to warp, bending inward as the pulse tried to crush them, to break them.

Nathan stood, his voice rising above the chaos. “We can’t give in!” he shouted, though his voice trembled with fear. “We have to hold on!”

But Talon could barely hear him anymore. The pulse had taken over everything, drowning out all sound, all thought. It was in his head, pulling him down into a darkness that had no end.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the pulse stopped.

The pressure lifted, the air clearing as if nothing had happened. Talon collapsed onto the floor, gasping for breath, his heart pounding in his chest. His mind was still reeling, the edges of his thoughts frayed and tattered, but for the first time in what felt like days, the world seemed still.

Nathan helped him to his feet, his face pale but determined. “We need to find the source,” he said quietly. “Before it starts again.”

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure how much more they could take. The pulse had pushed them to their limits, fractured their reality, and now, it was only a matter of time before it returned, stronger than ever.

**Chapter 8: The Underground Discovery**

The descent into the earth was slow and treacherous. The narrow path twisted and turned, the walls pressing in on all sides, as if the earth itself was trying to swallow them whole. The deeper they went, the colder the air became, until it felt like they were walking into the belly of a beast. The pulse was louder here, no longer a faint vibration beneath their feet but a living, breathing thing, thrumming through the stone, echoing off the walls.

Talon led the way, his flashlight cutting through the darkness. Behind him, Sari followed closely, clutching a rope tied to her waist, her face pale but determined. Jack and Dystiny brought up the rear, their eyes darting around as if they expected the walls to close in on them at any moment.

“We’re close,” Jack whispered, his voice barely audible over the steady beat of the pulse. “I can feel it.”

Talon glanced back at him, his jaw tight. He could feel it too—something was drawing them deeper, pulling them toward the heart of the pulse. The air around them was thick with tension, every step heavier than the last. It felt as if time itself was bending, warping around them, making it impossible to know how long they had been walking.

Sari stumbled slightly, catching herself against the wall. “This place... it feels wrong.”

Talon nodded, his eyes scanning the darkness ahead. “We’re not supposed to be here.”

Jack slowed his pace, his hand brushing the stone wall beside him. “It’s ancient. I don’t think anyone has been down here for centuries.”

Dystiny shivered, pulling her coat tighter around her. “Maybe there’s a reason no one’s been down here.”

Talon didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. They all knew that whatever they were walking into, it was far older and far more dangerous than they could imagine.

After what felt like an eternity, the tunnel finally opened up into a vast underground chamber. Talon’s breath caught in his throat as his flashlight illuminated the space. It was massive, the ceiling soaring high above them, the walls carved with strange symbols that seemed to shimmer in the light.

At the center of the chamber stood a large stone structure, half-buried in the ground. It pulsed with energy, the same rhythmic beat that had haunted them for days, only now it was stronger—so strong that Talon could feel it vibrating through his bones.

“This is it,” Jack whispered, stepping forward. His eyes were wide with a mix of awe and fear. “This is the source.”

Talon approached the stone structure cautiously, his flashlight casting long shadows across the floor. The closer he got, the more he could feel the pulse pressing against him, like a physical weight. He reached out, his fingers brushing the surface of the stone. It was cold, but it thrummed with life, like a heartbeat.

“It’s alive,” Sari whispered, her eyes wide as she took in the strange carvings on the walls. “This whole place... it’s part of something bigger.”

Talon stepped back, his heart pounding. “We need to figure out what this is—what it’s doing to the town.”

Dystiny approached the stone, her hands trembling. “It’s not just doing something to the town. It’s doing something to us. I can feel it... pulling at me.”

Jack moved closer to the stone, his hand tracing the symbols carved into its surface. “These symbols... they’re ancient. I don’t recognize the language, but it’s like they’re... alive.”

Talon’s stomach churned as he looked around the chamber. The walls seemed to shimmer, as if they were shifting, warping in and out of focus. The pulse was getting stronger, its rhythm pounding in his ears.

“What do we do?” Sari asked, her voice trembling.

“We destroy it,” Talon said, his voice steady despite the fear clawing at his chest. “We can’t let this thing keep feeding on us.”

Jack shook his head, his eyes wide. “You can’t destroy it. This isn’t just a piece of rock. It’s part of something much larger—something we can’t even begin to understand.”

Talon turned to him, his fists clenched. “If we don’t destroy it, it’s going to destroy us. You’ve seen what it’s doing to the town.”

Before Jack could respond, the pulse surged, sending a shockwave through the chamber. Talon staggered, nearly losing his balance as the ground trembled beneath his feet. The walls shimmered violently, and for a brief moment, the chamber flickered—reality bending and warping around them.

When the world snapped back into focus, Talon’s breath caught in his throat. The chamber hadn’t changed, but something was different—something was watching them. He could feel it, a presence lurking just beyond the edge of his perception, waiting.

“We’re not alone,” Dystiny whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon scanned the darkness, his flashlight shaking in his hand. “What is it?”

“I don’t know,” Dystiny said, her eyes wide with fear. “But it’s... watching us.”

The pulse throbbed again, and Talon felt a cold sweat break out across his skin. The air around them seemed to ripple, and suddenly, shadows began to move along the walls, twisting and writhing like living things.

Sari gasped, stumbling back. “What is that?”

Talon’s heart raced as the shadows coalesced into vague shapes—figures that flickered in and out of existence, like ghosts caught between worlds. They weren’t human. They weren’t even alive, but they were watching, their eyes fixed on the group with a cold, hungry gaze.

“We need to get out of here,” Talon said, his voice tight. “Now.”

Jack shook his head, his eyes glued to the stone structure. “No... we’re too close. We need to understand what this is—”

Another shockwave hit, stronger this time. The ground cracked beneath their feet, and the pulse roared through the chamber, deafening. The shadows surged forward, their forms twisting and flickering, and for the briefest moment, Talon saw faces—faces twisted with agony, their mouths open in silent screams.

Sari screamed, grabbing Talon’s arm. “We have to go!”

But Talon couldn’t move. The pulse was too strong, pulling at him, dragging him toward the stone. It was like gravity, drawing him in, whispering to him, promising him answers if only he would let go.

“Talon!” Sari’s voice cut through the fog in his mind, and he blinked, shaking off the haze.

“Go!” Talon shouted, wrenching himself away from the stone. “Get out of here!”

They ran, the pulse pounding in their ears, the shadows chasing them, growing stronger with each step. The walls of the chamber warped and twisted, reality buckling under the weight of the pulse.

The tunnel loomed ahead, and they scrambled toward it, their breaths coming in ragged gasps. As they reached the entrance, Talon risked a glance back.

The shadows had stopped at the edge of the chamber, writhing and flickering, unable to follow. But the pulse... the pulse was growing louder, angrier, as if it had been denied something it desperately wanted.

They stumbled out of the tunnel, collapsing onto the ground, gasping for breath. The night air was cold and sharp, a stark contrast to the suffocating atmosphere underground.

Talon sat up, his heart pounding in his chest. They had found the source of the pulse—but they hadn’t destroyed it. And now it knew they were there.

“It’s only going to get worse,” Jack said, his voice hoarse. “It’s waking up.”

Talon clenched his fists, his jaw tight. “Then we need to figure out how to stop it—for good.”

Dystiny, still trembling from the ordeal, nodded. “Before it destroys us all.”

The pulse throbbed beneath them, a reminder that time was running out. Brookridge was on the edge of oblivion, and if they didn’t stop the pulse soon, it would consume everything.

---

 **Chapter 9: Descent into Control**

The pulse thrummed louder with each passing second, the erratic beats crawling under Talon’s skin, vibrating through his chest. It was as though the ground beneath them was alive, pulsating with a malevolent energy that whispered insidiously to each of them.

Talon’s fists were clenched, his breath uneven. He tried to keep his focus, but the air was thick with the pulse’s influence, like a storm building just out of sight, waiting to tear them apart.

Jack stood a few feet away, his back to Talon, staring at the pulse’s source—the stone structure that glowed faintly, casting an eerie light over the chamber. His hands twitched at his sides, fingers trembling as if itching to reach out and touch the power emanating from the stone.

“Jack,” Talon called out, his voice tight, strained. “We need to stop this. We can’t let the pulse keep feeding on us. It’s already too strong.”

Jack didn’t turn around. His body was still, but Talon could sense the tension radiating off him in waves. There was something wrong in the way Jack’s shoulders hunched, the way his breathing had become shallow, rapid, like he was on the edge of something dangerous.

“You don’t understand,” Jack muttered, his voice low, barely audible over the pulse’s rhythm. “You’ve never understood.”

Talon took a cautious step forward, keeping his voice steady. “What don’t I understand? Talk to me, Jack.”

Jack laughed softly, a sound devoid of humor, and turned slowly to face him. His eyes gleamed in the dim light, wild and manic, but there was something darker lurking beneath the surface. His lips twisted into a bitter smile.

“The pulse… it’s not what you think it is,” Jack said, his voice trembling with a strange mixture of fear and desire. “It’s not just some mindless force. It’s power. Raw, unimaginable power. And it’s been waiting for us.”

Talon’s heart skipped a beat, unease creeping through him like a chill. He had seen Jack like this before—obsessive, desperate for control—but never like this. The pulse was feeding on him, twisting his thoughts, warping his insecurities into something dangerous.

“You’re wrong,” Talon said firmly, his voice laced with urgency. “The pulse is feeding on us, Jack. It’s manipulating you, using your fears against you. We have to stop it before it destroys everything.”

“Destroy it?” Jack’s laugh was sharp, bitter. He took a step toward Talon, his eyes wide and burning with something unhinged. “You still don’t see it, do you? The pulse isn’t something to be feared—it’s something we can control. Something I can control.”

Talon’s pulse quickened. Jack’s voice was filled with a dark, fervent conviction, like he truly believed what he was saying. The pulse had its claws deep in him, warping his every thought, feeding off his need for control.

“You can’t control it, Jack,” Talon said, his voice tight with desperation. “It’s using you. It’s turning your fears, your need for control, into something dangerous. If we don’t stop it now, it’ll consume you.”

“Consume me?” Jack’s eyes flashed with defiance, and for a moment, Talon thought he saw a flicker of something darker—something that wasn’t entirely Jack. “You think I’m afraid of that? I’m not afraid anymore, Talon. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have power—real power. The pulse isn’t trying to destroy me. It’s offering me something no one else ever has. Control.”

Talon shook his head, his stomach churning. He had to get through to him before it was too late, before Jack fell too far into the pulse’s grasp.

“Jack, listen to me,” Talon said, stepping closer, his voice low but urgent. “This isn’t about control. The pulse isn’t offering you anything. It’s taking from you. Look at what it’s already done. You’re not yourself anymore.”

Jack’s face twisted, his lips pulling back in a snarl. “You’re the one who’s not yourself, Talon. You’re too scared to see the truth. The pulse isn’t the enemy—it’s the answer. We’ve spent our whole lives running from things we can’t control, from the fear that we’ll lose everything. But the pulse… it can change that. It can make us stronger.”

Talon’s chest tightened. He could see it now—the pulse’s influence wrapped around Jack like invisible chains, dragging him deeper into its control. And yet, Jack’s desperation for power was so palpable, so raw, that Talon couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy.

“We’re stronger without it,” Talon said quietly, his voice barely more than a whisper. “You’re stronger without it.”

Jack’s eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Talon thought he might have gotten through. But then Jack’s face hardened, and he took a step back, his hand reaching out toward the glowing stone structure.

“No,” Jack said, his voice cold, final. “I’m done being weak. I’m done being afraid.”

“Jack—” Talon lunged forward, his heart pounding, but it was too late.

Jack’s hand made contact with the stone.

The chamber exploded in a blinding flash of light, the pulse surging through the air like a violent storm. Talon was thrown back, crashing to the ground as the pulse’s energy whipped through the room, wild and erratic. The air crackled with power, and Talon could barely breathe, the pulse hammering in his chest like a second heartbeat.

When the light finally faded, Talon pushed himself up, his vision swimming. Jack stood in front of the stone structure, his body convulsing as the pulse’s energy coursed through him. His face was twisted in pain, but there was something else in his eyes—something dark, something that wasn’t human.

“Jack…” Talon whispered, horror creeping into his voice.

But Jack didn’t respond. His body jerked violently, the pulse’s power writhing beneath his skin, twisting him from the inside out. And then, with a sickening crack, Jack crumpled to the ground, his body limp and lifeless.

Talon stared in shock, his heart pounding in his chest. The pulse had consumed him. It had taken Jack, just like it had been trying to take them all.

The chamber was silent now, the pulse’s rhythm slowing to a steady, almost contented beat. Talon staggered to his feet, his legs weak, his mind reeling.

He had failed.

**Chapter 10: The Pulse’s Growth**

The pulse had spread beyond Brookridge. By morning, strange phenomena were being reported in the surrounding towns—animals behaving erratically, objects moving on their own, and people experiencing vivid hallucinations. Talon knew time was running out. Whatever force they had awakened beneath the earth was growing stronger, its influence seeping out of the town like a dark cloud, corrupting everything in its path.

They stood at the edge of the woods, the early morning mist hanging low over the ground. Sari clutched Amelia’s crumpled map in her hands, her eyes scanning the simple lines and symbols drawn with a child’s hand. The map seemed to lead deeper into the underground chamber, to a place they hadn’t yet explored. A place where answers might be waiting.

“We have to go back,” Talon said, his voice resolute. He stared at the entrance to the underground tunnel, the weight of the decision heavy in his chest. Every instinct told him to run, to get as far away from the pulse as possible. But running wasn’t an option. The pulse was spreading, and if they didn’t stop it now, it would consume everything.

Sari nodded, her face pale but determined. “We know what we’re dealing with now. We have to stop it.”

Jack stood a few steps away, his hands trembling as he clutched his flashlight. His face was gaunt, his eyes sunken with exhaustion. The pulse had taken its toll on him, warping his brilliant mind into a tangled mess of fear and confusion. But even in his broken state, there was still a flicker of determination in his eyes.

“I’ve been thinking,” Jack said quietly, his voice shaky. “The pulse isn’t just alive—it’s sentient. It’s learning, growing. Every time we interact with it, it changes. And now it’s growing beyond the town. We need to figure out what it wants, or we won’t be able to stop it.”

Dystiny, who had been silent for most of the morning, finally spoke up. “What if we’re too late? What if it’s already spread too far?”

Talon clenched his fists. “We can’t think like that. We’ve seen what the pulse can do—it warps reality, traps people in loops, feeds on fear and memories. But it hasn’t won yet. There’s still time.”

Father Nathan had insisted on joining them, despite his earlier reservations. He stood beside Sari, his face drawn and weary, but his eyes were filled with a grim determination. “Faith is what will guide us through this,” he said softly. “Even in the face of this darkness, we must hold onto hope.”

Talon didn’t know if faith would be enough, but he appreciated the priest’s resolve. They needed every ounce of strength they could muster. The pulse was growing stronger by the hour, and they were running out of options.

“Let’s go,” Talon said, leading the way into the tunnel.

***

The descent into the underground chamber felt different this time. The pulse was louder, its rhythm more erratic, like the beating of a heart pushed to the brink of collapse. The walls seemed to shimmer with energy, the strange symbols carved into the stone glowing faintly in the dim light of their flashlights.

Sari walked beside Talon, holding the map tightly in her hand. “The map leads deeper,” she said quietly. “There’s a section we missed, a part of the chamber we didn’t explore.”

“Do you think that’s where the core of the pulse is?” Talon asked, his voice low.

“I don’t know,” Sari admitted. “But it feels right. Like we’re being guided there.”

The group moved cautiously through the chamber, their footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. The pulse thrummed beneath them, vibrating through the stone, making the air around them feel thick and heavy. Talon could feel the weight of it pressing down on him, like a storm about to break.

As they ventured deeper into the chamber, the walls seemed to pulse with light, the symbols glowing brighter with each step they took. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, the pulse matching the rhythm of his own heartbeat. He could feel it now—an insistent tug, pulling him toward something. Toward the source.

“There,” Jack whispered, pointing ahead.

In the center of the chamber, half-buried in the ground, was a massive stone structure. It was different from the one they had seen before. Larger, more intricate. The symbols carved into its surface seemed to writhe and twist, alive with energy.

The pulse was stronger here, almost deafening. Talon could feel it vibrating through his bones, making his skin prickle with static.

“We’ve found it,” Sari breathed, her eyes wide with awe and fear.

“This is the core,” Jack said, his voice trembling. “This is where the pulse is coming from.”

Talon stepped forward cautiously, his eyes locked on the stone structure. It thrummed with power, the pulse radiating from it like a living thing. He could feel it pulling at him, whispering in the back of his mind, promising him answers—if only he would give in.

“What do we do?” Dystiny asked, her voice barely audible.

“We stop it,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We destroy it.”

“How?” Sari asked, her eyes wide. “We don’t even know what it is.”

Before Talon could answer, the pulse surged, and the ground beneath their feet trembled violently. The walls of the chamber warped and twisted, and the air around them seemed to crackle with electricity. Talon staggered, catching himself against the stone wall.

“What’s happening?” Dystiny cried, panic rising in her voice.

“The pulse,” Jack gasped. “It’s fighting back.”

The ground shook again, harder this time, and cracks began to form in the stone beneath their feet. Talon’s heart raced as the pulse throbbed louder, its rhythm erratic and wild. It was like the pulse was alive, struggling against them, trying to protect itself.

“We have to destroy it now,” Talon shouted, his voice barely audible over the deafening roar of the pulse. “If we don’t, it’s going to consume everything!”

“But how?” Sari cried, her eyes filled with fear.

Talon stared at the stone structure, his mind racing. There had to be a way. The pulse was alive, sentient, but it was vulnerable. It fed on fear, on memories, on their darkest thoughts. But it was also bound to this place—this core.

Then it hit him.

“The pulse is tied to us,” Talon said, his voice steady despite the chaos around them. “It’s feeding on us—on our memories, our fears, our guilt. That’s how it’s growing stronger.”

“We’ve seen it,” Jack added, his voice trembling. “It warps reality, traps people in loops, makes them relive their worst moments. It’s using our minds against us.”

Talon took a deep breath. “Then we need to starve it. We need to take away its power.”

Father Nathan frowned, his hand tightening around his rosary. “And how do we do that?”

“We cut ourselves off,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We have to confront the things it’s feeding on—the fears, the memories, the guilt. We have to face them and let them go.”

Sari’s eyes widened. “You mean... we have to make peace with it?”

Talon nodded. “If we don’t, the pulse will keep feeding on us, and it’ll keep growing stronger. But if we can cut off its food source, we can weaken it. Maybe even destroy it.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his face resolute. “Then let us begin.”

The pulse throbbed louder, its rhythm chaotic and wild, but Talon felt a strange calm settle over him. He knew what they had to do now. They had to face the darkness within themselves, confront the memories and fears the pulse had twisted and used against them.

One by one, they gathered around the stone structure, closing their eyes as the pulse washed over them. The air crackled with energy, and the chamber seemed to warp around them, but they stood firm, bracing themselves for what was to come.

The pulse was about to reveal their darkest truths.

And if they didn’t confront them, the pulse would consume them all.
