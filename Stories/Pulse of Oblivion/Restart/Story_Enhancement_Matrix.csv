Story Section,Current Version,Proposed Change
Opening,"The pulse is introduced immediately, described as a powerful, overwhelming force affecting everything.","Introduce the pulse more subtly, using sensory descriptions like 'The air itself seemed to tighten... a low, rhythmic hum' to build suspense before naming the threat."
Pastor Character Development,"The pastor clutches his rosary, and his faith is described in very outward, ritualistic ways.","Change the pastor’s actions to more subtle internal struggles. For example, he runs his thumb along a Bible, questioning where God is in all of this."
Pulse Descriptions,"The pulse is frequently described using the same words, and it is mostly mentioned as a sound or vibration.","Vary the descriptions, referring to the pulse as 'the heartbeat of the earth,' 'an unseen force,' or 'a pressure seeping into their bones' to avoid repetition."
Dialogue,'I don't know if God is with us.' - direct and on-the-nose.,"Introduce subtext: 'Sometimes I wonder if we’ve been forsaken, but I can’t say it aloud when they’re all looking to me for answers.'"
Conflict,"Characters feel afraid, but this fear is externalized and lacks depth. The pastor feels scared but tries to keep his faith.","Push internal conflict further. The pastor realizes his prayers no longer offer comfort, shaking his ability to lead, which impacts the group."
Plot Intrigue,"The pulse is a threat, but its origins are unclear and its motivations simple—just something to stop.",The pulse has ancient origins and has been waiting for centuries to be disturbed. It has a purpose beyond simple destruction—it consumes what it touches.
Vivid Descriptions,"The pulse shakes the ground and makes noise, described with limited sensory details.","Add more sensory components, such as 'The air shimmered with a pressure so intense it warped their vision.'"
Theme,"The pulse is portrayed as an external obstacle, something to fight against rather than a reflection of internal or psychological themes.","The pulse is not just a threat but a mirror reflecting characters' fears and flaws, amplifying their internal struggles."
Resolution,"The pulse is destroyed, and the town returns to normal with no lasting impact on the characters.","The pulse is silenced, but its echoes remain, leaving the town and characters forever changed by their experience."
