**Chapter 1: The Chase **

The forest **breathed**, and with it, so did the ground beneath her feet. Every step Sari took felt like she was sinking deeper into the earth, the pulse vibrating through the ground, through her veins. The fog clung to her skin, damp and suffocating, as if it was alive, pulling her into its grip.

**Talon was close.**

Sari’s breath came in short, sharp gasps, each one tearing through her chest. Her legs burned, but she couldn’t stop. Stopping meant death—or something worse. 

The Pulse whispered again, curling through the air like smoke, **"He’s gone. You’re alone."**

She stumbled, her foot catching on a root, and for a brief, cruel moment, her mind flashed back to another time—another life. **Talon, grinning like an idiot**, pushing her in an old, rusted wheelbarrow through a field of wildflowers. She had laughed so hard she nearly fell out, his teasing voice echoing in her ears: **“Hold on tight! If you fall, I’m not stopping!”**

But that memory was shattered the moment she hit the ground. The present snapped back in like a vice, suffocating her. This wasn’t that world anymore. That Talon wasn’t here.

Her feet pounded against the earth, pushing her forward. The pulse quickened beneath her, faster now, like it was trying to sync with her heartbeat. It wasn’t just beneath the ground anymore—it was in her, crawling through her veins, threatening to take her over.

The trees shifted in the fog, their branches curling like twisted fingers reaching for her. Sari ducked under one, her breath ragged as she tried to push the memory of Talon away. But it wouldn’t leave her. That smile, that stupid wheelbarrow, the way he’d tipped it just enough to scare her, but not enough to actually let her fall.

**“You’re such a jerk,”** she had laughed then, her legs hanging over the side, the sun warm on her face. **“I swear if you tip me, you’re dead.”**

**“I wouldn’t dream of it,”** Talon had said, a smirk playing on his lips. **“Besides, I kinda like you. I’ll keep you around.”**

Her heart twisted. That world—**their world**—was gone now. 

The fog thickened, and through the mist, she saw it—**a wolf**, its dark fur shimmering in the half-light. Its eyes glowed, but they weren’t just animal eyes. They were something more. Something aware.

Her pulse quickened again, matching the rhythm beneath her feet. Her body tensed, every instinct screaming at her to run, but the wolf just watched her, silent, waiting. 

The pulse throbbed inside her skull now, harder, faster. Her legs felt like they were moving through water, heavy and slow, and her mind fought against the growing terror. But the wolf’s gaze... it wasn’t attacking. It was just **watching**.

Suddenly, the wolf blinked, and the world shifted. The fog rolled in again, swallowing the wolf’s shape, and her legs moved before her mind could catch up. She crashed through the underbrush, branches tearing at her clothes, the forest twisting around her.

**You’re alone. You’ll never find him.**

“No,” she whispered, the word barely audible, lost in the wind. “I’m not alone.”

But even as she said it, a flicker of doubt crept in. **What if Talon was gone?** What if she was chasing a ghost? Her breath hitched at the thought, and another memory surfaced—Talon’s arms around her, the steady beat of his heart beneath her ear as they lay together on the grass. His warmth. His laugh.

**“You’re stuck with me,”** he had said once, his fingers tracing patterns on her arm. **“No matter what happens.”**

**No matter what happens.**

Sari’s heart clenched. **Where was he?**

The ground trembled beneath her feet, as if in response, and Sari stumbled again, her hands catching rough bark as she pressed herself against a tree. Her breath came in short, desperate bursts. She couldn’t think—couldn’t feel—beyond the pulse thundering through her. The world around her blurred, and for a moment, she swore she saw Talon’s face in the fog, his eyes wide, desperate, calling out to her.

**“Talon!”** Her voice cracked, the desperation spilling out like a wound.

The pulse stopped. Silence fell, thick and unnatural. The forest stilled, and for the first time in hours, Sari felt truly alone. She pressed a hand to her chest, trying to calm her racing heart, but it was useless. The quiet was worse than the noise. The quiet meant something terrible was coming.

And then the ground beneath her feet **shifted**.

At first, it was subtle, a soft vibration that barely registered. But it grew, stronger, faster, until the earth felt like it was heaving beneath her. The pulse was back, but this time it wasn’t just a sound or a feeling. It was alive. The ground pulsed with a life of its own, breathing, growing, reaching for her.

Sari’s stomach twisted as she pushed off the tree, her legs burning with each step as she tried to run. But the ground wouldn’t let her go. It grabbed at her feet, pulling her back. Her muscles screamed in protest, but she forced herself forward, the pulse pounding in her head, louder than ever.

**Stop running.**

The voice wasn’t just in her head. It was everywhere—around her, inside her, beneath her skin. She could feel it crawling through her veins, wrapping around her heart, squeezing until she thought it might burst.

But she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop. **Not until she found him**.


---

**Chapter 2: The Cabin**

The cold wasn’t just cold. It was something more—**a presence**, alive, coiling around her limbs, sinking its claws into her skin. Sari’s breath came out in jagged bursts, misting in the thick air of the cabin, but it didn’t feel like her breath anymore. The Pulse had changed everything. 

Even her.

The door creaked closed behind her, sealing her in with a soft **thud** that echoed in the oppressive silence. The weight of the air was unbearable, pressing down on her chest until she could barely breathe. She wasn’t safe here. She wasn’t safe anywhere. **But Talon was close.** She could feel it.

Her mind flashed to the last time she’d felt safe—truly safe—in his arms. They had been camping, deep in the woods, long before the Pulse twisted everything. She remembered the warmth of the fire crackling between them, the way Talon’s arm had draped around her shoulders, holding her close as they sat in the soft light of the flames. **That feeling of home, even in the middle of nowhere.**

Now, everything felt like nowhere.

“Talon?” The name slipped from her lips, barely more than a whisper. It felt fragile, like it might shatter in the silence of the cabin.

But there was no answer. 

There was only the ticking—**the clock in the corner**, its sound like the heartbeat of the house itself. The pulse beneath her skin synced with it, faster, harder, like it was trying to tear its way out of her. Her hand twitched toward her side, but she had nothing—no weapon, no way to fight. Just the raw, desperate need to survive.

Her eyes scanned the room, and for a moment, the world blurred, her mind pulling her back to another memory. Talon’s hand on her cheek, his thumb brushing against her skin, his voice soft as he whispered something only for her. They’d been lying together, tangled in sheets, his laugh warm and full as he told her **“I’ll always be here.”**

But now he wasn’t.

The sound of the ticking clock pulled her back to the present. Her heart pounded against her ribs, and she could feel the pulse inside her, crawling under her skin like a disease. **Was Talon even still in there?** The Pulse had taken him, twisted him into something **not him**, but she had to believe—she had to—that somewhere inside, the real Talon was still alive.

A low growl vibrated through the cabin, rattling the fragile windows. Her breath caught in her throat, panic seizing her. She turned toward the sound, but the room was empty. Her eyes darted to the corners where the shadows seemed heavier than before, darker, almost tangible.

“Talon?” Her voice cracked this time, her fear spilling into the word.

And then she saw him.

He stood in the doorway, half-hidden in the darkness, but she knew it was him. She’d always know him. The curve of his shoulders, the way his presence filled the space. But something was wrong. **Very wrong.**

His eyes caught the faint light from the window, and Sari’s breath hitched. **Those weren’t Talon’s eyes anymore.** They were hollow, dark, like the light had been sucked out of them. There was no recognition, no warmth. Just... emptiness.

She wanted to run to him, to wrap her arms around him and pull him back into the light. But her legs wouldn’t move. She was frozen, trapped between the past and the nightmare standing in front of her.

**This wasn’t him.**

“Talon?” It was barely a whisper now, a fragile thing hanging in the cold air.

He didn’t respond. Didn’t move. He just stood there, watching her, his lips curling into a smile that wasn’t his. It was a twisted thing, cruel and mocking, as though the Pulse had taken everything that had once been good about him and turned it inside out.

Her mind flashed again to another memory—Talon laughing, his arms around her as they danced in the rain. They’d been soaked through, her clothes clinging to her skin, but she hadn’t cared. She remembered the way he’d looked at her then, like she was the only thing in the world that mattered. **“We’re invincible,”** he had said, his grin wide, his hands pulling her closer.

Now, his smile was the thing that terrified her the most.

Her breath came faster, her heart slamming against her chest as the pulse roared in her ears. She had to do something—anything—to break this. To pull him back. But what could she do? What could she possibly do against something like the Pulse?

“Talon, please,” she choked, her voice breaking. “Please.”

For a moment—just a flicker—something human passed behind his eyes. Something **real**. 

Her heart surged with hope. She took a step forward, her hands trembling, reaching out for him. **“Talon, it’s me. I’m right here.”**

But it was gone, snuffed out like a candle. His eyes went dark again, hollow, and the twisted smile returned, sharper this time, like a blade.

He took a step forward, slow, deliberate. The cold followed him, sinking deeper into her bones. Her legs moved back on instinct, her body betraying her need to close the distance between them. The air around her thickened, suffocating.

“Talon...” Her voice was barely a breath. **He was gone.**

His footsteps echoed through the cabin as he came closer. She could see the way his hands twitched at his sides, like they wanted to reach out for her, but couldn’t. Or wouldn’t.

Sari’s heart raced, her mind scrambling for something—**anything**—that would bring him back. But the pulse beneath her skin was louder now, louder than her thoughts, louder than her fear. 

“You’re not real,” she whispered, her hands curling into fists at her sides. “You’re not him.”

But the Pulse had him. It had twisted him into something else, something monstrous, and no amount of memories could change that. The Talon she had loved was gone. Swallowed whole by the thing that hunted her now.

Her breath hitched as she took another step back, her hands trembling. **Talon, please.**

But he wasn’t there anymore. He was already lost.

And then, as if the world itself was breaking apart, the cabin seemed to shudder. The walls groaned, the ground trembled beneath her feet, and the shadows stretched longer, deeper, as if they were alive.

Sari turned toward the door, her pulse pounding in her ears. She had to get out. Now.

But Talon’s voice stopped her, low and cracked.

**“Sari.”**

It was the first time she had heard him say her name since this nightmare began. But it didn’t sound like him. It was cold, empty. Like the Pulse itself was speaking through him.

Her stomach twisted. She turned back, her eyes locking onto his, and for a moment, just a moment, she thought she saw him—the real Talon, somewhere deep inside. But then the shadows closed in again, and he was gone.

Completely gone.

**Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

Sari woke to darkness.

Not the kind of darkness you could close your eyes to and ignore. This was heavy, **alive**, pressing down on her chest like it was trying to smother her. She gasped, her hands clawing at the air, but there was nothing around her—nothing to hold onto, nothing to ground her. Just the cold, biting at her skin, and the pulse thrumming beneath her feet, beneath her bones, like a second heartbeat.

Her mind was foggy, memories tangled together like threads she couldn’t unravel. Where was she? The forest, the Pulse, **Talon...**

The image of his eyes, hollow and empty, flashed through her mind, sending a shiver down her spine. He had been there—in the cabin—but that wasn’t him. It wasn’t Talon. Not anymore.

She forced herself to stand, her legs shaking beneath her. The forest around her was different now—darker, twisted. The fog curled around the trees, wrapping itself around their branches like tendrils of smoke. The air was thick, suffocating, and her pulse pounded in her ears, faster, harder, as if it were syncing with the pulse beneath her skin.

**Talon.**

The thought of him cut through the fog in her mind, sharp and painful. She had to find him. She had to save him. He was still out there, somewhere in this nightmare, and if she could just reach him...

A memory surfaced, unbidden—a time before the Pulse, when the world had still made sense. She and Talon had been camping deep in the woods, far away from anyone or anything. She remembered the way the firelight had flickered across his face, the way his arm had wrapped around her, pulling her close. **“I’ll always be here,”** he had whispered, his breath warm against her ear. And she had believed him.

Now, everything felt cold. Empty. 

Sari stumbled forward, her legs unsteady, her breath coming in ragged bursts. The pulse was stronger now, crawling up her spine, twisting through her veins. She could feel it, like it was a part of her, like it was trying to take her over. 

The fog thickened, swirling around her in dense, ghostly tendrils. It moved between the trees, shifting, warping the world into something unrecognizable. Her eyes darted from shadow to shadow, but nothing seemed real anymore. The trees were too tall, their branches curling down like claws, and the ground beneath her feet felt soft, like it might give way at any moment.

Suddenly, something moved—a shape darting through the fog. Sari froze, her heart pounding in her chest. **Figures**, humanoid but twisted, moved between the trees, just on the edge of her vision. She couldn’t see them clearly, but she could feel them watching her. Their eyes—glowing, hollow, just like Talon’s—burned into her skin.

Her pulse quickened, and her breath caught in her throat. **This wasn’t real.** It couldn’t be. It was just the Pulse, playing tricks on her, warping her mind.

But the figures didn’t disappear. They circled her, silent, their bodies moving like shadows, fluid and quick. They didn’t come closer, but they didn’t leave either.

“Talon?” Her voice was a whisper, barely audible, but the figures stopped. For a moment, she thought they might be real. **What if one of them was him?**

Her mind betrayed her again, pulling her back to another memory—another time when she had called out his name. They had been hiking, the sun just beginning to set behind the trees. She had fallen behind, struggling to keep up, and he had stopped, waiting for her, his hand outstretched. **“Come on, slowpoke,”** he had teased, his eyes bright with laughter. **“I’m not leaving you behind.”**

But now he was the one who was gone.

The figures disappeared into the fog, swallowed whole by the darkness. Sari stumbled forward, her legs trembling beneath her. She had to keep moving. Had to find him. The pulse in her veins screamed louder now, drowning out everything else, and her breath came in shallow, ragged bursts.

The ground beneath her feet shifted, soft and uneven. The world tilted, and for a moment, Sari thought she might fall. Her hand shot out, catching a tree branch, and she clung to it, her chest heaving. **Focus. Just focus.**

But the ground was trembling now, shaking beneath her feet. The pulse wasn’t just in her anymore—it was in the earth, in the air, in the trees. It was everywhere.

She pushed herself off the tree and ran.

The ground split open behind her, deep fissures tearing through the earth. The trees shook, their branches swaying violently, as the forest seemed to collapse in on itself. The pulse screamed in her veins, louder and more violent with every step she took.

And then, she saw him.

**Talon.**

He was standing at the edge of the clearing, his back to her, his body half-hidden in the fog. Her heart seized in her chest, her breath catching in her throat. He was so close. So close she could almost touch him.

“Talon!” she screamed, her voice hoarse, desperate. She ran toward him, her legs burning with every step, the ground crumbling beneath her feet.

But he didn’t turn.

Another memory surfaced, this one more painful than the last. They had been in the middle of a storm, rain pouring down on them as they huddled together under the small canopy of their tent. Talon had pulled her close, his arm wrapped around her shoulders, his voice calm despite the chaos outside. **“We’ll be okay,”** he had whispered, his breath warm against her cheek. **“I’ve got you.”**

Now, he was the one she needed to save.

Sari pushed herself harder, her legs burning, her chest tight. She had to reach him. She had to—

The ground split open beneath her.

She fell, her body weightless as the world spun around her. The pulse screamed in her ears, louder than anything she had ever heard, drowning out her thoughts, her breath, her heartbeat. 

And then—a hand.

Talon’s hand, reaching down, pulling her up from the edge of the chasm. His fingers wrapped around her wrist, cold and unyielding, but she didn’t care. She clung to him, her breath coming in ragged gasps, tears stinging her eyes.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “You’re here.”

But something was wrong.

He pulled her to her feet, his eyes locking onto hers. But they weren’t his eyes anymore. They were hollow, empty, like the light had been sucked out of them. His face was the same, the sharp angles of his jaw, the curve of his lips, but there was no life behind it. 

Her stomach twisted, and she tried to pull back, but his grip tightened, his fingers digging into her skin. His smile—the one that used to make her heart skip a beat—was twisted now, cruel, like it had been warped by something inside him.

**This wasn’t him.**

“You’re not real,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “You’re not him.”

But the Pulse had him. She could feel it, twisting inside him, controlling him, turning him into something else. Something monstrous.

Her heart raced, and she tried to pull away again, but his grip was too strong. The pulse inside her screamed, louder now, as if it were trying to tear her apart from the inside. She struggled, her hands clawing at his, but the world around her was collapsing, the ground trembling beneath her feet.

“Talon, please,” she choked, her voice breaking. “Please, don’t.”

For a moment, his grip loosened, his eyes flickering with something human. **Something real.**

Her breath caught, and hope surged in her chest. **“Talon, I’m here. I’m right here.”**

But it was gone. The flicker disappeared, and his eyes turned cold again, darker than before. His hand tightened around her wrist, pulling her closer, his breath cold against her skin.

The pulse inside her roared, and she felt it—**the darkness spreading, twisting her insides**, pulling her deeper into the nightmare.

“Talon, no!” She screamed, but it was too late.

The ground collapsed beneath her, and she fell, the world spinning, the darkness swallowing her whole.

---

**Chapter 4: Shadows of Tomorrow**

Sari moved through the forest, her legs heavy, her breath ragged. The world around her was warped, twisted, the trees too tall, their branches curling downward like fingers reaching out for her. The fog clung to her skin, thick and suffocating, as though it were alive. The pulse beneath her feet vibrated, crawling up her spine, wrapping itself around her heart, squeezing tighter with every step she took.

Her body ached from the constant strain of running, of **fleeing** from a nightmare she couldn’t escape. But it wasn’t just her body that was breaking. It was everything. The world, her hope, her memories—everything was unraveling, pulling her deeper into the chaos.

**Talon.**

She had seen him. He had been there, so close she could have touched him. But that thing she saw wasn’t him, not anymore. His eyes, once full of warmth and laughter, had been empty, hollow. The Talon she knew was gone, twisted into something else by the Pulse. 

But she had to believe he was still in there. **Somewhere.**

Her heart clenched as her mind drifted back to the life they had imagined together. Before all of this, they had talked about their future, about escaping to a quiet place where they could build something together. **A cabin in the mountains**, tucked away from the chaos of the world. Somewhere peaceful, where they could raise a family, grow old together. She could still hear his voice, low and soft, as they had lay together under the stars.

**“Someday,”** he had whispered, his fingers tracing patterns on her arm. **“We’ll find our way out of this mess. Just the two of us, somewhere quiet. Somewhere safe.”**

She had believed him. She had held onto that dream, even as the world around them began to crumble. But now... 

Sari’s chest tightened, and she forced herself to keep moving. **The Pulse had taken everything from her.** Every step she took felt like it was pulling her further away from that future, from the life they had once hoped to build. But the dream still flickered in her mind, fragile and distant, like a candle struggling to stay lit in a storm.

The pulse throbbed louder in her veins, and Sari stumbled, her legs buckling beneath her. She collapsed against a tree, her hand pressing to her chest as if she could still hold the pieces of herself together. **Just keep going. Don’t stop.**

But the forest had other plans. The ground shifted beneath her feet, and the air grew colder, heavier. The trees swayed, their branches twisting and curling like the hands of some great, unseen force. 

Her vision blurred, and the shadows around her seemed to stretch and warp, taking on shapes that shouldn’t have been possible. For a moment, she swore she saw Talon’s face among them—his smile, that crooked grin that had always made her feel like everything was going to be okay.

But the shadows were playing tricks on her. It wasn’t real. **None of it was real.**

She pushed off the tree, her legs shaking beneath her, and kept moving. The ground trembled with every step, the pulse inside her screaming louder now, like it was trying to drown out everything else.

**“Talon, please,”** she whispered, her voice barely audible, lost in the wind. **“Come back.”**

But there was no answer. There hadn’t been for a long time.

The wind picked up, swirling through the trees, carrying with it the faintest echo of a memory. She could almost hear it—Talon’s voice, warm and familiar, calling her name. But when she turned, there was only fog, thick and impenetrable, swallowing the forest whole.

The memory hit her hard, sudden and unrelenting—a flash of **another dream**, one that they had shared on a quiet night, lying in each other’s arms. Talon had talked about a family, about children running through the grass, their laughter filling the air. **“I want that for us,”** he had said, his voice soft and full of hope. **“I want a family, Sari. I want to build something that lasts.”**

And she had smiled, her heart full, because she had wanted that too. She had imagined their children—**dark-haired, with Talon’s eyes**, the ones that sparkled with mischief and warmth. She had imagined teaching them how to read, watching them grow into people full of love and wonder. She had imagined holidays and birthdays, laughter and love, a future that felt so certain.

But now, those dreams were dead. Buried beneath the weight of the Pulse, suffocated by the darkness that had taken Talon from her. She would never have that future. She would never have him.

Her chest tightened, and she swallowed the lump in her throat. **Focus.** She couldn’t think about that now. She couldn’t let herself fall apart, not here. Not now.

The pulse inside her grew louder, drowning out her thoughts, her hopes, everything. It twisted inside her, pulling her deeper into its grip, making it harder to think, harder to breathe. The ground shifted beneath her feet again, and the world tilted dangerously.

A sharp crack split the air, and Sari’s heart leaped into her throat. She spun around, her eyes wide, searching the fog for the source of the sound. For a moment, she saw nothing—just the thick, swirling mist that seemed to stretch on forever.

But then she heard it—a low, guttural growl, rumbling through the air like thunder. The fog shifted, and out of the darkness stepped a figure—**a wolf**. Its fur was black, shimmering in the half-light, its eyes glowing like embers in the dark. 

Sari’s pulse quickened, and she took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest. The wolf’s gaze locked onto hers, its lips pulling back in a snarl. But it didn’t move. It just stood there, watching her, its breath steaming in the cold air.

**Talon.**

Her mind flashed to him, but she forced the thought away. **This wasn’t him.** The wolf wasn’t here to help her. It was here for something else.

The pulse inside her screamed, and Sari’s legs moved before her mind could catch up. She turned and ran, her feet pounding against the earth, the forest a blur of shadows and mist around her. The growl echoed through the trees, and she knew the wolf was following.

But the pulse was louder, stronger, twisting through her veins like fire. The ground trembled beneath her feet, the trees swaying violently as the forest seemed to shift and bend, warping under the weight of the Pulse. 

She could hear it now, not just inside her, but in the earth itself. The pulse was everywhere, alive, breathing, consuming everything in its path.

Sari stumbled, her foot catching on a root, and she fell hard to the ground, her hands scraping against the cold, wet earth. Her breath came in ragged gasps, her body trembling with exhaustion.

But as she lay there, gasping for breath, her mind betrayed her with another memory. **Talon, smiling at her**, his arms wrapped around her as they danced in the rain. They had been soaked through, their clothes clinging to their bodies, but they hadn’t cared. They had laughed, spinning in circles, their feet slipping on the wet grass. 

**“We’re invincible,”** he had said, grinning as he pulled her close. **“Nothing can touch us.”**

But now, everything was touching her. Everything was pulling her apart, piece by piece.

She pushed herself up, her arms shaking, and forced herself to stand. **Keep going. Don’t stop.** But the forest wasn’t letting her go. The ground trembled again, the trees groaning under the weight of the Pulse.

And then she saw it.

**Talon.**

He stood at the edge of the clearing, his back to her, his body half-hidden in the fog. Her breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, she forgot everything—the Pulse, the wolf, the forest falling apart around her. All she could see was him.

**“Talon!”** she screamed, her voice hoarse, desperate. She ran toward him, her legs burning with every step, the ground crumbling beneath her feet.

But he didn’t turn. He didn’t move. He just stood there, as still as a statue, as cold as the fog that surrounded him.

Sari’s heart slammed against her chest, her pulse roaring in her ears. **This isn’t real. It can’t be real.** But she kept running, her feet slipping on the wet ground, her breath coming in ragged bursts.

She reached out for him, her fingers trembling, but the moment her hand touched his shoulder, the world shifted.

Talon turned, his eyes locking onto hers, and Sari’s heart shattered.

**This wasn’t him.**

---

**Chapter 5: Into the Shadows**

The forest was closing in.

Sari could feel it—the weight of the air pressing down on her, the pulse vibrating through the ground, crawling up her legs, into her chest. Every step felt heavier, like the earth itself was trying to swallow her whole. Her breath came in short, ragged bursts, the fog thick around her, making it impossible to see more than a few feet ahead. 

But it wasn’t just the fog or the forest that was suffocating her. It was the **silence**. The absence of Talon. The void where he used to be.

She stumbled forward, her body aching, her heart pounding in her ears. The memory of his face—the way his eyes had gone dark, empty—played over and over in her mind. The pulse inside her screamed, but she ignored it. She had to. She had to keep moving.

Her foot caught on a root, and she fell hard, her hands scraping against the cold, wet ground. For a moment, she just lay there, her body trembling, exhaustion pulling at her. She wanted to close her eyes, to let go, to give in to the pulse that throbbed inside her. **But she couldn’t.**

**You’re stronger than this.** The thought came unbidden, a whisper in the back of her mind, and with it came a memory—one that had nothing to do with Talon. 

It was her father, standing over her as she struggled to lift the heavy piece of wood from the ground. She had been a child then, small and stubborn, determined to prove she could handle the chore he had given her.

“Don’t quit now,” he had said, his voice low but firm, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “You’ve got more in you than you know.”

She had gritted her teeth, her muscles burning, but she hadn’t stopped. She had lifted the wood, her arms shaking with the effort, and when she had finally dropped it onto the pile, her father had nodded, his smile widening.

“See?” he had said, wiping the sweat from her brow. “Tough as nails, kid. Just like your mom.”

The memory flickered, warm and steady, and Sari felt a surge of strength push through her. She wasn’t weak. She wasn’t broken. **She had survived worse than this.**

Pushing herself to her feet, Sari wiped the dirt from her palms, her breath still shaky but more controlled now. The pulse throbbed in her veins, but it wasn’t in control. **She was.**

She moved forward, her steps more deliberate now, her eyes scanning the fog for any sign of danger. The forest was still, but she knew better than to trust it. **The Pulse was everywhere**, watching, waiting for her to falter. 

But she wouldn’t.

Not now. Not ever.

---

The fog thickened as she moved deeper into the forest, the trees closing in, their branches reaching down like claws. The pulse in the ground was louder here, more erratic, vibrating through her bones with every step. She could feel it pulling at her, dragging her down, but she kept moving, her eyes focused ahead.

Her mind drifted to Talon, the memory of his face still fresh, still painful. She had seen him—felt him—but he wasn’t the same. The Pulse had twisted him into something she barely recognized. But she couldn’t let go. Not yet. Not until she knew for sure.

**“We’ll get through this,”** he had told her once, long before the Pulse had taken hold. They had been sitting on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the valley below, the sun setting behind them. His hand had been warm in hers, his voice steady. **“No matter what happens, we’ll make it out together.”**

Now, that promise felt distant. Fragile. A dream that would never come true.

But it was still there, flickering in the back of her mind like a dying flame. She held onto it, even though she knew it was foolish. Even though she knew that the Talon she had loved might be gone forever.

The pulse screamed louder now, echoing through the forest, and Sari’s breath hitched. The ground shifted beneath her feet, and for a moment, she thought she might fall again. But she didn’t.

**You’ve got more in you than you know.**

Her father’s words echoed in her mind, steady and strong, grounding her. She wasn’t just fighting for Talon. She was fighting for herself. For the life she had built before him, the strength she had carried with her long before he had come into her world.

She wasn’t weak. She wasn’t helpless.

The fog swirled around her, and for a brief moment, she thought she saw something moving between the trees—a shadow, dark and twisted, its shape barely discernible through the mist. Her pulse quickened, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t afford to stop.

---

The air grew colder, sharper, as Sari pressed on, her mind buzzing with memories and thoughts she couldn’t quiet. Every step felt heavier, like the forest was pulling her deeper into its grasp. But she had to keep going. **She had to find him.**

As she walked, another memory surfaced—this time, it was of Talon. They had been lying in bed, their bodies tangled together, the world outside forgotten. **“You’re my home,”** he had whispered, his breath warm against her neck. **“Wherever you are, that’s where I want to be.”**

But now, home felt like a distant dream. The future they had once imagined—full of laughter, love, and quiet moments together—was slipping away, dissolving into the fog that surrounded her.

Sari’s throat tightened, and she swallowed hard, forcing the emotion back down. **Focus.** She had to stay focused. The future was gone, but she was still here. And as long as she was still here, she could keep fighting.

Her breath came in short, sharp bursts as the pulse grew louder, more chaotic, echoing through the trees like a drumbeat. The fog was thicker now, almost impenetrable, and Sari’s heart raced as she strained to see through it.

Then, she heard it—a low growl, deep and guttural, rumbling through the air like thunder. Her heart skipped a beat, and she froze, her eyes scanning the shadows for the source of the sound.

**The wolf.**

It was back, its dark shape materializing out of the mist, its eyes glowing like embers in the darkness. Sari’s pulse quickened, her hands trembling as the wolf took a step closer, its gaze locked onto hers.

But she didn’t run.

She stood her ground, her heart pounding in her chest, her mind racing. **This wasn’t the first time she had faced danger.**

The wolf growled again, its lips pulling back in a snarl, but Sari held her ground. **She wasn’t helpless.** She wasn’t weak.

“I’m not afraid of you,” she whispered, her voice steady, her breath slow.

And for the first time, the pulse inside her quieted.
