**Chapter 2: The Cabin**

The cabin stood before her, broken and decayed. It had once been a place of refuge, a sanctuary built on dreams. But now, as Sari looked at its warped beams and shattered windows, she could feel the weight of what it had become—a graveyard of hopes long lost. The roof sagged, the walls leaned inward, and the air itself seemed heavier here, **as if the Pulse had invaded the very essence of this place**, twisting it from within.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat as she stepped forward. **The Pulse was everywhere**, not just in the air but in the ground beneath her feet, in the dark corners of the room, in the shadows that seemed to flicker with every step she took. Its presence was suffocating, pressing down on her chest, as if the very act of breathing was a battle.

**But Talon was here. He had to be.**

Her fingers trembled as they grazed the doorframe, worn and splintered. She stepped inside, her heart pounding. The silence was deafening. The cabin was once filled with their laughter, their plans for the future—but now, it was filled with **something else**, something dark and insidious.

The memories of their time here flickered in her mind—**Talon’s smile as they sketched the plans for their dream home**, the warmth of his hand wrapped around hers as they imagined their future. But now, those memories felt like a cruel joke, twisted and corrupted, much like the place itself.

She moved further into the room, her eyes scanning the decay, and then—**she saw him**.

Talon stood near the window, his back to her, his shoulders hunched as if weighed down by some invisible burden. For a moment, hope surged in her chest, but something was wrong. His silhouette seemed to waver, as if the air around him was rippling, distorting his form.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling.

He didn’t move.

Her heart pounded harder as she took another step closer. **It had to be him. It had to be.** But the flickering grew worse, and a chill crawled up her spine.

“Talon!” she called again, louder this time, the desperation leaking into her voice.

Slowly, he turned to face her, but when his eyes met hers, **the hope in her chest shattered**.

His face was hollow, his eyes blackened, devoid of any light or warmth. **The man she had loved was gone**. The Pulse had taken him, twisted him into something unrecognizable. His skin, once warm and vibrant, was now pale, **veins of darkness snaking beneath the surface**, like roots of a twisted tree spreading through his body.

“No,” she whispered, barely a breath. Her legs wobbled beneath her as she moved closer, her hand reaching out to him. **It couldn’t be true.** Talon couldn’t be gone.

But as her fingers brushed against his cold skin, he recoiled, his body jerking back, the darkness pulsing beneath his flesh.

“Talon, please,” she begged, tears stinging her eyes. “I’m here. **You can fight this.** You’re stronger than it. You have to be.”

His lips parted, but no words came out. His body trembled, convulsing as though something inside him was **trying to break free**. For a moment—just a fleeting second—his eyes cleared, and she saw him. **Talon**. His real self, hidden beneath the darkness. He was still there, fighting.

Her heart leapt. **There was still hope**.

But just as quickly as it had come, the moment passed. The Pulse surged again, and his body convulsed violently. **The black veins crawled further up his neck**, twisting his features into a grotesque mask of pain. His limbs jerked, and a low growl escaped his throat, something primal, something wrong.

“Talon!” she cried, her voice breaking, but it was no use. The Pulse was winning.

Her mind raced. **She had to do something**, but what? She couldn’t let the Pulse take him, not like this. But as she looked at him—his body twitching, his face contorted—**doubt crept in**. What if he was already gone? What if saving him wasn’t possible?

Her hands shook, and the weight of it all pressed down on her. **Was she really trying to save him for his sake, or for her own?** What if holding on was only making things worse—prolonging his suffering?

Her eyes filled with tears as she clutched his arm, her fingers digging into his skin. **She wasn’t ready to give up. Not yet.**

“Talon, please,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I can’t do this without you. **You have to fight.**”

His chest heaved, his breath coming in ragged bursts, but his body was losing the battle. **The Pulse was consuming him**—piece by piece.

---

**Suddenly, his body twitched violently**, his back arching off the floor as the Pulse tightened its grip. Sari recoiled, her heart pounding in her chest. **It was happening again.** The Pulse was pulling him deeper into its control.

But then, for the briefest of moments, his eyes flickered. **They cleared**. His lips parted, and he whispered her name.

“Sari...”

Her breath caught in her throat. **He was still in there**.

“I’m here, Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she knelt beside him, her hands cradling his face. “I’m not leaving you. **I’m not letting you go.**”

But as she watched, his body twisted again, the Pulse surging, the black veins crawling further across his skin. His eyes rolled back, and his body convulsed, limbs jerking in unnatural angles.

The Pulse was **transforming him** into something else, something monstrous.

Her heart pounded as she held onto him, refusing to let go. **She had come all this way**—she couldn’t give up now. But **was it even him anymore?**

Her mind was screaming at her to leave, to run, to save herself before it was too late, but she couldn’t. She couldn’t leave him. **Not like this.**

---

Suddenly, the cabin groaned, the walls shuddering violently as cracks splintered across the wooden beams. **The Pulse wasn’t just in Talon**—it was in the cabin, in the very walls, **tearing everything apart**. The ground beneath her feet trembled, and the air thickened, pressing down on her like a suffocating weight.

The Pulse was growing stronger, its presence pushing into her mind, whispering in her ear, feeding on her fear.

*He’s gone. You can’t save him. You’ll die here too.*

Her body trembled, her breath coming in short, panicked bursts. **What if the Pulse was right?** What if she couldn’t save him?

But she wasn’t ready to give up. Not yet.

With a cry of desperation, she grabbed Talon’s arm, pulling him into her embrace, her body shaking with the effort. **She wasn’t going to let him go**. Not now. Not ever.

The Pulse howled in protest, the air thick with its presence, but she held onto him, her heart racing, her mind reeling. **She wasn’t leaving him behind.**

As she struggled to pull him toward the door, Talon’s body jerked again, his eyes fluttering open one last time. For a moment, he was there. **Really there.**

“Sari...” His voice was faint, barely more than a breath, but it was him. **It was him.**

Her tears fell freely now, her heart breaking. “I’m here, Talon,” she whispered. **“I’m right here.”**

But then the Pulse surged again, and Talon’s body convulsed violently, his eyes rolling back as the darkness took him once more. The black veins pulsed, twisting his limbs, and the cabin groaned, the walls cracking under the pressure.

Sari’s heart pounded. **She had to make a choice.**

Her grip tightened on his arm, her mind racing. **She couldn’t stay here**—the Pulse was too strong. But she couldn’t leave him either. Not like this. Not now.

With one last burst of strength, she pulled him up, her muscles screaming in protest, her lungs burning with every breath. **She wasn’t letting go.** She wouldn’t lose him.

Not again.

### **Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

The cabin groaned, the walls trembling as if they, too, were being consumed by the Pulse. **Talon lay motionless in her arms**, his body cold and heavy, the black veins still pulsing faintly beneath his skin. Sari’s heart pounded, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she clutched him tighter, her tears falling onto his lifeless face.

He was gone. **Truly gone this time.**

Her fingers trembled as they brushed against his cheek, her mind reeling from the weight of it all. She had fought so hard to save him, to bring him back from the Pulse’s grasp, but now—now, there was nothing left to fight for. **She had lost him.**

The silence in the cabin was suffocating, broken only by the low, ominous creaks of the rotting wood. The Pulse had taken everything from them. The life they had dreamed of building together—the cabin, the future, all of it—was crumbling around her.

Sari’s chest tightened. **What was left for her now?**

The walls groaned again, cracks splintering through the beams as the Pulse pressed in on them from every direction. The very air felt heavy, thick with the suffocating presence of the Pulse, as though it was trying to **squeeze the life out of her**, too. But she couldn’t move. She couldn’t leave him. **Not like this.**

*Maybe it was time to let go.* The thought wormed its way into her mind, cold and cruel. Would it be easier to just let the Pulse take her? To stop fighting, stop struggling, and simply let go?

Her hands shook as she held Talon tighter, her vision blurred by tears. **She didn’t know if she had the strength to keep fighting.**

But then—**Talon’s body twitched**.

Sari froze, her breath catching in her throat. **No. It couldn’t be.**

For a second, she thought she had imagined it. But then his chest rose—just barely—and his fingers moved, a faint, fragile movement. **He was still alive.**

Her heart leapt in her chest, hope surging through her like a flame. **He wasn’t gone. Not yet.**

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling. Her hand cupped his face, her fingers brushing through his hair. His skin was cold, but there was still warmth—**a flicker of life**—beneath her touch.

“Please,” she whispered again, her voice shaking with desperation. “Talon, come back to me. I’m here. **I’m right here.**”

His eyes fluttered, and for a brief moment, they opened. **They were clear.** The darkness had receded, and for the first time since they had entered the cabin, Sari saw **him**—the man she had loved, the man she had fought so hard to save. His gaze locked on hers, confused and weak, but **real**.

“Sari...” he whispered, his voice barely more than a breath. 

Her breath hitched, tears streaming down her face. **He was still there**.

“I’m here, Talon,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I’m right here. Don’t leave me. **Please, don’t leave me.**”

But as quickly as the moment had come, **it shattered**. Talon’s body jerked violently, the black veins pulsing beneath his skin as the Pulse surged again. His eyes rolled back, and his limbs convulsed, twisting at unnatural angles. A guttural scream tore from his throat, primal and raw.

“No!” Sari cried, her voice breaking as she held onto him. “**Talon!** Fight it! You have to fight it!”

But his body continued to convulse, the Pulse tightening its grip on him, pulling him deeper into its control. The black veins crawled up his neck, twisting across his face, as though they were **feeding on him**, consuming him from the inside out.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing. **She had to do something**. She couldn’t let the Pulse take him—not again. But the doubt gnawed at her, its icy fingers digging into her thoughts. **Was it even possible to save him?** Or was she just prolonging his suffering?

Her breath came in short, panicked bursts as she clutched his hand, her fingers trembling. **What was she fighting for?** Was it really for him—or was it for herself? Could she live with herself if she let him go? Or would it be more merciful to set him free?

The cabin groaned again, louder this time, the walls shuddering violently as the Pulse’s influence spread further, cracking the foundation beneath her. **Time was running out**.

“Sari...” Talon’s voice was faint, barely audible over the sound of the Pulse ripping through him. His eyes flickered open again, just for a moment, but they were **clouded**, darkened by the Pulse’s hold. 

Her heart twisted painfully in her chest. She could see the man she loved in there, trapped beneath the darkness, **fighting to stay alive**. But the Pulse was too strong. It wouldn’t let go—not unless she made it.

**But what could she do?**

---

The Pulse’s presence pressed down on her like a weight, suffocating, relentless. Its whispers slithered through her mind, **cold and mocking**.

*You can’t save him,* the Pulse hissed, its voice sharp and cutting. *He’s already gone. You’ve already lost him.*

Sari gasped, her body trembling as the Pulse’s tendrils seemed to **wrap around her limbs**, pulling her down, pulling her into the darkness. Her vision blurred, her strength fading, but she held onto Talon’s hand, refusing to let go.

“I won’t lose you,” she whispered, her voice fierce despite the fear clawing at her chest. **“Not again.”**

But the Pulse wasn’t finished. It lashed out, its dark tendrils wrapping tighter around Talon’s body, pulling him deeper, faster. His chest heaved, his limbs jerking violently as the black veins spread further, enveloping him.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. **She couldn’t let this happen.** She couldn’t let the Pulse take him—not after everything they had fought for, everything they had built.

But as she looked at him—his face contorted in pain, his body barely holding on—**the doubt crept in again**. Was she doing the right thing? Was there even anything left of Talon to save?

Her hands shook as she clutched him tighter, her mind reeling. **What was she supposed to do?** If she stayed, the Pulse would take them both. But if she left... if she left, what would be left of him?

The Pulse tightened its grip, the darkness curling around her arms and legs, pulling her down, **freezing her from the inside out**. Her breath came in shallow bursts, her chest burning, but still, she held on. **She couldn’t let him go.**

“I won’t leave you,” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. **But was that true?**

Her mind screamed at her to run, to save herself, but she couldn’t. She couldn’t leave him behind—not after everything they had been through. **She wasn’t ready to give up.**

With a cry of desperation, Sari pulled Talon closer, her body shaking with the effort, her muscles screaming in protest. **She wasn’t leaving him behind.**

---

The cabin groaned again, the walls shuddering violently, and this time, the floor beneath them began to splinter. **The Pulse was consuming everything**, and soon, there would be nothing left.

Talon’s body jerked again, his back arching off the ground as the Pulse surged one final time. His eyes snapped open, and for a moment, they were clear again—**just for a moment**. 

“Sari...” he whispered, his voice raw, broken. **But it was him.**

Her heart shattered at the sound of his voice. She wanted to hold onto that moment, to believe that he could come back, but the Pulse wasn’t finished. His body convulsed again, harder this time, and the darkness swallowed him whole.

The black veins pulsed, tightening their grip, and Sari’s vision blurred. **She had to make a choice**. She couldn’t stay here—not with the Pulse closing in. But she couldn’t leave him, either. **Could she?**

Her hands shook as she cradled his face, her tears falling freely now. “I won’t lose you,” she whispered, her voice breaking. **“I won’t let you go. Not again.”**

But even as she said the words, she knew—**he was already gone**.

The cabin shuddered violently, the walls cracking, the floor splitting beneath her feet. The Pulse was everywhere, suffocating the air, twisting the space around them. 

Sari’s breath came in ragged bursts, her body trembling. She couldn’t stay here—not anymore. But she wasn’t leaving him behind. Not now. Not ever.

With one

 last burst of strength, she pulled him into her arms, his body limp and cold. Her muscles screamed in protest, her lungs burning with every breath, but she didn’t stop. **She couldn’t stop**.

The Pulse howled, its dark tendrils reaching out, but Sari pushed forward, her heart racing, her mind screaming. **She wasn’t going to let it take him.**

Not now. **Not ever.**
