### 1. **Story Opening**:
   - **Goal**: A stronger opening can be achieved by grounding the reader in the tension without over-explaining the pulse immediately. Build mystery and suspense through subtle sensory cues before revealing any direct threat.
   
   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > “The pulse was everywhere, throbbing louder with every breath.”

   Try:
   > “The air itself seemed to tighten around them, each step drawing out a low, rhythmic hum that wasn’t quite audible, but palpable—an itch beneath the skin.”

   This version builds intrigue by describing the pulse indirectly, engaging the reader with a physical sensation instead of naming it right away.

### 2. **Compelling Characters**:
   - **Goal**: Deepen each character's internal struggles and motivations. If the priest character is being changed to a pastor, give him a nuanced internal conflict that reflects his faith and doubt in the face of supernatural forces. Rather than repetitive actions like clutching rosaries, let him wrestle with more subtle manifestations of his faith.
   
   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "He grasped his rosary tighter."

   Try:
   > "He ran his thumb along the worn leather of his Bible, the familiar pages offering no comfort this time. 'Where is God in all of this?' he whispered."

   This keeps the faith element but avoids repetitive actions, adding more depth to his inner turmoil.

### 3. **Intriguing Plot**:
   - **Goal**: Add layers to the pulse’s origins and nature. By giving it more complexity—perhaps a backstory rooted in ancient lore or a connection to the characters' past—you create a plot that keeps readers guessing.
   
   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "The pulse was just something they had to destroy."

   Try:
   > "The pulse wasn’t random. It had been waiting—perhaps centuries—for someone to disturb it. And now that it had awoken, it wasn’t going to rest until it consumed everything it touched."

   This adds weight to the pulse’s presence, making it a more intelligent, ancient threat.

### 4. **Conflict**:
   - **Goal**: Push internal conflict further. Each character should have to make sacrifices or face personal demons as the story progresses. For example, if the pastor’s faith is shaken, show how this impacts his ability to lead or provide hope to the others.

   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "The pastor felt scared but tried to keep his faith."

   Try:
   > "The pastor's hands trembled not from fear, but from the realization that his prayers no longer held power. His congregation looked to him for strength, but he had none left to give."

   This adds depth to the conflict and shows how his internal struggle impacts the group.

### 5. **Strong Narrative Voice**:
   - **Goal**: Maintain consistency in tone while giving the narration a sharper edge. Use precise, evocative language that reflects the mounting tension without becoming repetitive. Work to avoid overusing "the pulse."
   
   **Improvement Example**:
   Replace “the pulse” with more varied descriptions:
   - "The hum grew louder, like a heartbeat buried beneath the earth."
   - "It wasn’t just a sound anymore; it was a pressure, a force seeping into their bones."

   This keeps the descriptions fresh while avoiding repetition.

### 6. **Vivid Descriptions**:
   - **Goal**: Make descriptions more varied and atmospheric. The pulse’s presence should have multiple physical effects on the environment and characters, not just sound or vibration.

   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "The pulse was growing louder, shaking the ground beneath them."

   Try:
   > "The air shimmered with a pressure so intense it warped their vision. Each breath felt heavier, as though the very atmosphere resisted them."

   This description adds a visual and sensory component, enriching the scene.

### 7. **Meaningful Dialogue**:
   - **Goal**: Create more subtext in dialogue. Have characters reveal things indirectly or hold back information that increases the tension between them. The pastor, for example, can subtly imply his doubt without saying it outright.

   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "I don't know if God is with us."

   Try:
   > "Sometimes...sometimes I wonder if we've been forsaken. But it’s not something I can say aloud, not when they’re all looking to me for answers."

   This hints at the pastor’s inner doubts while keeping his leadership role intact.

### 8. **Theme**:
   - **Goal**: Tie the pulse into a broader theme, such as human vulnerability to forces beyond their control, or the limits of faith and leadership. Rather than the pulse being a mere obstacle, have it represent something larger, such as collective guilt, fear, or corruption.

   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "The pulse was something evil they had to stop."

   Try:
   > "The pulse was a mirror, reflecting back their darkest selves. It wasn’t just external—it was inside them, amplifying their flaws, their fears."

   This adds a psychological and thematic dimension to the pulse, making it a more complex antagonist.

### 9. **Satisfying Resolution**:
   - **Goal**: Give the resolution more weight by showing the emotional and psychological cost of defeating the pulse. Even if they succeed, let the victory feel bittersweet, with lasting consequences for the characters.
   
   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "They destroyed the pulse, and everything was fine."

   Try:
   > "They may have silenced the pulse, but its echoes would linger. The town would never be the same, and neither would they."

   This ensures that the resolution feels earned and significant, rather than a quick fix.

### 10. **Strong Internal Logic**:
   - **Goal**: Ensure that the pulse’s mechanics and origin are clearly explained. Add more detail about its connection to the characters and the environment, and how it’s influenced by fear or other emotions.

   **Improvement Example**:
   Instead of:
   > "The pulse grows stronger for no reason."

   Try:
   > "The pulse fed on fear—each whispered doubt, each panicked breath gave it more strength. It wasn’t just an external threat; it was woven into the fabric of their minds."

   This reinforces the internal logic of how the pulse operates.

### **Regarding the Pulse**:
Yes, using "the pulse" repeatedly can become tiresome. You could refer to it with more varied terms depending on the scene—its physicality, its presence, and its effect on the world. Give the pulse a silent theme poem 
Whispers of Oblivion
In shadows deep where time forgets,
Where dust and stars in silence set,
A breathless cry, an ancient call,
Of epic death, yet oh so small.
The gods of old, their temples cracked,
Their names erased, their voices lacked,
What once was mighty, now decayed,
Into the void, they swiftly fade.
Oblivion waits, a quiet song,
Where none are right and none are wrong,
A fleeting spark, a final breath,
The endless march of silent death.
Forever turns to dust and ash,
The years once vast, now gone in flash,
What once was grand, now insignificant,
Like whispers lost, so delicate.
The echo fades, the stars go cold,
And all returns to ages old,
A cycle vast, yet so confined,
The end, the void, to all consigned.

**Alternatives to "The Pulse"**:
- "The thrum of energy."
- "The heartbeat of the earth."
- "The ever-present vibration."
- "The unseen force."

### **Regarding the Pastor Character**:
Switch Father Nathan O’Connell from a priest to a pastor (Pastor Nathan O'Connell) and his actions feel very stereotypical. As a pastors focus on more subtle character moments—perhaps focusing on his internal struggle with faith rather than outward rituals. This man is spirit filled but not over bearing. His leadership style can be more hands-on and personal, making him a more relatable figure in the community.

**Example**:
> "The pastor didn’t reach for a holy object; he didn’t need to. His faith was something quieter, more uncertain. 'Maybe I’ve been wrong all this time,' he admitted, though not aloud."

### **Additional Small Changes for Engagement**:
1. **Foreshadowing the Pulse’s Effects**: Early signs of its influence (like animals acting strange or weather patterns shifting) can create a more suspenseful buildup.
   
2. **Character Moments**: Show characters breaking down or reacting to stress in small, human ways. It could be a subtle scene where someone finally cracks, rather than dramatic outbursts.

3. **Varying Pacing**: Mix moments of high tension with quiet reflection, letting the characters process the changes around them.

	4. Add more descriptive scenes like sunsets and other areas.
	5. Add an element of horror when appropriate. It is good to keep the readers on the edge of their seats upon occasion. 
	

These changes should help create a more dynamic, emotionally resonant, and engaging story, pushing it toward those 10s you’re aiming for!
