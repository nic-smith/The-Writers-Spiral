**Chapter 11: The Pulse's Grip**

---

The forest blurred around her as Sari ran, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her legs burned, her chest ached, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop.

Behind her, she could still hear the voice—her own voice—echoing through the trees, chasing her.

“The pulse is inside you…”

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest, the pulse reverberating through her body. She could feel it now, deep inside her, a constant, unrelenting presence. It was in her veins, in her bones, in her mind.

But she couldn’t give in. She wouldn’t.

Sari stumbled over a root, nearly falling, but she caught herself just in time. The shadows were closing in, the twisted figures from the fire moving silently between the trees. She could feel their hollow eyes watching her, waiting for her to fall, to give up.

But she wouldn’t. She had to keep going.

The forest began to thin, the trees growing more sparse as she pushed forward. Sari’s heart leaped in her chest—maybe there was an end to this. Maybe there was a way out.

She could see it now, up ahead—an opening in the trees. A clearing. It was small, but it was there, a break in the suffocating darkness.

Sari’s legs trembled beneath her as she forced herself to move faster, to reach the clearing before the pulse consumed her entirely.

But as she broke through the trees and into the clearing, she stopped dead in her tracks.

It wasn’t an escape.

It was the center.

The pulse was here.

The clearing was massive, far larger than she had first thought. The ground was cracked and blackened, scorched by the heat of the pulse. In the center of the clearing stood a massive stone monolith, ancient and weathered, its surface covered in strange, unreadable symbols.

And in front of the monolith, standing motionless, was Talon.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. “Talon…”

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just stood there, his back to her, his head bowed as though in silent prayer.

Sari took a hesitant step forward, her heart pounding in her chest. “Talon… please. Say something.”

But he didn’t respond.

She took another step, her hands trembling at her sides. “Talon… it’s me. It’s Sari. Please, we can get out of here. We can—”

Before she could finish, Talon slowly turned to face her.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. His eyes—those empty, hollow eyes—stared back at her, devoid of any emotion, any life.

“Talon…” she whispered, her voice shaking. “Please… don’t do this.”

But Talon didn’t move. He just stood there, watching her, his expression cold, unfeeling.

Sari’s heart twisted in her chest. He was gone. The pulse had taken him. She had lost him.

But she couldn’t lose herself.

With a surge of desperation, Sari turned and ran, her legs trembling beneath her. The pulse roared in her ears, louder than ever, shaking the ground beneath her feet.

But she didn’t look back.

 **Chapter 12: The Confrontation**

---

Sari’s breath came in ragged gasps as she fled the clearing, her heart pounding in her chest. The pulse was relentless, pounding through her veins, clouding her thoughts, but she forced herself to keep moving.

She couldn’t stay here. She couldn’t let it take her.

The trees closed in around her as she ran, the shadows flickering and twisting like smoke. The ground beneath her feet was shifting again, rolling and undulating like waves, but she kept moving, her body trembling from exhaustion and fear.

Behind her, she could hear Talon’s footsteps. Slow. Deliberate.

He was following her.

Sari’s stomach twisted in knots. Talon was gone—the man she knew was gone—but his body, his *form*, was still coming after her. The pulse had taken him, had consumed him, and now it was coming for her too.

She couldn’t let it win.

Sari stumbled over a root, her foot catching on the uneven ground. She fell hard, her hands scraping against the rough earth. Pain shot through her palms, but she barely registered it over the roar of the pulse in her ears.

She lay there for a moment, gasping for breath, her body trembling. She could feel the pulse tightening around her, pulling her deeper into the ground, into the darkness. The shadows were closing in, wrapping around her like a vice.

But she couldn’t give in.

With a surge of strength, Sari pushed herself to her feet, her legs shaking beneath her. She turned to face the direction she had come from, her heart pounding in her chest.

Talon stood at the edge of the clearing, his hollow eyes fixed on her. He didn’t speak. He didn’t move. He just stood there, watching her.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. “Talon…” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Please… let me go.”

But he didn’t respond. He just stared at her, his expression cold, emotionless.

The pulse was roaring in her ears, louder than ever, shaking the ground beneath her feet. The shadows were closing in, their hollow eyes watching her, waiting for her to fall, to give up.

But she wouldn’t. She couldn’t.

Sari clenched her fists, her heart pounding in her chest. “Talon… please.

 I know you’re still in there. I know you’re still *you*.”

But he didn’t move. He didn’t speak.

Sari’s stomach twisted. She could feel the pulse tightening around her, pulling her closer to the ground. She was losing. She was losing herself.

And then, in a voice so faint she almost didn’t hear it, Talon spoke.

“You can’t run from it.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. “Talon…”

He took a step forward, his movements slow, deliberate. “You’re part of it now. Just like me.”

Sari’s heart raced. She took a step back, her hands trembling. “No. No, I’m not. I’m not like you.”

Talon’s hollow eyes glinted in the dim light. “The pulse is inside you. You can’t escape.”

Sari shook her head, her pulse quickening. “No… I won’t let it take me. I won’t.”

But Talon didn’t stop. He kept moving forward, his eyes locked on hers. “There’s no escaping it, Sari. It’s part of you now. It’s part of everything.”

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. She could feel the pulse pulling at her, dragging her down. The shadows were closing in, the ground was shifting beneath her feet.

She was losing.

But she couldn’t let it win. She couldn’t.

With a burst of desperation, Sari turned and ran again, her legs trembling beneath her. The pulse was roaring in her ears, shaking the ground beneath her feet, but she didn’t stop.

She wouldn’t stop.

Not until she was free.

---

Let’s move forward with **Chapters 13, 14, and 15**, continuing the escalation of tension and supernatural horror. These chapters will push the story toward its climax, with Sari making difficult choices about her fate and the pulse. Talon’s transformation will be fully realized, and we’ll see more of the pulse’s influence, leading Sari into a final, inevitable confrontation.

---

 **Chapter 13: The Edge of Oblivion**

---

Sari ran until her legs could no longer carry her.

She stumbled to a stop at the edge of a cliff, her breath ragged, the pulse still roaring in her ears. Her body was trembling, her heart pounding so hard she thought it might burst. The trees around her swayed and bent, the shadows flickering unnaturally, but here, at the edge of the cliff, the ground felt… still.

It wasn’t quiet—the pulse was never quiet—but it felt different here. Like it was waiting.

Sari looked out over the cliff. Below her, the forest stretched endlessly, a sea of blackened trees and twisting shadows. The sky above was thick with clouds, swirling ominously, as if the entire world was caught in some kind of unnatural storm.

The pulse throbbed beneath her feet, vibrating through the ground, but Sari forced herself to take a deep breath, to calm her racing heart.

She didn’t know how much longer she could keep running.

Behind her, she could still hear Talon’s footsteps—slow, deliberate. He wasn’t far, but he wasn’t running either. He didn’t need to. The pulse was doing all the work for him, dragging her deeper into its grip with every passing second.

Sari clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. She couldn’t keep doing this. She couldn’t keep running from something that was inside her.

She had to stop. She had to face him.

The pulse pulsed harder beneath her feet, as if in response to her thoughts, as if it was daring her to turn around, to confront the thing that had taken Talon.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat as she turned slowly, her legs trembling. The shadows flickered at the edge of the trees, twisting and warping as Talon emerged from the darkness.

He looked the same as before—his eyes hollow, his face expressionless. He wasn’t *Talon* anymore. He was something else, something the pulse had created.

Sari’s stomach twisted. She wanted to scream, to shout at him, to beg him to come back to her. But she knew it wouldn’t work. He wasn’t there anymore.

The pulse had taken him.

Talon stopped at the edge of the clearing, his empty eyes locked on hers. “You’re part of this now,” he said, his voice low, almost gentle. “You’ve always been.”

Sari’s breath came in short, sharp gasps. “I’m not like you,” she whispered, shaking her head. “I won’t let it take me.”

Talon took a step forward, his hollow eyes glinting in the dim light. “You can’t fight it. You’ve already lost.”

Sari’s heart raced as she took a step back, her legs trembling. The cliff was right behind her. One more step and she would fall.

“You’re wrong,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I haven’t lost. Not yet.”

Talon tilted his head, his expression unreadable. “There’s no escaping it, Sari. The pulse is inside you. It’s part of you.”

Sari’s pulse quickened, matching the relentless **thump-thump** beneath her feet. She could feel the pulse tightening around her, pulling her closer to the edge, but she fought against it with everything she had.

“No,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I won’t let it take me.”

But Talon didn’t move. He just stood there, watching her, his hollow eyes filled with something she couldn’t quite name—pity, maybe. Or regret.

“You’ve already made your choice,” he said quietly. “It’s too late.”

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat as she took a final step back, her foot slipping on the loose gravel at the edge of the cliff.

She didn’t have any more choices.

---

**Chapter 14: Into the Abyss**

---

Sari fell.

For a moment, the world was nothing but a blur of darkness and motion. The wind howled in her ears as she tumbled down the side of the cliff, her arms flailing, her body twisting uncontrollably. The ground rushed up to meet her, and she hit it hard, the impact jarring every bone in her body.

She lay there for a moment, gasping for breath, the pulse still pounding in her ears. The pain was overwhelming, radiating from her ribs, her legs, her arms, but she forced herself to sit up, to look around.

The cliff loomed high above her, dark and jagged against the stormy sky. Talon was nowhere to be seen, but she knew he was still up there. Watching. Waiting.

Sari clenched her fists, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. She was still alive. She could still fight.

But the pulse was stronger here, deeper. It wasn’t just in the ground anymore—it was in the air, in the very fabric of the world around her. It pulsed through the trees, the rocks, the earth itself, a constant, unrelenting rhythm that she couldn’t escape.

She staggered to her feet, her body trembling from the effort. Every step felt like she was moving through water, the weight of the pulse pressing down on her, pulling her back.

But she wouldn’t stop. She couldn’t.

Sari stumbled forward, her legs shaking beneath her. The ground was uneven, cracked and scorched by the heat of the pulse, but she kept moving, her breath ragged in her throat.

And then, through the swirling darkness, she saw it.

A structure.

Massive and ancient, the stone monolith rose from the earth like a twisted pillar of shadow, its surface etched with symbols she couldn’t read. It stood in the center of a vast, barren plain, the ground around it blackened and scorched.

Sari’s heart raced as she moved closer. The pulse was louder here, deeper, vibrating through her body with every step she took. She could feel it pulling at her, dragging her toward the monolith, but she fought against it with every ounce of strength she had.

As she reached the base of the monolith, she collapsed to her knees, her body trembling from exhaustion and pain. The pulse was deafening now, roaring through her mind, drowning out everything else.

But she couldn’t stop. She had to keep going.

Sari reached out, her fingers brushing against the cold stone of the monolith. The moment she touched it, the pulse surged through her, stronger than ever, burning through her veins like fire.

She gasped, her body convulsing as the pulse took hold, wrapping around her heart, her lungs, her mind.

And then, slowly, the pulse began to speak.

---

**Chapter 15: The Voice of the Pulse**

---

The voice was low, guttural, and ancient. It spoke in a language she couldn’t understand, but its meaning was clear—*submit*. 

Sari’s body shook violently, her hands clinging to the monolith as if it were the only thing keeping her tethered to reality. The pulse was no longer a force in the ground, in the air—it was inside her, consuming her, pulling at her every thought, every fear, every memory.

The voice grew louder, more insistent, the words pounding through her mind like a drum. **Thump-thump. Thump-thump.** It was all-encompassing, swallowing her whole.

But somewhere, deep inside, a spark of resistance flared.

“No,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I won’t.”

The pulse’s grip tightened, pulling her deeper, pressing harder. The ancient language swirled around her, demanding submission, promising release from the pain, from the struggle. But Sari clung to that tiny spark of defiance.

“I won’t let you take me,” she gasped, her breath coming in shallow, broken sobs. “I won’t.”

But the pulse didn’t stop. It grew stronger, more relentless, its voice echoing through her mind. **Thump-thump. Thump-thump.** It was everywhere, inescapable.

Sari’s vision blurred, her body convulsing as the pulse surged through her. Her grip on the monolith loosened, her strength fading. She could feel herself slipping, falling into the abyss the pulse had created inside her.

But just as she was about to let go, a voice—familiar and faint—pierced through the roaring in her mind.

“Sari…”

Her heart stopped. It was Talon.

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Is that you?”

The voice didn’t respond, but Sari knew it was him. Somewhere, deep inside the pulse, Talon was still there. He was still fighting.

And so could she.

With a final, desperate surge of strength, Sari pulled herself away from the monolith, her body shaking violently. The pulse screamed in her mind, but she forced herself to stand, to move away from the ancient stone.

“I’m not yours,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I won’t let you take me.”

The pulse roared, its voice filled with fury and rage. The ground beneath her feet trembled, cracks forming in the earth as the pulse fought to pull her back.

But Sari kept moving. She

 didn’t know how much longer she could hold on, but she wasn’t going to give in.

She wasn’t going to lose.

---

Let's proceed by writing **Chapters 16, 17, and 18**, focusing on building toward the climax, deepening Sari’s internal and external conflicts, and leading to the final confrontation with the pulse. These chapters will reveal key elements about the pulse’s origins, force Sari to make difficult decisions, and bring Talon’s fate to its resolution.

---

**Chapter 16: The Revelation**

---

The monolith loomed above Sari, its dark surface covered in the strange symbols that seemed to pulse in rhythm with the beat in her chest. She stood trembling, the weight of exhaustion and fear pressing down on her. The pulse’s voice had been relentless, urging her to give in, to become part of something vast and incomprehensible.

But Sari wasn’t ready to surrender.

As she moved around the base of the monolith, her fingertips brushing the cold stone, something caught her eye—a crack in its surface. It was subtle, barely noticeable, but it spread from the base of the structure like a vein of weakness in the ancient rock.

Her heart raced. There was something inside.

A surge of adrenaline coursed through her as she pressed her fingers into the crack, feeling the pulse reverberate through her skin. She pushed harder, her breath coming in ragged gasps, until the crack widened with a grinding sound that made her teeth ache.

And then the stone split open.

A rush of cold air hit her as the monolith revealed what it had been hiding—a glowing, pulsating core. It was organic, alive, throbbing like a living heart encased in stone. But it was more than that—much more. The air around it vibrated with a strange energy, and the pulse inside her responded, quickening to match the rhythm.

Sari stumbled backward, her legs shaking beneath her. This was it. This was the source of everything—the pulse, the shadows, the twisted figures. And now, standing before it, she could feel its raw, undeniable power.

The voice in her head grew louder, more insistent. The pulse was calling her, urging her to join with it, to become one with its vast consciousness.

Sari fell to her knees, clutching her head. Her thoughts were unraveling, her memories blurring together. She could barely remember why she had been fighting this in the first place.

But then, through the chaos, she heard another voice—*Talon’s* voice.

“Sari…”

Her breath caught. It was faint, almost lost in the noise of the pulse, but it was there.

“Sari, don’t let it take you.”

Talon’s voice cut through the fog in her mind, and for the first time since his transformation, she felt him—*really* felt him. He was still inside the pulse, fighting, just like she was.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I’m here. I’m still here.”

The pulse roared in her mind, furious at the interruption. It pressed down on her, tightening its grip, but Sari clung to Talon’s voice. He was her anchor, her reason to resist.

And then she understood.

The pulse wasn’t just some mindless force of nature—it was a collective. A consciousness made up of countless minds, all bound together, all trapped within its power. Talon wasn’t gone. He was still in there, part of the pulse’s vast network. And so were all the others—the twisted figures, the voices she had heard. They were all prisoners.

But she wasn’t trapped. Not yet.

Sari’s hands clenched into fists as she rose to her feet, her body trembling with the effort. She could feel the pulse trying to pull her in, but she wouldn’t let it. She wouldn’t become one of them.

She had to destroy it.

---

**Chapter 17: The Final Confrontation**

---

The monolith’s core pulsed in front of her, glowing brighter with every beat, as though sensing her intent. Sari’s body ached with exhaustion, but her resolve was stronger than ever.

She couldn’t let the pulse win.

The ground beneath her feet began to tremble, cracks spreading through the scorched earth as the pulse reacted to her defiance. The energy surrounding the monolith intensified, growing wilder, more unstable. It was fighting back.

Talon’s voice echoed faintly in her mind. “Sari, you have to end this.”

Her breath hitched as she reached for the knife she had found earlier, its blade worn and jagged but sharp enough to cut. It was a small weapon against something as vast and powerful as the pulse, but it was all she had.

“I’m sorry, Talon,” she whispered, tears welling in her eyes. “I’m sorry I couldn’t save you.”

Her fingers tightened around the hilt of the knife as she approached the core, the light from the pulsating heart nearly blinding her. The pulse screamed in her mind, a cacophony of voices pleading with her, begging her to stop, but she pushed through the noise.

She raised the knife above her head, her hands shaking. The pulse’s energy was overwhelming, pressing down on her, making her doubt every move she made. But she couldn’t falter now. Not when she was so close.

And then, just as she brought the knife down toward the core, Talon’s voice broke through the chaos one last time.

“Sari, wait.”

Her heart stopped. She froze, the blade hovering inches above the core.

“I’m still here,” Talon said, his voice stronger now. “I can fight this.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. “Talon… I don’t know if—”

“You have to trust me,” he whispered. “I can help you. I can stop this, but you have to give me a chance.”

The pulse roared in fury, the ground beneath her feet shaking violently. The core flared, its light blinding, but Sari didn’t move.

She could feel him—*Talon*. He was there, somewhere deep inside the pulse, fighting to regain control. Fighting for her.

“I trust you,” Sari whispered, her voice breaking.

And then, slowly, she lowered the knife.

The pulse surged forward, its energy coiling around her like a living thing, pulling her toward the core. The voices in her mind screamed louder, their desperation palpable. But Sari focused on Talon—on the feeling of him, on the love and connection they had shared before this nightmare began.

“Talon,” she whispered. “Come back to me.”

For a long, agonizing moment, nothing happened. The pulse’s energy pressed down on her, suffocating, and she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake. But then, slowly, the energy around the monolith began to shift.

The light from the core dimmed, its once-blinding glow fading into a soft, pulsing rhythm. The ground beneath her feet steadied, the cracks in the earth closing.

And then, from within the pulse, Talon stepped forward.

He looked different—worn, weary, but his eyes… they were his eyes. The hollow emptiness was gone, replaced by something real. Something human.

“Talon,” Sari gasped, tears streaming down her face.

He smiled weakly, his body trembling as he reached for her. “You saved me.”

Sari collapsed into his arms, sobbing with relief. “I thought I lost you.”

“You never lost me,” Talon whispered, holding her close. “I was always here.”

The pulse’s voice had fallen silent, the energy surrounding the monolith now calm, almost peaceful. But Sari knew it wasn’t over yet. The pulse was still there, still a threat, waiting for its chance to rise again.

“We have to end this,” Talon said, his voice steady. “Once and for all.”

---

**Chapter 18: Aftermath**

---

The silence in the clearing was deafening.

Sari and Talon stood side by side, staring at the monolith as its light faded completely, leaving nothing but cold, dead stone. The pulse was gone—its power broken—but the weight of everything they had just endured hung heavily in the air.

Sari wiped the tears from her face, her heart still racing from the confrontation. She looked at Talon, her chest tightening at the sight of him—alive, real, and himself once again.

But he was changed. They both were.

The forest around them was eerily still, the shadows no longer flickering or shifting. The oppressive presence of the pulse had lifted, leaving behind a void that felt almost unnatural in its emptiness.

“We did it,” Sari whispered, her voice barely audible. “It’s over.”

Talon didn’t answer right away. He was staring at the monolith, his brow furrowed in thought. “For now,” he said quietly. “But the pulse… it’s more than just this place. It’s everywhere.”

Sari’s breath hitched. “What do you mean?”

Talon sighed, running a hand through his hair. “The pulse is ancient, Sari. It’s part of the earth, part of the very fabric of this world. Destroying this monolith—it weakens it, but it doesn’t erase it. There will be others.”

Sari’s stomach twisted. She had hoped—*prayed*—that this would be the end, that they could leave the forest and put all of this behind them. But now, hearing Talon’s words, she realized that the pulse’s influence ran deeper than she had ever imagined.

“So what do we do?” she asked, her voice trembling.

Talon looked at her, his expression grim. “We prepare. We make sure we’re ready for when it rises again.”

Sari swallowed hard, her

 mind racing. The thought of facing the pulse again—of losing herself to it—was almost too much to bear. But she couldn’t back down now. Not after everything they had been through.

“We’ll be ready,” she said, her voice steady.

Talon nodded, his eyes softening as he took her hand. “We’ll face it together.”

Sari squeezed his hand, her heart swelling with determination. Together, they had survived the pulse’s grip. Together, they would face whatever came next.

As they walked away from the monolith, the forest around them felt different—quieter, calmer, but not entirely free from the pulse’s lingering presence.

Sari knew their journey wasn’t over. But for now, they had won. For now, they were free.

And that was enough.

---

Let’s complete the story by writing the final two chapters, **Chapters 19 and 20**, ensuring that the conclusion is both satisfying and leaves room for potential future stories if desired. These chapters will wrap up the immediate aftermath of Sari and Talon’s battle with the pulse while hinting at larger forces at play and the lingering impact the pulse may have on their lives.

---

**Chapter 19: The Return**

---

The walk back through the forest was long and quiet. Sari and Talon moved slowly, their bodies aching with exhaustion, their minds still reeling from everything they had endured. The shadows that had once seemed alive, twisting and flickering with the pulse’s energy, were now still. The oppressive heat had lifted, replaced by a cool, eerie calm that made the forest feel hollow.

Sari’s thoughts were a whirlwind of emotions—relief, fear, and a deep, aching sadness. They had won, at least for now, but the weight of everything that had happened pressed down on her like a leaden blanket. She kept glancing at Talon, half-expecting to see that hollow look in his eyes again, but it wasn’t there. He was here. Really here.

But he was different, and she knew she was too.

As they reached the edge of the forest, where the trees thinned and the sky opened up above them, Sari stopped. The sight of the open landscape beyond the trees should have brought her some sense of relief, but instead, it felt strange, foreign, like a world she no longer belonged to.

Talon turned to face her, his brow furrowed. “What is it?”

Sari stared at the horizon, her heart heavy. “I don’t know how to go back to normal after this. How do we just… walk away from everything that’s happened?”

Talon was silent for a moment, his eyes dark with thought. “We don’t go back to normal,” he said quietly. “Not after this. We change. We adapt.”

Sari swallowed hard, her throat tight. “But what if it’s not enough? What if the pulse… what if it comes back?”

Talon stepped closer, his hand reaching for hers. “We’ll be ready,” he said, his voice steady. “Next time, we’ll know what we’re up against. We’ll fight it together.”

Sari squeezed his hand, the warmth of his touch grounding her in the present. She nodded, though doubt still gnawed at the edges of her mind. The pulse was powerful—*ancient*—and now that she knew its influence ran deeper than she had ever imagined, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this was far from over.

But for now, they were free.

“We should go,” Talon said, glancing at the sky. “It’s getting late.”

Sari hesitated for a moment, her eyes lingering on the trees behind them. The forest felt like it was watching them, waiting for something. But she turned away, following Talon as they made their way back into the world beyond the pulse’s reach.

For now.

**Chapter 20: Epilogue**

---

One Year Later

The wind rustled through the tall grass, carrying with it the scent of pine and damp earth. Sari stood at the edge of the clearing, her eyes scanning the treeline, looking for signs of life. The forest hadn’t changed much in the year since she and Talon had fought the pulse—it still loomed large and ominous, a reminder of everything they had faced.

But something was different now. The pulse was gone, at least from this place, but its absence didn’t feel like a victory. It felt like a pause, a moment of quiet before something bigger.

Talon approached from behind, his footsteps soft against the ground. He had recovered physically from his time within the pulse, but Sari knew that there were scars left behind, ones that wouldn’t heal so easily. They both carried those scars.

“Thinking about it again?” Talon asked, his voice low.

Sari nodded, her arms crossed over her chest. “It never really leaves me.”

He stood beside her, his gaze also fixed on the forest. “I know.”

For a long time, they stood in silence, the wind the only sound between them. The world beyond the forest had moved on, oblivious to the danger that had once lurked so close. But Sari and Talon had never forgotten. The pulse was still out there—somewhere—waiting, watching.

“Do you think it will come back?” Sari asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon was quiet for a moment, then he sighed. “I don’t know. But if it does, we’ll be ready.”

Sari turned to face him, her eyes searching his face for any sign of doubt. But Talon’s gaze was steady, his expression resolute. They had faced the pulse together, and they had survived. Whatever came next, they would face it the same way.

Together.

“I’ve been thinking,” Sari said, her voice stronger now. “Maybe we should start preparing… just in case. We can’t be the only ones who’ve encountered the pulse. There might be others out there. People who need help.”

Talon looked at her, his brow furrowing slightly. “What are you saying?”

Sari took a deep breath, her mind racing with ideas. “We could… track it. Study it. Find out where it’s hiding, where it might strike next. Maybe we can stop it before it gets too strong.”

Talon’s eyes widened slightly, and for a moment, he didn’t speak. But then, slowly, a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. “You want to go looking for trouble, don’t you?”

Sari smiled back, though there was a seriousness in her eyes. “It’s not trouble. It’s protection. We know what it’s capable of, Talon. We can’t just sit around waiting for it to find us again.”

Talon nodded, his smile fading into something more determined. “You’re right. If we’re going to stop it for good, we can’t wait around. We need to find it first.”

Sari’s heart raced with a mixture of fear and excitement. She knew this wasn’t over—not really. The pulse was still out there, and the thought of facing it again terrified her. But this time, they wouldn’t be running. This time, they would be hunting it.

Together.

Sari glanced at the forest one last time before turning to Talon. “Let’s get started.”

Talon nodded, taking her hand as they walked away from the clearing and back toward their new future. The wind whispered through the trees behind them, but they didn’t look back.

They were ready for whatever came next.
