**Chapter 2: The Cabin**

"Talon!" Sari’s voice cracked as she stumbled toward the cabin, her breath coming in ragged bursts. The forest had swallowed her whole, and now, even as she stood at the rotting threshold of the place they once called a refuge, it felt like the last breath of a dream long gone.

The cabin—**their cabin**—was broken. Just like him.

The walls sagged inward, the wood warped as though it had been **twisted by unseen hands**. The windows, once brimming with sunlight, were shattered, the glass scattered across the floor like splinters of lost hope. **Decay hung in the air**, a stench of rot and something darker—something alive. The Pulse.

She felt it. **Everywhere**. It wasn’t just inside the cabin—it was inside her, creeping into the edges of her mind, feeding on her doubts, her fear. It whispered to her with every breath she took. *Too late.*

Sari’s heart pounded, her hands trembling as she stepped inside. The air was thick, pressing down on her like a weight she couldn’t shake. Every creak of the floorboards echoed through the empty room, making her flinch. This place had once been their haven. Now, it was a tomb.

But **Talon was here**. He had to be.

“Please, Talon,” she whispered, her voice barely audible as she moved deeper into the room. “I’m here. I came back for you.”

Her fingers grazed the remnants of the wooden doorframe, the splinters catching at her skin. She ignored the pain. Nothing else mattered. **Talon was what mattered**.

And then she saw him.

He stood by the shattered window, his back to her. For a moment, hope surged through her chest—he was still standing, still here. But something was wrong. His silhouette wavered, as though the air around him was alive, warping, distorting his form.

"Talon," she whispered, taking a step forward. **He didn’t move**.

Her heart raced, pounding so loudly in her ears that it drowned out the creaking cabin. She took another step, and then another, reaching out with trembling fingers. "Talon..."

Slowly, he turned to face her, and the world seemed to stop.

His face—**the face she had loved**—was gone. **Black veins twisted beneath his skin**, crawling like a living thing. His eyes were dark, hollow, **swallowed by the Pulse**. There was no light left in them, no recognition. 

“Talon...” Her voice broke, barely a whisper now.

She moved closer, unable to stop herself, her hand reaching for him. **He couldn’t be gone**. Not like this. But as her fingers brushed against his arm, he recoiled violently, his body jerking away as if her touch burned him.

“Talon, please,” she begged, her voice cracking with desperation. **“I know you’re still in there. You can fight this.”**

But as she looked at him, her heart sank. **The man she had known was gone**. The Pulse had taken him—twisted him into something unrecognizable. The veins beneath his skin pulsed, black and malevolent, spreading further, reaching toward his neck.

She gripped his arm tighter, refusing to let go, but as she did, **a sliver of doubt crept in**. Was she doing this for him—or for herself? Was she holding onto the past because she couldn’t bear the thought of facing the future alone? **What if she was making it worse?**

Her breath caught in her throat, tears welling in her eyes. “Please, Talon,” she whispered, “come back to me.”

For a moment—just a moment—his eyes flickered. The darkness receded, and **there he was**. Talon. **Her Talon**. His lips parted as if to speak, and she could see him fighting, trying to break through the Pulse’s hold.

Her heart leapt. “Talon! I’m here! I’m with you.”

But then the moment shattered.

**The Pulse surged**.

Talon’s body convulsed violently, his back arching as the black veins twisted tighter, wrapping around him like chains. His limbs jerked, and a low, primal scream tore from his throat. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the floor, the Pulse tightening its grip on him with every second.

“No!” Sari screamed, dropping to her knees beside him. “Talon, **fight it!**”

She grabbed his hand, but it was ice cold. **He wasn’t there anymore**.

---

The Pulse was everywhere now, filling the room like a living, breathing entity. It wasn’t just taking Talon—it was coming for her too.

A dark tendril of blackness snaked through the air, slithering toward her. Sari barely managed to pull away before it brushed her arm, but she could feel the chill of it, **the hunger**, as it reached for her.

*You’re too late*, the Pulse whispered, its voice curling through her mind like poison. *He’s gone. And soon, you will be too.*

Sari gasped, her breath coming in short, panicked bursts as she watched the blackness spread further through Talon’s body. His limbs twitched, his chest heaving with ragged breaths, but he was slipping away—**fading** before her eyes.

Her hands shook as she clutched him tighter. **What was she doing?** Was she really trying to save him—or was she just holding onto a memory? A part of her, deep down, whispered that maybe she should let him go. Maybe he was already lost.

But she couldn’t. **Not yet.**

With a cry of desperation, she gripped his arm harder, her voice trembling. “I won’t lose you. **Not like this.**”

But the Pulse was winning. The cabin groaned around them, the walls trembling as cracks splintered through the wood. **It was all falling apart**.

Sari’s mind raced. **What could she do?** If she stayed, the Pulse would take her too. But if she left... she couldn’t leave him behind. **Not after everything**.

The Pulse’s tendrils wrapped tighter around Talon’s body, pulling him deeper, faster. His chest convulsed, his limbs jerking violently as the veins twisted further, consuming him.

“Talon...” Her voice was barely more than a breath, her heart breaking. She couldn’t let him go. She couldn’t. But as she looked at him, her hand trembling against his cold skin, the doubt gnawed at her. **Was it him anymore?**

She had to make a choice.

---

The cabin groaned again, louder this time, the floor beneath them splintering as the Pulse’s darkness seeped through the cracks, curling toward her. **Time was running out**.

Sari’s breath came in short, panicked bursts as she looked down at Talon’s still form. His body was limp now, his eyes closed, the veins pulsing beneath his skin. **The Pulse had him**.

But as she held him, something flickered—**a twitch**. His hand moved, barely perceptible, but it was there.

Her heart leapt in her chest. “Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling with hope. “Can you hear me?”

For a moment, his eyelids fluttered, and his lips parted. His voice was faint, barely a breath, but it was him. **“Sari...”**

Her tears fell freely now, her heart pounding in her chest. **He was still in there**.

“I’m here,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m right here. Don’t leave me. Please, don’t leave me.”

But just as quickly as the moment had come, it was gone. Talon’s body jerked violently, the Pulse surging again, the veins tightening their grip. His eyes rolled back, and his body convulsed, the darkness consuming him once more.

Sari’s heart broke. **She couldn’t lose him. Not again.**

With one last burst of strength, she pulled him into her arms, his body heavy and limp. Her muscles screamed in protest, her lungs burning with every breath, but she didn’t stop. **She couldn’t stop**.

The Pulse howled, its dark tendrils reaching out, but Sari pushed forward, her heart racing, her mind screaming. **She wasn’t going to let it take him.**

Not now. **Not ever.**

**Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

“Wake up, damn it!” Sari’s voice was raw, breaking the suffocating silence that hung over the cabin like a shroud. She shook Talon’s lifeless form, her fingers digging into his cold skin. Her heart hammered in her chest, each beat slower, heavier—**more final**.

**He couldn’t be gone**. Not now. Not like this.

Her breath hitched as she pulled him closer, pressing her forehead against his. His skin was icy, his body limp in her arms, but she refused to believe it. **There had to be something left.**

“Talon... please,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “You have to come back. **You promised me**. You said we’d get through this.”

But the only response was the groaning of the cabin as the walls buckled under the weight of the Pulse’s dark influence. **Everything was collapsing**, the cabin, Talon, their future—it was all crumbling around her, slipping through her fingers like sand.

The Pulse pressed in from every direction, suffocating the air with its presence, its whispers threading through her mind like poison. *He’s gone, Sari. You’re too late.*

She shook her head, her tears falling onto his chest. “No,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “I won’t lose you. **I can’t lose you.**”

Her fingers grazed his cheek, and for a second—a fleeting second—she thought she felt a spark of warmth beneath his skin. Her breath caught in her throat, hope surging through her chest.

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. “Are you still there?”

His body twitched.

Sari froze, her heart pounding, disbelief flooding her veins. **No. It couldn’t be.** She held her breath, watching his face, her hands trembling as she cradled him. But then his chest rose—just slightly—and his lips parted.

“Sari...” The word was faint, broken, but it was him. **It was really him.**

Her heart leapt. “I’m here,” she whispered, choking on her tears. “I’m right here. Please, Talon, fight it. **Come back to me.**”

For a moment, his eyes fluttered open, and she saw him—**really saw him**. The darkness in his eyes had receded, the black veins pulsing beneath his skin seemed to fade. He looked at her, weak, fragile, but **alive**.

“I...” His voice cracked, his breath ragged, but his gaze stayed fixed on hers. “There’s a way, Sari... a way to stop this.”

Her hands tightened around his, her heart pounding in her chest. “Tell me,” she whispered. “Please, just tell me. What do I have to do?”

But before he could answer, his body convulsed violently, his limbs jerking as the black veins surged back, tightening their grip. His eyes rolled back, and the Pulse **snapped him back into its grasp**.

“No!” Sari screamed, grabbing his shoulders as he writhed in her arms. “Talon, **don’t let go!**”

But the Pulse wasn’t finished. The darkness twisted around him, pulling him deeper, faster. His body shook with violent spasms, his breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps as the veins consumed him again.

Sari’s heart raced, panic clawing at her chest. **What was she supposed to do?** Talon had told her there was a way—a way to stop it. But now, his voice was gone, swallowed by the Pulse’s insidious grasp. The cabin trembled around them, the walls cracking and groaning as if the Pulse was pulling it apart piece by piece.

And then she felt it—**the Pulse reaching for her**.

A tendril of darkness snaked through the air, curling around her wrist, its cold touch sending a shock of pain up her arm. She gasped, recoiling, but the Pulse tightened its grip, its voice slithering through her mind. *You can’t save him. You’ve already lost.*

“No,” Sari whispered, pulling against the Pulse’s hold, but it was like fighting a current, dragging her deeper into its darkness. **It wasn’t just taking him—it was taking her too**. She could feel it now, creeping into her thoughts, whispering her doubts back to her, feeding on her fear.

Her lungs burned as she fought against it, her mind racing. **If she stayed, it would take her too**. The Pulse wouldn’t stop until it consumed everything—her, Talon, the cabin—everything they had built, everything they had loved.

But she couldn’t leave him. **Not like this**.

Her hands trembled as she gripped Talon tighter, her tears falling onto his skin. “Talon... I need you,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Please, come back to me. I can’t do this without you.”

The Pulse tightened its grip around her wrist, pulling her down, **closer to the edge**. Her vision blurred, her strength fading, but she refused to let go. **She wouldn’t lose him again**.

But as she looked at him—his body convulsing, the black veins crawling further up his neck—**the doubt crept in again**. Was she holding onto something that wasn’t there anymore? Was she fighting a battle she had already lost?

Her breath hitched, her mind screaming at her to run, to save herself, but she couldn’t. **She couldn’t leave him**.

Suddenly, Talon’s body jerked again, his back arching as the Pulse surged one final time. His eyes snapped open, and for a moment—just for a moment—they were clear again.

“Sari...” His voice was weak, barely audible, but it was him. **It was still him**.

Her heart shattered at the sound of his voice, but before she could speak, the Pulse tightened its grip, and Talon’s body went limp in her arms.

“No...” Sari whispered, her breath coming in shallow bursts. “No, no, no...”

The cabin groaned louder now, the floor beneath them splintering, the walls cracking as the Pulse’s influence consumed everything. **It was all falling apart**.

Sari’s chest tightened, her breath catching in her throat. **What was she supposed to do?** She couldn’t stay here—the Pulse was too strong. But she couldn’t leave him. **Not like this**.

*Let him go, Sari.* The Pulse’s voice slithered through her mind, cold and cruel. *You can’t save him. You’ve already lost him. Let him go.*

Her hands shook, her tears falling freely now as she cradled Talon’s lifeless form. “I won’t lose you,” she whispered, her voice breaking. **But even as she said the words, she knew—they were a lie.**

The Pulse was right. She had already lost him. **Talon was gone**.

---

But then—**something shifted**.

Talon’s fingers twitched in her grasp, barely perceptible, but it was enough. Her breath caught in her throat as she looked down at him, her heart pounding. **Could it be?**

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Can you hear me?”

For a moment, nothing happened. But then his chest rose—just slightly—and his eyes fluttered open once more. His gaze locked on hers, weak, fragile, but **real**.

“Sari...” His voice was broken, but it was him. **It was really him.**

Her tears fell faster, her heart racing as she held him tighter. “I’m here,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m not leaving you. **I’ll never leave you.**”

But the Pulse wasn’t finished. The darkness twisted around his body, pulling him deeper, tightening its grip on both of them. The cabin groaned, the walls shuddering as cracks splintered through the foundation. **Time was running out**.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she looked down at Talon. **She had to make a choice**. If she stayed, the Pulse would take them both. But if she left... if she left, Talon would be lost forever.

Her hands shook as she cradled his face, her tears blurring her vision. “Talon... what do I do?” she whispered, her voice breaking. **“Tell me what to do.”**

His eyes fluttered open one last time, and his lips parted. “You have to... let go.”

Her breath caught in her throat, her heart breaking at his words. **Let go?** How could she let him go? How could she leave him behind after everything they had been through?

But as she looked into his eyes, she knew. **He was right**.

With one last, shuddering breath, she pulled him into her arms, her body trembling with the effort. **She wasn’t ready to let go—but she had to.**

“I love you,” she whispered, her tears falling onto his skin. “I’ll always love you.”

And then, with one final

, agonizing cry, she released him, letting his body slip from her grasp as the Pulse consumed him, pulling him deeper into the darkness.

The cabin groaned one last time, the walls shattering as the Pulse’s influence spread further, **collapsing the world around her**. Sari’s breath came in short, ragged bursts as she stumbled toward the door, her heart breaking with every step. But she didn’t stop. **She couldn’t stop**.

The Pulse howled behind her, but Sari pushed forward, her tears blinding her as she ran. **She wasn’t going to let it take her too**.

Not now. **Not ever**.
