**Chapter 1: The Pulse Awakens**

The night was still, a rare kind of stillness that pressed down on the town of Brookridge like a wet blanket. The wind, which usually whispered through the trees, had gone silent. Every branch, every leaf, seemed to hold its breath. Inside his small, weather-beaten home, Talon Mercer sat by the window, fingers tracing the edges of his barometer. He squinted at the sky, its pitch-black expanse punctuated by distant stars. He knew something was coming. The air was too thick with tension, and the clouds on the horizon were gathering like a pack of wolves.

As he stood, preparing to jot down his findings in his battered journal, it hit him.

A pulse.

It was subtle at first, a slight tremor beneath his feet, as if the earth itself had stirred in its sleep. He frowned and checked the barometer again. Still nothing abnormal. But the feeling lingered—a dull, throbbing sensation that crawled up from his feet into his chest. It wasn’t painful, not yet. Just... unsettling.

In the town square, Sari Greysun was locking up her small antiques shop. She had spent the evening rearranging her collection of postcards, an almost meditative ritual she performed whenever her mind felt too crowded. Tonight was one of those nights. She’d been restless, her hands twitching to fidget with her long, dark hair every few minutes. As she slid the key into the lock, she paused.

There it was again.

A beat, low and distant, like the slow drum of a heart buried deep underground. She pressed her palm flat against the wooden door and closed her eyes. The pulse seemed to sync with her heartbeat, a rhythm too perfectly timed to be mere coincidence.

Sari pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders and hurried home, glancing over her shoulder more than once, even though the streets were empty. *This town was never empty.* Not truly. Not until tonight.

***

Across town, Dystiny Smith sat in her apartment, headphones plugged into her phone, coloring furiously on a blank sheet of paper with neon markers. She didn’t know what she was drawing—didn’t care, either. It was the act that soothed her, the bright chaotic strokes on the page, almost enough to drown out the chaos in her mind. Almost.

A shiver ran up her spine, interrupting the comfort of her coloring. The air around her felt wrong, thick with something unnameable. Dystiny froze, markers poised above the paper, and slowly reached up to tug her headphones out of her ears.

Silence.

No music, no wind, no hum from the streetlights outside. She tilted her head, listening. Her breath caught as the pulse vibrated through the floor beneath her, rattling the pencils on her desk. The pulse was growing stronger, a steady beat now, like a war drum. *When I find myself in times of trouble... Mother Mary comes to me...* 

The lyrics echoed in her mind as if her subconscious had conjured them to drown out the growing tension. Dystiny stood abruptly, knocking over a cup of pens in the process, and darted to the window. The pulse was almost deafening now, reverberating through her bones.

Outside, the town was still—unnaturally so. She pressed her palm to the glass. The pulse surged through her, a deep, almost primal connection. She could feel it in her head now, like it was drawing her somewhere, calling her name.

A sharp knock on her door snapped her back to reality. She jumped and cursed under her breath. Who would be visiting at this hour?

***

On the other side of town, Father Nathan O'Connell knelt at the altar of St. Joseph's Church, his hands clasped in fervent prayer. The candles flickered unnaturally, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch and twist across the walls. He had felt it earlier, too. The pulse. His dreams had been darker these past few weeks, filled with cryptic visions of a great shadow covering the town. He couldn’t shake the feeling that this was connected—that his dreams were a warning.

“Lord, grant us your protection,” he whispered, his voice shaky for the first time in years. 

The pulse hummed beneath his knees, like the heartbeat of some great beast slumbering below the earth. The walls of the church seemed to shift in time with the beat, the wooden pews creaking as if alive. Father Nathan stood abruptly, his hands trembling. *Was this the Lord’s doing? Or something else entirely?*

He glanced toward the stained-glass window at the front of the church, where the light of the full moon bathed the image of the Virgin Mary in a cold, eerie glow. The pulse felt wrong. Evil. His gut twisted as the silence thickened around him.

Father Nathan turned toward the door. Whatever this was, he needed to warn the others. The town had to be prepared.

***

Talon stood at the edge of the woods, staring into the dense thicket. He had followed the pulse here, like a moth to a flame, though he wasn’t entirely sure why. The barometer in his hand flickered wildly now, the needle jumping from left to right. But there was no storm. No physical change in the atmosphere. He furrowed his brow.

“What the hell is going on?”

A rustle of leaves behind him made him whirl around, his hand instinctively reaching for the hunting knife at his belt. 

Sari stepped out from the trees, her wide eyes locking onto his.

“Did you feel it too?” she asked breathlessly, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

Talon nodded, his grip tightening on the knife. “It’s not natural.”

“No,” Sari agreed, glancing over her shoulder as if expecting something to leap out of the shadows. “It’s... alive.”

Before either of them could say more, Dystiny emerged from the opposite side of the clearing, her face pale, eyes darting around as if trying to make sense of what she was seeing. 

“Do you feel like it’s pulling you?” Dystiny asked, her voice unsteady. “Like... like it’s in your head?”

Sari shivered and nodded, while Talon’s jaw clenched. 

“We need to figure out where it’s coming from,” Talon said, his voice resolute. 

Father Nathan appeared at the edge of the clearing, his robes flapping in the sudden breeze that had picked up. His face was pale, but his eyes were filled with a fiery conviction.

“This is a test,” he declared, his voice louder than it needed to be. “We must prepare ourselves. The Lord has sent us this challenge.”

“Or something else has,” Dystiny muttered, glancing nervously at Sari.

The group stood in uneasy silence as the pulse grew stronger, resonating through their very bones.

Brookridge was changing. And none of them knew how—or if—they would survive it.

---

**Chapter 2: Unsettling Changes**

The pulse didn’t stop. Instead, it intensified with every passing hour. The once serene streets of Brookridge now seemed to shift subtly under its weight. By morning, Talon woke to a sky that was a shade too pale, the air too still, as if the world itself had paused.

He rubbed his eyes and reached for his barometer. The needle was stuck. It refused to move, no matter how much he tapped the glass. Frowning, he threw on his jacket and stepped outside. The sound of the pulse was still there, vibrating beneath his boots, more insistent than ever.

The town square was deserted. The usual bustle of morning life—people heading to the market, children playing in the park—was absent. Instead, a strange hush blanketed everything. Talon could feel it under his skin, an itch he couldn’t scratch.

Across the square, Sari stood at the door of her shop, her eyes distant. She’d been awake all night, her thoughts twisted by a barrage of unsettling dreams—dreams where the pulse whispered to her, showing her fragments of memories she’d long forgotten, places she’d never been but could almost recall.

Talon approached her, his face unreadable. “It’s worse,” he said simply.

Sari nodded, brushing her hair back. “I don’t know what’s happening, Talon. I feel... wrong. Like something’s inside me. I can’t sleep. I keep having these dreams—dreams that don’t feel like mine.”

Talon clenched his jaw. “I had them too. So did Dystiny.”

Sari shuddered. “This isn’t just us. Something’s happening to the whole town.”

Just as she spoke, they both heard it: a low, guttural growl from the alleyway behind the shop. Talon’s instincts kicked in immediately. He motioned for Sari to stay put as he crept toward the sound. His hand hovered over his knife, his every muscle tense.

What he saw made his breath catch.

A stray dog, its fur matted and its eyes wild, staggered into view. Its movements were erratic, as if it was being tugged in different directions by invisible strings. The dog’s mouth hung open, drool dripping from its jaws, and its body convulsed with each step.

“Jesus,” Talon muttered, backing away slowly.

The dog stopped. Its head jerked up, locking its bloodshot eyes onto Talon. For a moment, they stood frozen in a silent standoff, the pulse drumming louder and louder in Talon’s ears. Then, without warning, the dog bolted away, disappearing into the shadows of the alley.

Talon exhaled sharply and turned back to Sari, his face pale.

“Animals too,” he said quietly. “It’s affecting them.”

Sari wrapped her arms around herself. “What do we do?”

“We find out what’s causing this,” Talon replied, his voice firm. “We need to get Dystiny. She knows something’s wrong.”

***

Dystiny was already awake when they arrived at her apartment. She hadn’t slept since the pulse started. Her mind was a whirlwind, fragments of song lyrics and broken dreams swirling around, too chaotic to make sense of. She hadn’t been able to focus on anything except the ever-present thrum of the pulse, which seemed to fill her head with noise.

When she opened the door to Talon and Sari, her eyes were wide, manic. “You feel it too,” she said without preamble. It wasn’t a question.

Talon nodded. “We need to figure out what’s going on. It’s spreading.”

Dystiny laughed, a short, sharp sound that held no humor. “Spreading? Oh, it’s doing more than that. It’s... warping everything.”

She gestured wildly to the room behind her. Papers were scattered everywhere, colored drawings covering the walls in haphazard patterns. It was like someone had tried to map out the inside of her mind. “I’ve been trying to piece it together. But it’s too fast. Too loud. The pulse is in everything now.”

Sari stepped forward, her face softening with concern. “Dystiny, you need to calm down. We’re all feeling it, but we have to stay focused.”

“I’m *trying*,” Dystiny snapped, her hands shaking. “But every time I close my eyes, I see... things. Things that don’t make sense. I think the pulse is in our dreams too.”

“I’ve had them,” Talon said, folding his arms. “Sari too. They’re not just dreams. It’s like... the pulse is talking to us.”

Dystiny’s expression faltered, and for a brief moment, her manic energy seemed to collapse. “Talking? What is it saying?”

Talon shook his head. “I don’t know yet. But we need to find out.”

Before anyone could say more, a loud crash echoed from outside. All three of them ran to the window. In the distance, a group of people had gathered in the square, shouting, pushing. Two men were grappling with each other in front of the town’s fountain, while others stood frozen, watching with wide eyes.

The pulse had intensified, its invisible grip twisting people’s emotions, warping their behavior.

“They’re losing it,” Sari whispered.

Talon gritted his teeth. “We need to get them inside before things get worse.”

Dystiny grabbed her coat and followed the others out the door. As they approached the square, the scene became clearer. People were arguing, their faces contorted with fear and confusion. Some were yelling about the pulse being a sign of the end times, while others blamed it on the town’s factories or government.

At the center of the chaos stood Father Nathan O’Connell, his arms raised in a futile attempt to calm the crowd. His voice rang out over the din, strained but authoritative.

“This is a test, my friends! We must not succumb to fear! The Lord has a plan, and we must trust in His guidance!”

But the crowd wasn’t listening. The pulse was too strong, its influence too deep. Talon, Sari, and Dystiny pushed their way through the mass of bodies, trying to reach Father Nathan.

“Father!” Sari called out, grabbing his arm. “We need to get everyone inside. It’s not safe out here.”

Father Nathan’s eyes were wild, his calm façade cracking under the pressure. “This is judgment, Sari. The pulse... it’s testing our faith.”

“No, it’s not,” Talon interrupted, his voice harsh. “It’s messing with our minds. You can feel it, can’t you? This isn’t divine.”

Father Nathan shook his head stubbornly. “I refuse to believe that. The Lord does not abandon us in times of need.”

But before they could argue further, a sharp scream pierced the air.

The crowd parted as a woman stumbled forward, her face twisted in horror. Her hands were covered in blood, but it wasn’t her own. Behind her, a man lay on the ground, motionless, his head twisted at an unnatural angle. The pulse had claimed its first victim.

For a moment, there was only silence. Then, all at once, the square erupted into chaos.

Sari grabbed Dystiny’s arm, pulling her back toward the safety of the shop. “We need to go!”

Talon nodded, his mind racing. “This is just the beginning. The pulse... it’s not just in our heads anymore. It’s changing the town.”

As they retreated, the pulse grew louder, more insistent, echoing in their ears like a countdown to something terrible.

---

**Chapter 3: The First Expedition**

Talon's breath clouded in the cold morning air as he knelt at the edge of the forest. The pulse was stronger here, deep in the woods where the trees crowded out the sky. It was as if the pulse had a physical presence now, a heavy thrum that pressed down on him like a weight. His fingers brushed the earth, feeling its vibrations. They weren’t far from something. *Something alive.*

Behind him, Sari adjusted her backpack nervously. Her breath was quick, her eyes darting around the shadows between the trees. “Are you sure about this? The deeper we go, the worse it’s going to get.”

Talon stood, brushing dirt from his hands. “We need answers. Staying in town is a death sentence.”

Sari bit her lip, glancing at Dystiny, who stood a few feet away, absently chewing on her fingernails. Dystiny hadn’t said much since they’d left the square earlier that morning. The chaos in town had shaken her in a way that even the pulse hadn’t, and now she was quiet, lost in her thoughts, her neon markers tucked away in her jacket like a lifeline.

“We should stick together,” Dystiny muttered, half to herself, half to the group. “Whatever’s out there, it’s not going to wait for us to figure it out.”

Talon nodded. “That’s why we’re here.”

Father Nathan had refused to come. He’d gone back to the church to pray, convinced that faith alone could save the town. Talon wasn’t so sure. The pulse wasn’t something that could be prayed away. It was something ancient, something far beyond what any of them could comprehend. And it was growing stronger by the hour.

The three of them moved deeper into the woods, the trees growing thicker, the air colder. The pulse was like a drumbeat now, rhythmic and slow, but unmistakably alive. It was almost as if the ground beneath them was breathing.

“Do you feel that?” Sari asked quietly, her eyes wide as she stopped in her tracks.

Talon turned, narrowing his eyes. “Feel what?”

“It’s... pulling us,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s like it wants us to find it.”

Dystiny shook her head, hugging her arms to her chest. “I feel it too. It’s like... it’s in my head.”

Talon’s jaw clenched. He didn’t like where this was going, but they couldn’t turn back now. Not when they were so close.

They pushed forward, the trees eventually giving way to a clearing. At the center, half-buried in the earth, was an object unlike anything they had ever seen. It pulsed faintly, the same rhythm they had felt all along. The ground around it seemed warped, as if reality itself was bending in response to the object’s presence.

Talon knelt beside it, his hand hovering just above its surface. It was cold to the touch, even though the air around it was unnaturally warm. The pulse thrummed louder now, reverberating through his bones.

“We shouldn’t be here,” Dystiny whispered, her voice barely audible. “This is wrong. This thing... it’s not natural.”

“I know,” Talon replied, his eyes locked on the object. It was smooth, metallic, but there were no seams, no sign of how it had gotten here. “But this is what’s causing the pulse. I’m sure of it.”

Sari took a step back, her hands trembling. “If we touch it, what happens?”

Talon didn’t answer right away. His fingers hovered closer, almost touching the surface. The pulse felt stronger now, more insistent. It was like the object was calling out to him, pulling him closer.

Before he could stop himself, his fingers brushed the metal.

The world exploded.

A blinding flash of light surged from the object, knocking Talon off his feet. He hit the ground hard, gasping as the air was forced from his lungs. His vision blurred, and for a moment, all he could hear was the deafening roar of the pulse, amplified a thousand times.

Then, as quickly as it had started, the light faded.

Talon groaned, blinking rapidly as he sat up. The clearing looked the same, but something was different. The air felt... heavier. Time itself seemed to have bent around them. He glanced at Sari and Dystiny, who were both on the ground, struggling to regain their bearings.

“What the hell was that?” Dystiny rasped, rubbing her temples.

Talon shook his head, still trying to make sense of what had just happened. “I don’t know. But it wasn’t good.”

Sari pulled herself to her feet, her face pale. “We need to get out of here. This... whatever this is, it’s changing things. Warping reality.”

Talon stood, his muscles aching. He glanced back at the object, its surface now dull, the pulse fainter but still present. “We have to tell the others. This thing is dangerous.”

Dystiny shot him a sharp look. “Tell them what? That we found some alien artifact in the middle of the woods and it nearly fried our brains? They’ll think we’re insane.”

“She’s right,” Sari added, her voice trembling. “If we tell the town, they’ll panic. They’re already on edge. This will push them over.”

Talon frowned, running a hand through his hair. “So what? We just keep it a secret?”

Dystiny crossed her arms, her eyes dark and serious. “Maybe we should. At least until we figure out what we’re dealing with. We don’t even know what this thing is.”

Talon considered her words, the weight of the situation pressing down on him. The pulse had already claimed one life back in town. If they revealed what they’d found, it could cause a mass hysteria. But keeping it hidden? That felt wrong. Dangerous, even.

“We can’t let it stay here,” Talon said finally. “If it’s this powerful, it’s only going to get worse.”

“Worse how?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted. “But we can’t ignore it. If the pulse is tied to this thing, then it’s not just going to go away.”

They stood in tense silence, the weight of their discovery settling on them like a lead blanket. The pulse continued to thrum faintly in the background, a constant reminder that whatever they had found was still alive, still watching.

“We need more information,” Dystiny said, breaking the silence. “There has to be someone who knows about this kind of thing. A scientist. Or... I don’t know, someone.”

Talon nodded, though his mind was racing. He thought of Father Nathan, of the religious conviction that had kept the priest from joining them. Would he see this as another test of faith? Or something far darker?

“We’ll figure it out,” Talon said, though the words felt hollow in his mouth. He glanced one last time at the object, its surface now cool and still, before turning to lead them back to town.

But deep in his gut, Talon knew this was only the beginning. The pulse wasn’t just a warning. It was a harbinger.

And whatever it was bringing... they weren’t ready.

---

**Chapter 4: Disappearance**

The sky hung heavy over Brookridge, a slate gray mass that seemed to trap the town beneath its weight. It was quiet again, the stillness broken only by the faint, ever-present hum of the pulse. Talon, Sari, and Dystiny returned from the woods in silence, the weight of their discovery pressing down on their shoulders like a secret too dark to share.

Talon had barely slept. Every time he closed his eyes, flashes of light, twisted shapes, and echoes of that unnatural energy from the object haunted him. He’d wake in a cold sweat, the pulse thrumming beneath his skin, reminding him that it was still out there, waiting.

The others weren’t faring much better. Sari sat in her shop, staring blankly at the postcards she had once cherished. The images of serene beaches and quiet countryside villages now seemed alien, as if they belonged to a world far removed from their own. Her hands trembled as she tried to arrange them, but she couldn’t focus. Her mind kept drifting back to the clearing, to the moment when Talon had touched the object.

Dystiny, for her part, was quiet. Too quiet. She sat at the diner, nursing a cup of coffee she didn’t drink, her markers forgotten in her bag. Every so often, her fingers would twitch as if reaching for them, but she never pulled them out. The pulse echoed in her head, louder now, a drumbeat that wouldn’t let up.

“What do we do now?” Sari had asked them when they parted ways after returning to town. But no one had an answer. Not yet.

***

The day passed in a haze, time slipping by in a way that felt wrong. Hours bled into one another, and by the time the sun began to set, Talon realized he had barely moved from his spot by the window. He stared out at the empty street, waiting. For what, he didn’t know.

When the knock came at his door, it startled him out of his trance. He stood, his muscles stiff, and opened it to find Sari standing there, pale and wide-eyed.

“Talon,” she said, her voice thin, almost fragile. “Something’s wrong.”

He didn’t need to ask what. He could see it in her face.

“It’s Dystiny,” Sari continued, wringing her hands. “She’s gone.”

Talon’s stomach dropped. “Gone? What do you mean, gone?”

“She... she went back to the woods,” Sari whispered. “I went to check on her at the diner, but no one’s seen her since this afternoon. I found her jacket in the clearing.”

Talon’s mind raced. “Why would she go back? We agreed we wouldn’t...”

Sari shook her head, tears brimming in her eyes. “I don’t know. But something’s wrong. I can feel it.”

The pulse throbbed louder, as if mocking them. Talon grabbed his coat and nodded to Sari. “Let’s go.”

***

The woods were darker now, the shadows longer, the trees seeming to close in on them as they made their way to the clearing. The pulse had grown stronger here, its rhythm almost erratic, as if the object was waking up. The wind rustled the leaves, but there was no sound beyond that—no birds, no animals, just the pulse and the creaking of branches.

“Do you see anything?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon shook his head. His eyes scanned the treeline, searching for any sign of Dystiny. But there was nothing. No movement. No sound. Only the pulse, louder now, vibrating through the ground beneath their feet.

Then, they saw it.

In the center of the clearing, where the object had been half-buried in the earth, there was a disturbance. The ground looked... wrong. Warped, as if something had pushed its way out from underneath. The pulse was deafening here, a constant thrum that made Talon’s head ache.

Sari stepped forward cautiously, her breath coming in shallow gasps. “Talon... what happened?”

He didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the spot where the object had been. It was gone.

The earth had swallowed it—or it had moved. Either way, it wasn’t there anymore. And Dystiny was nowhere to be found.

“Dystiny!” Sari called out, her voice trembling.

No answer. Just the pulse, pounding in Talon’s skull.

“We need to go,” he said, grabbing Sari’s arm. “Now.”

“But what about Dystiny?” Sari’s voice was laced with desperation.

Talon clenched his jaw. “She’s not here. And whatever took her... we’re not equipped to handle it.”

They turned to leave, but before they could take more than a few steps, the air around them shifted. Talon froze, his body tensing as a strange sensation washed over him—a distortion, like the fabric of reality itself had been twisted. Time seemed to stutter, the trees flickering in and out of focus, their edges blurring.

“Talon, what’s happening?” Sari’s voice was barely audible over the pulse, which had become a cacophony of sound, crashing through their minds like a tidal wave.

Talon’s vision swam, and for a moment, he wasn’t sure if he was standing in the woods or somewhere else entirely. The trees flickered again, replaced by ghostly afterimages—shadows of places he didn’t recognize. And then, just as quickly as it had started, the distortion stopped.

The woods returned to normal, the pulse fading back to its familiar rhythm. Talon blinked, trying to steady himself. Sari was beside him, her face pale and drawn, her breath coming in quick gasps.

“Did you... did you see that?” she asked, her voice shaky.

Talon nodded, swallowing hard. “Yeah. I saw it.”

The pulse had done something to the fabric of reality. He didn’t know how or why, but he could feel it. Time had bent, flickered, leaving them disoriented and unsure of what was real.

And Dystiny was still gone.

***

The walk back to town was a blur. Talon’s mind raced, his thoughts tangled with questions he couldn’t answer. Dystiny had vanished—taken by the pulse, or by whatever force was behind it. The object had moved, or disappeared entirely, leaving only chaos in its wake.

When they reached the town square, the air was thick with tension. People were gathered in small clusters, their faces pale, eyes wide with fear. They had felt it too—the distortion, the pulse growing stronger. Whispers of missing time, ghostly images, and lost hours rippled through the crowd like wildfire.

Talon and Sari pushed their way through the throng, heading straight for Father Nathan, who stood at the steps of the church, his brow furrowed in concern.

“You felt it, didn’t you?” Talon asked as they approached.

Father Nathan nodded, his face grim. “I did. The pulse... it’s growing more powerful. People are reporting strange things—lost time, visions of places that don’t exist.”

Sari’s voice wavered. “Dystiny’s gone. We went to the clearing, and she wasn’t there. The object... it’s moved, or disappeared. Something’s happening out there, and it’s getting worse.”

Father Nathan looked down, his hands gripping his rosary tightly. “The Lord is testing us. But we must stay strong. Dystiny... we will find her. We must keep our faith.”

Talon clenched his fists, frustration bubbling inside him. Faith wasn’t enough. Not now. Not when the pulse was tearing reality apart. But he bit back his words, knowing they wouldn’t help. Father Nathan was doing what he could, but they needed more than prayers.

They needed answers.

As the night deepened, the pulse continued, its grip tightening on the town. Talon knew that whatever had taken Dystiny wasn’t finished. This was only the beginning.

And soon, the pulse would demand more.

---

**Chapter 5: Panic in Town**

The town of Brookridge teetered on the edge of madness. By morning, the pulse had permeated every corner of life, twisting the fabric of the once quiet town into something alien and unsettling. Fear hung thick in the air, and it wasn’t just the pulse anymore—it was the growing realization that reality itself was fraying at the edges.

Talon stood in the town square, watching the people gather. They huddled in small groups, voices low but frantic. Whispers of strange visions, lost time, and the feeling of being watched spread like wildfire. There were rumors of more disappearances, though no one could confirm them. No one had seen Dystiny since yesterday, and it was as if she’d vanished without a trace, swallowed by the pulse.

Father Nathan stood on the steps of the church, his voice raised in an attempt to calm the crowd, but it was clear he was losing control. The pulse had shaken even him, and the cracks in his calm exterior were beginning to show.

“Brothers and sisters!” Father Nathan called out, raising his arms as if to embrace the panicked crowd. “We must remain calm! This is a test—a trial that we will overcome together! The Lord is watching over us!”

But the crowd wasn’t listening. The tension was palpable, a barely contained storm of fear and paranoia. Talon could see it in their eyes—the wild, darting looks, the way they clutched each other as if physical contact could anchor them to reality.

“They’re not going to stay calm for much longer,” Sari whispered beside him, her eyes scanning the growing mass of people. She was right. The crowd was swelling, and the pulse throbbed in the air like a silent drumbeat, winding tighter and tighter.

Talon gritted his teeth. “We need to do something. If this gets out of hand...”

Before he could finish, a loud voice rang out from the edge of the square.

“This is all your fault!”

Heads turned as Billy Ray "Bubba" Culpepper stormed into the square, his face twisted in rage. His eyes darted wildly as he waved his arms, addressing the crowd with a growing fervor.

“I told y’all! I told y’all somethin’ was wrong with this town!” Bubba shouted, his voice hoarse from days of ranting to anyone who would listen. “That damn pulse ain’t no act of God—it’s them government folks, messin’ with our heads!”

There were murmurs of agreement from some of the townsfolk, but others looked on in confusion. Bubba’s conspiracy theories had always been a source of tension in town, but now, in the face of the pulse, people were starting to believe him.

“They’re watchin’ us!” Bubba continued, pacing like a wild animal. “They’re experimentin’ on us, seein’ how far they can push us ‘fore we break!”

Talon cursed under his breath. This was exactly what they didn’t need right now—more fuel for the fire. The crowd was already on edge, and Bubba’s ranting was only going to push them further into panic.

“Bubba, calm down,” Talon said, stepping forward. “We don’t know what’s causing the pulse yet. We need to focus on keeping everyone safe.”

Bubba whirled on him, eyes blazing. “Safe? You think we’re safe? They’re pickin’ us off one by one! First that girl—what’s her name? Dystiny. Now more folks are disappearin’. It’s only a matter of time ‘fore we’re all gone!”

The crowd murmured louder now, the fear spreading like a virus. Talon could see it—the cracks forming, the descent into chaos beginning.

“We don’t know that,” Sari said, stepping up beside Talon. “But we need to stay together. If we let fear control us, we’ll lose everything.”

“Fear’s the only thing keepin’ us alive!” Bubba spat. “Y’all can trust in your fancy science or your prayers, but I’m tellin’ ya, this ain’t natural. And we need to do somethin’ ‘bout it.”

The crowd was shifting, uncertainty rippling through them like the pulse itself. Some were starting to listen to Bubba, while others clung to Father Nathan’s assurances. The divisions were forming, and Talon could feel the tension building toward a breaking point.

Before anyone could react, a glass bottle flew through the air and smashed against the church steps, narrowly missing Father Nathan. The crowd gasped as the sound echoed through the square.

Panic erupted.

People surged forward, shouting at each other, fists raised as accusations flew. Some screamed about the government, others about divine punishment. Talon felt the pulse thrum violently beneath his feet, like the earth was on the verge of tearing itself apart.

“We need to get them out of here!” Talon shouted over the noise, grabbing Sari’s arm. “This is going to turn ugly fast!”

Sari nodded, her face pale. Together, they pushed through the crowd, trying to reach Father Nathan before things escalated further. But the pulse was feeding the chaos, amplifying every fear, every doubt, until it was all-consuming.

Talon reached the steps of the church just as a fight broke out between two men in the crowd. One man—Bubba—shoved another to the ground, shouting incoherently about conspiracies. The other man, a younger factory worker, swung back, catching Bubba on the jaw. The two of them tumbled to the ground, fists flying.

“Father!” Sari called out, trying to get Father Nathan’s attention, but he was frozen, his eyes wide with shock as the crowd turned on itself.

Talon shoved his way through the brawling men, grabbing Bubba by the collar and dragging him off the other man. “That’s enough!” he barked, his voice sharp. “You’re not helping anyone!”

Bubba struggled against him, his face red with rage. “We need to fight back! Don’t you see that?”

“This isn’t a fight!” Talon shouted. “It’s a massacre waiting to happen!”

Before he could say more, a scream cut through the air—a sound so piercing and primal that it froze everyone in place.

All eyes turned toward the far end of the square, where a woman stood, her hands clutched to her face. Her eyes were wide with terror, and behind her, the sky had begun to darken. Not like a storm—something far worse.

The pulse grew louder, pounding in Talon’s ears as the shadows stretched across the square, twisting into unnatural shapes. The ground beneath them seemed to warp and shift, as if reality itself was buckling under the weight of the pulse.

“What the hell is that?” someone whispered, their voice trembling.

Talon stared in horror as the shadows writhed, taking on forms that defied explanation. They flickered in and out of existence, like they were caught between this world and another. And the pulse... the pulse was louder than ever, a deafening roar that shook him to his core.

The crowd began to scream, pushing and shoving to escape the square. The shadows reached out, brushing against the edges of the buildings, warping the walls and windows. Talon could see faces in the darkness—distorted, twisted reflections of the people in the square.

“This is it,” Bubba whispered, his eyes wide with terror. “This is the end.”

Talon grabbed Sari’s hand and pulled her toward the church steps. “We have to get inside! Now!”

They ran, shoving through the panicked crowd, as the shadows closed in. The pulse was overwhelming, a constant pounding that seemed to synchronize with his heartbeat, faster and faster until he thought he might collapse from the pressure.

Father Nathan stood frozen at the door of the church, his eyes wide as he stared at the approaching darkness.

“Father!” Talon shouted, shaking him. “We have to move!”

Father Nathan blinked, as if waking from a dream, and nodded numbly. Together, they rushed inside, slamming the door shut behind them just as the first tendrils of shadow reached the steps.

The pulse was deafening now, reverberating through the walls of the church, shaking the stained glass windows as the darkness pressed against the doors.

Talon slumped against the wall, gasping for breath. Outside, the screams of the townspeople echoed through the night, growing fainter with each passing second as the pulse tightened its grip on Brookridge.

And somewhere in the darkness, Dystiny was still missing.

**Chapter 6: The Pulse Reveals Secrets**

The church was eerily silent, save for the low hum of the pulse that had woven itself into the very foundation of the building. Talon sat slumped against the cold stone wall, trying to catch his breath. Sari was beside him, her face pale, her hands trembling as she stared at the heavy wooden doors that now separated them from the chaos outside.

Father Nathan stood at the altar, his back to them, gripping the edge of the pulpit as though he might fall if he let go. His lips moved silently in prayer, but Talon could sense the doubt creeping into the man’s heart. The pulse had shaken everyone, even those whose faith seemed unshakable.

“What do we do now?” Sari asked, her voice barely more than a whisper.

Talon shook his head, staring at the floor. “I don’t know. This thing... it’s not just a sound. It’s affecting us. Warping us.”

“It’s not just warping,” Sari muttered, running a hand through her tangled hair. “It’s... pulling things out of us. I felt it earlier—memories, thoughts, stuff I hadn’t thought about in years. It’s like it’s digging inside of us.”

Talon’s gaze shifted to her. He hadn’t told anyone, but he had felt it too. Ever since he’d touched that object in the woods, his dreams had been plagued by fragments of memories—things he had buried long ago. Things he didn’t want to remember.

Sari continued, her voice trembling, “I keep seeing my parents. They were strict—too strict. I grew up under the weight of their expectations, and now... it’s like I’m back there again, trapped in that house, never good enough. Every time the pulse hits, I feel it, as if it’s pulling me back into those moments.”

Talon reached out, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You’re not alone. It’s doing the same to me. I’ve been seeing... my brother.” He paused, swallowing hard. “He died when we were kids. I’ve tried to forget, but now it’s like the pulse is forcing me to relive it, over and over.”

Sari’s eyes softened with empathy, but there was no time for comfort. A sudden creaking sound echoed through the church, and they both turned to see Father Nathan stumbling away from the altar, his face pale and drawn.

“It’s not just us,” Father Nathan murmured, his voice shaky. “It’s... it’s everyone. The pulse—it’s pulling out our sins, our fears, our guilt. This is a test of faith, yes, but it’s also... a reckoning.”

Talon frowned. “A reckoning?”

Father Nathan nodded, his hands trembling as he held his rosary close to his chest. “I’ve been seeing things, too. Visions of the past. My failures, my weaknesses... they’re all coming back to haunt me. I thought I had left them behind, but the pulse... it’s unearthing them. I think it’s showing us who we truly are.”

“That doesn’t explain why,” Talon said, standing. “Why now? Why is it happening here?”

Before anyone could answer, the door to the church burst open with a loud crash. Talon spun around, his heart racing, half expecting the shadows to pour in. But instead, a figure staggered through the doorway, collapsing onto the cold stone floor.

It was Dystiny.

Sari gasped and rushed to her side, kneeling beside her. Dystiny was pale, her clothes torn and dirty, her eyes wide and unfocused. She was breathing heavily, her body shaking as though she had been running for days.

“Dystiny! Are you okay?” Sari asked, gently shaking her.

Dystiny’s eyes fluttered, and for a moment, it seemed as if she didn’t recognize them. Then, slowly, her gaze focused on Sari, and her lips parted, though no sound came out at first. She looked haunted, like she had seen things no one should ever see.

“Dystiny, where have you been?” Talon asked, crouching beside her. “We thought you were gone.”

“I... I was,” Dystiny rasped, her voice barely audible. “I... don’t know where I went.”

Talon’s stomach churned. “What do you mean?”

Dystiny’s eyes darted to the ceiling, her hands gripping the floor as though she needed to hold on to something solid. “I went back to the clearing... to the object. It was calling me. I couldn’t resist. When I touched it... everything changed.”

Sari’s hand froze. “What do you mean ‘everything changed’?”

Dystiny blinked, and a single tear slid down her cheek. “I wasn’t here anymore. I don’t know where I was, but... it wasn’t here. It was like... another version of this place. But twisted. Dark. The sky was black, the air was thick, and the pulse... it was everywhere.”

Talon exchanged a glance with Sari. “Another version of Brookridge?”

Dystiny nodded weakly. “And I wasn’t alone. I saw... people. People from town. But they were different. Hollow, like they weren’t real. Like they were just... echoes.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his eyes wide with concern. “What you’re describing... it sounds like a vision. But visions aren’t supposed to be this real.”

“It wasn’t just a vision,” Dystiny whispered, her voice breaking. “It was real. I was there for days. I... I lost track of time. And then, just as suddenly as I arrived, I was back. But I’m not the same. I feel... older.”

Talon’s eyes narrowed. “Older?”

Dystiny nodded. “I don’t know how long I was there, but it felt like... years. Decades, maybe. And I saw things. Horrible things. Brookridge was gone, swallowed by the pulse. And the people... they were consumed by it.”

Sari covered her mouth, her eyes wide with horror. “That can’t be...”

“It’s true,” Dystiny insisted, her voice growing stronger. “I don’t know what the pulse is, but it’s not just a sound or an energy. It’s alive. It’s... feeding on us. On our memories, our fears, our sins. It wants more.”

Father Nathan looked pale, his rosary clutched tightly in his hands. “This is... a test of faith. It must be.”

“No,” Dystiny whispered, shaking her head. “It’s not a test. It’s a warning. And if we don’t stop it, the pulse will consume everything. It already has... in that other place.”

Talon stood, his mind racing. “We need to figure out how to stop it. If the pulse is alive, if it’s feeding on us, we have to find a way to cut it off.”

“But how?” Sari asked, her voice trembling. “We don’t even know where it’s coming from.”

Dystiny closed her eyes, her breathing slow and labored. “It’s... in the earth. Deep underground. That’s where it’s strongest.”

Talon’s gaze hardened. “Then that’s where we’ll go.”

Father Nathan shook his head, his voice soft but firm. “No. We cannot face this alone. We need the strength of the Lord.”

Talon clenched his fists. “We need more than faith to stop this.”

The pulse throbbed in the air, louder now, like a living thing breathing just beneath the surface.

The time for decisions was over.

They had to act.

---

**Chapter 7: Reality Fractures**

The air in Brookridge grew colder as the pulse continued to pulse through every inch of the town. It had become more than just a vibration, more than an eerie sound creeping through the earth—it was now a living presence, warping reality itself. Time had begun to slip. People reported losing hours, some even days. Others spoke of seeing shadows that didn’t belong to anyone, ghostly afterimages of people who were no longer there.

Talon, Sari, and Dystiny sat in the church, the heavy silence between them punctuated by the occasional creak of the wooden floorboards, as if the building itself was breathing. Father Nathan stood by the window, staring out at the fractured town, his face tight with worry.

“We need to go underground,” Talon said, breaking the silence. His voice was steady, but inside, he was churning with fear. “Dystiny said that’s where the pulse is strongest. If we want to stop it, we have to find its source.”

Father Nathan turned slowly, his eyes shadowed with doubt. “You don’t understand, Talon. The pulse... it’s not just a physical force. It’s affecting our souls. Our memories. It’s... testing us.”

Talon clenched his fists. “I don’t care what it’s testing. People are disappearing. Reality is breaking apart. If we don’t stop this thing now, there won’t be anything left of Brookridge.”

Sari nodded, her face pale but resolute. “We have to do something. If we stay here, we’re as good as dead.”

Dystiny, still pale and weakened from her return, spoke up from where she sat slumped against the wall. “We don’t have much time. The longer we wait, the more the pulse will take. It’s already started warping time... reality. Soon, we won’t be able to tell what’s real anymore.”

Father Nathan frowned, his eyes flicking between them. “And what if we go down there and find nothing? What if this... pulse is beyond our control? You’ve seen what it does to people. It feeds on their deepest fears, their darkest memories. What if we’re the next victims?”

Talon looked him dead in the eyes. “If we don’t do something, we’re already victims.”

The church door creaked open suddenly, and all heads turned as a man stumbled in—Jack Vine. He looked disheveled, his eyes wild and bloodshot, his clothes rumpled. Jack had always been something of an enigma to the townsfolk, brilliant but manipulative, always playing games in his head that no one else could follow. Now, though, he looked like a man on the edge of a breakdown.

“The pulse,” Jack gasped, clutching the doorway for support. “It’s... it’s worse than you think.”

Talon frowned, stepping forward. “What do you mean?”

Jack’s eyes darted around the room, his fingers twitching. “I’ve been studying it. Trying to figure it out. It’s not just affecting time or memories... it’s breaking reality itself. I’ve seen it. Fractures. Time loops. People trapped in moments that repeat over and over.”

Sari’s breath caught. “Loops?”

Jack nodded, his hands shaking. “I saw it happen. One of the townsfolk, Anna... she was walking down the street, and then... then she wasn’t. She just vanished. And then, a few minutes later, I saw her again—walking down the same street, doing the exact same thing. Like she was stuck in some kind of loop.”

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest. “And what happened to her?”

“She’s still there,” Jack whispered. “Still walking. Over and over. No one can get her out.”

Father Nathan’s face tightened with fear. “This is what I was warning you about. The pulse... it’s beyond us.”

“No,” Talon said, shaking his head. “We can stop this. We have to.”

Jack’s eyes darted to Talon, wild with desperation. “There’s only one way out of a loop like that. You have to break it.”

Sari narrowed her eyes. “Break it? How?”

Jack hesitated, his voice dropping to a whisper. “A sacrifice. The loop won’t reset unless someone... dies.”

The words hung in the air, chilling the room. Talon felt a wave of nausea wash over him. The pulse wasn’t just bending time and reality—it was demanding a price. A price none of them were ready to pay.

Father Nathan’s face paled further. “No. We can’t... we can’t give in to that. There must be another way.”

“There isn’t,” Jack said, his voice trembling. “I’ve seen it. The pulse is alive. It’s feeding on us, on our memories, on our fear. It won’t stop until it’s consumed everything.”

Dystiny stirred, her voice weak but determined. “He’s right. The pulse is... hungry. I felt it when I was trapped in that other version of Brookridge. It’s feeding on us, and it won’t stop until we’re all gone.”

Talon’s mind raced. They had to act, but how could they fight something they couldn’t even understand? He glanced at Sari, who was pale and shaking but still resolute. She had lost her family to this town’s darkness, and now it was coming for them all.

“We go underground,” Talon said finally. “We find the source, and we stop it. If we don’t, none of us will survive this.”

Sari nodded, her face pale but determined. “I’m with you.”

Jack hesitated, fear flashing across his face. “If you go down there... you might not come back.”

Talon met his gaze, unflinching. “If we don’t go, we’re dead anyway.”

Jack swallowed hard, then nodded. “I’ll help. I’ve been... keeping track of the pulse’s movements. I think I know where it’s strongest. I’ll guide you.”

Father Nathan opened his mouth to object, but the look in Talon’s eyes silenced him. “I won’t stop you,” the priest said quietly. “But I’ll be here... praying for you.”

Talon gave him a brief nod, then turned to the others. “We need supplies. If we’re going underground, we’re going to need light, rope... anything we can use to find our way back.”

“I’ll gather what we need,” Sari said, already moving toward the door.

As she and Jack left to gather supplies, Dystiny slowly got to her feet, wincing from the effort. She was still weak from her ordeal, but her eyes were sharper now, filled with a new determination.

“I’m coming with you,” she said softly.

Talon hesitated, his brow furrowing. “You’ve been through enough, Dystiny. You don’t have to—”

“I do,” she interrupted, her voice stronger. “I’ve seen what happens if we don’t stop this. I can’t let that future happen.”

Talon gave her a grim nod. “Then we go together.”

***

As night fell over Brookridge, the group gathered at the edge of the woods, the pulse thrumming louder beneath their feet. Jack stood at the front, his face tight with fear but also grim resolve. He pointed toward a narrow path that wound down into the earth.

“Down there,” he said. “That’s where the pulse is strongest.”

Talon took a deep breath, gripping the rope in his hand. This was it. There was no turning back now. They would descend into the heart of the pulse, and whatever they found down there—whatever price it demanded—they would face it together.

“Let’s go,” he said.

And with that, they descended into the darkness.

---

**Chapter 8: The Underground Discovery**

The descent into the earth was slow and treacherous. The narrow path twisted and turned, the walls pressing in on all sides, as if the earth itself was trying to swallow them whole. The deeper they went, the colder the air became, until it felt like they were walking into the belly of a beast. The pulse was louder here, no longer a faint vibration beneath their feet but a living, breathing thing, thrumming through the stone, echoing off the walls.

Talon led the way, his flashlight cutting through the darkness. Behind him, Sari followed closely, clutching a rope tied to her waist, her face pale but determined. Jack and Dystiny brought up the rear, their eyes darting around as if they expected the walls to close in on them at any moment.

“We’re close,” Jack whispered, his voice barely audible over the steady beat of the pulse. “I can feel it.”

Talon glanced back at him, his jaw tight. He could feel it too—something was drawing them deeper, pulling them toward the heart of the pulse. The air around them was thick with tension, every step heavier than the last. It felt as if time itself was bending, warping around them, making it impossible to know how long they had been walking.

Sari stumbled slightly, catching herself against the wall. “This place... it feels wrong.”

Talon nodded, his eyes scanning the darkness ahead. “We’re not supposed to be here.”

Jack slowed his pace, his hand brushing the stone wall beside him. “It’s ancient. I don’t think anyone has been down here for centuries.”

Dystiny shivered, pulling her coat tighter around her. “Maybe there’s a reason no one’s been down here.”

Talon didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. They all knew that whatever they were walking into, it was far older and far more dangerous than they could imagine.

After what felt like an eternity, the tunnel finally opened up into a vast underground chamber. Talon’s breath caught in his throat as his flashlight illuminated the space. It was massive, the ceiling soaring high above them, the walls carved with strange symbols that seemed to shimmer in the light.

At the center of the chamber stood a large stone structure, half-buried in the ground. It pulsed with energy, the same rhythmic beat that had haunted them for days, only now it was stronger—so strong that Talon could feel it vibrating through his bones.

“This is it,” Jack whispered, stepping forward. His eyes were wide with a mix of awe and fear. “This is the source.”

Talon approached the stone structure cautiously, his flashlight casting long shadows across the floor. The closer he got, the more he could feel the pulse pressing against him, like a physical weight. He reached out, his fingers brushing the surface of the stone. It was cold, but it thrummed with life, like a heartbeat.

“It’s alive,” Sari whispered, her eyes wide as she took in the strange carvings on the walls. “This whole place... it’s part of something bigger.”

Talon stepped back, his heart pounding. “We need to figure out what this is—what it’s doing to the town.”

Dystiny approached the stone, her hands trembling. “It’s not just doing something to the town. It’s doing something to us. I can feel it... pulling at me.”

Jack moved closer to the stone, his hand tracing the symbols carved into its surface. “These symbols... they’re ancient. I don’t recognize the language, but it’s like they’re... alive.”

Talon’s stomach churned as he looked around the chamber. The walls seemed to shimmer, as if they were shifting, warping in and out of focus. The pulse was getting stronger, its rhythm pounding in his ears.

“What do we do?” Sari asked, her voice trembling.

“We destroy it,” Talon said, his voice steady despite the fear clawing at his chest. “We can’t let this thing keep feeding on us.”

Jack shook his head, his eyes wide. “You can’t destroy it. This isn’t just a piece of rock. It’s part of something much larger—something we can’t even begin to understand.”

Talon turned to him, his fists clenched. “If we don’t destroy it, it’s going to destroy us. You’ve seen what it’s doing to the town.”

Before Jack could respond, the pulse surged, sending a shockwave through the chamber. Talon staggered, nearly losing his balance as the ground trembled beneath his feet. The walls shimmered violently, and for a brief moment, the chamber flickered—reality bending and warping around them.

When the world snapped back into focus, Talon’s breath caught in his throat. The chamber hadn’t changed, but something was different—something was watching them. He could feel it, a presence lurking just beyond the edge of his perception, waiting.

“We’re not alone,” Dystiny whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon scanned the darkness, his flashlight shaking in his hand. “What is it?”

“I don’t know,” Dystiny said, her eyes wide with fear. “But it’s... watching us.”

The pulse throbbed again, and Talon felt a cold sweat break out across his skin. The air around them seemed to ripple, and suddenly, shadows began to move along the walls, twisting and writhing like living things.

Sari gasped, stumbling back. “What is that?”

Talon’s heart raced as the shadows coalesced into vague shapes—figures that flickered in and out of existence, like ghosts caught between worlds. They weren’t human. They weren’t even alive, but they were watching, their eyes fixed on the group with a cold, hungry gaze.

“We need to get out of here,” Talon said, his voice tight. “Now.”

Jack shook his head, his eyes glued to the stone structure. “No... we’re too close. We need to understand what this is—”

Another shockwave hit, stronger this time. The ground cracked beneath their feet, and the pulse roared through the chamber, deafening. The shadows surged forward, their forms twisting and flickering, and for the briefest moment, Talon saw faces—faces twisted with agony, their mouths open in silent screams.

Sari screamed, grabbing Talon’s arm. “We have to go!”

But Talon couldn’t move. The pulse was too strong, pulling at him, dragging him toward the stone. It was like gravity, drawing him in, whispering to him, promising him answers if only he would let go.

“Talon!” Sari’s voice cut through the fog in his mind, and he blinked, shaking off the haze.

“Go!” Talon shouted, wrenching himself away from the stone. “Get out of here!”

They ran, the pulse pounding in their ears, the shadows chasing them, growing stronger with each step. The walls of the chamber warped and twisted, reality buckling under the weight of the pulse.

The tunnel loomed ahead, and they scrambled toward it, their breaths coming in ragged gasps. As they reached the entrance, Talon risked a glance back.

The shadows had stopped at the edge of the chamber, writhing and flickering, unable to follow. But the pulse... the pulse was growing louder, angrier, as if it had been denied something it desperately wanted.

They stumbled out of the tunnel, collapsing onto the ground, gasping for breath. The night air was cold and sharp, a stark contrast to the suffocating atmosphere underground.

Talon sat up, his heart pounding in his chest. They had found the source of the pulse—but they hadn’t destroyed it. And now it knew they were there.

“It’s only going to get worse,” Jack said, his voice hoarse. “It’s waking up.”

Talon clenched his fists, his jaw tight. “Then we need to figure out how to stop it—for good.”

Dystiny, still trembling from the ordeal, nodded. “Before it destroys us all.”

The pulse throbbed beneath them, a reminder that time was running out. Brookridge was on the edge of oblivion, and if they didn’t stop the pulse soon, it would consume everything.

---

**Chapter 9: Temporal Loops**

The night sky above Brookridge looked disturbingly normal compared to the chaos festering beneath the town. But inside, Talon could feel the pulse thrumming louder than ever, like a heartbeat that belonged to something much larger than they could comprehend. His legs still trembled from their narrow escape from the underground chamber. It felt like they had barely made it out before the pulse could swallow them whole.

“We need a plan,” Sari said, her voice shaking. She was pacing back and forth, hands running nervously through her hair. “We need to do something before it’s too late.”

“It might already be too late,” Dystiny muttered, her eyes distant. She still hadn’t fully recovered from whatever horrors she’d seen in that other version of Brookridge. “The pulse is growing. It’s warping everything around it.”

Talon clenched his fists, his mind racing. Jack sat hunched nearby, staring at the ground, his face pale and drawn. His brilliant mind, usually sharp and focused, seemed shattered by what they’d found underground.

“We can’t just sit here,” Talon said, more to himself than anyone else. “We have to stop it.”

Jack’s head snapped up. “Stop it? You don’t even understand what it is, let alone how to stop it.” His voice was laced with a barely contained hysteria. “This thing... it’s beyond us. It’s bending reality, Talon. Time itself is... breaking.”

“What do you mean?” Sari asked, her voice tinged with dread.

Jack’s eyes darted between them, wild with fear. “I’ve been seeing it. Fractures. Loops. Time is... stuck. I walked past Anna again today—she was still in the same loop, doing the same thing, over and over. But now it’s spreading. I saw another person today, just walking in circles like they were caught in some invisible trap. The pulse... it’s not just pulling us apart. It’s trapping us.”

Talon’s stomach twisted. “How do we stop it?”

Jack shook his head, laughing bitterly. “Stop it? You don’t. The pulse wants something—sacrifices. If you want to break a loop, someone has to... give something up. Something big.”

Dystiny swallowed hard. “A sacrifice.”

Talon felt the weight of those words settle on him like a heavy cloak. The pulse demanded more than just fear and memories—it was hungry for something deeper. Something personal.

“What if we don’t?” Sari asked softly, her voice barely audible.

Jack’s gaze darkened. “Then we’re stuck. The pulse will keep growing, keep twisting things until we’re all trapped in its loops. There’s no escaping it.”

A heavy silence fell over them, the reality of their situation sinking in. Talon’s mind raced. The town was already fractured—people were losing hours, days. Others were vanishing entirely, swallowed by the pulse or trapped in some nightmarish version of their lives.

And now, the pulse was demanding sacrifices.

“We have to find a way to stop it without...” Talon couldn’t finish the sentence. The thought of losing more people, of losing someone close to him, gnawed at his insides.

Suddenly, a sharp gust of wind tore through the night, and with it came a chilling sound—laughter. It echoed down the street, warped and distorted by the pulse. Talon froze, his heart pounding in his chest.

“Did you hear that?” Sari whispered, her voice barely more than a breath.

They all turned, their eyes scanning the darkness. The wind carried the sound again, this time louder, clearer. It was unmistakable—a child’s laughter.

Talon’s blood ran cold. “Amelia.”

The others didn’t need to ask who he meant. Amelia Thornton, the twelve-year-old girl who had disappeared just days before. The pulse had taken her. Talon had been sure of it.

Without a word, they moved as one, following the sound down the deserted streets of Brookridge. The pulse grew louder with every step, pounding through the ground beneath their feet. Talon’s mind raced, dread gnawing at him as they drew closer to the source of the eerie laughter.

They found her standing at the edge of town, near the old playground. Amelia stood in the soft glow of a flickering streetlight, her back to them, her small figure swaying gently as if she were in a trance.

“Amelia,” Sari called out, her voice soft but urgent.

The girl didn’t respond. She continued to sway, her head tilted upward, as if listening to something only she could hear.

Talon stepped forward cautiously. “Amelia?”

The girl turned slowly, her face illuminated by the dim light. Her eyes were wide and vacant, her expression blank. It was as if she wasn’t really there, a hollow shell of the bright, curious girl they had once known.

“She’s stuck,” Jack whispered, his voice trembling. “The pulse has her.”

Talon’s heart ached as he stepped closer to Amelia. Her small hands were clutching something—a piece of paper, crumpled and worn. He reached out gently, trying not to startle her.

“Amelia,” he whispered, “we’re going to help you.”

As his fingers brushed her hand, the pulse surged violently, and the world around them flickered—once, twice—before snapping back into focus. But something was wrong.

Talon blinked, disoriented. The streetlight flickered again, casting long shadows across the playground. But Amelia was gone. Sari, Dystiny, and Jack stood frozen, their eyes wide with confusion.

“What just happened?” Sari asked, her voice shaking.

“We lost time,” Jack muttered, his hands trembling. “The pulse... it’s looping us. We’re caught in a loop.”

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest as he realized Jack was right. They hadn’t moved, but the world around them had shifted subtly. The pulse had pulled them into a loop—a trap. Amelia was gone, lost somewhere in the web of time the pulse had woven around them.

“We have to get out of here,” Talon said, his voice urgent. “Now.”

They turned to leave, but as they took their first steps, the ground beneath them rippled, and the pulse surged again. The world flickered once more, and Talon found himself back where they had started—standing in front of the playground, with Amelia swaying in the distance.

“No,” Dystiny whispered, horror creeping into her voice. “We’re stuck.”

Talon’s mind raced. They were caught in the loop now, just like the others—trapped in a moment that repeated itself endlessly, with no way out. He could feel the pulse tugging at him, pulling him deeper into its web, demanding a price for their escape.

“A sacrifice,” Jack said softly, his voice barely audible.

Talon clenched his fists, his heart pounding in his chest. He wasn’t going to let the pulse take them. There had to be another way.

“There has to be something we’re missing,” Sari said, her eyes scanning the playground. “Something that breaks the loop.”

The pulse hummed around them, its rhythm steady and insistent. Time was slipping away. Talon could feel it, like sand through his fingers.

“What do we do?” Dystiny asked, her voice filled with despair.

Talon’s mind raced. He thought of Dystiny’s experience in the alternate Brookridge, of the strange visions the pulse had shown them. The pulse fed on their fear, their memories, their guilt. It wanted something more—something personal.

But what?

His eyes locked on the crumpled paper Amelia had been holding. Maybe it wasn’t the pulse itself that held the key, but the memories it pulled from them. Whatever Amelia had been clutching—whatever it meant to her—could be the clue they needed to break free.

Talon stepped forward, reaching out toward the girl again, bracing himself as the pulse surged. This time, he didn’t flinch as the world flickered around him. He grabbed the paper from Amelia’s hand, pulling it free.

The world rippled, the pulse growing louder, and for a brief moment, everything stopped.

They were out of the loop.

Amelia’s figure disappeared, fading into the shadows as the pulse retreated. The world around them snapped back into place, the air heavy and thick with tension. Talon’s breath caught in his throat as he unfolded the crumpled paper.

It was a drawing—Amelia’s drawing of a map. But it wasn’t a map of Brookridge. It was a map of the underground chamber.

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest as he realized what it meant.

“We have to go back,” he said, his voice low and steady. “There’s something down there—something we missed.”

Sari looked at him, her eyes wide with fear. “What are you saying?”

Talon met her gaze, his voice resolute. “The pulse is showing us the way. It’s pulling us back underground. That’s where we’ll find the answer.”

The pulse thrummed softly beneath them, a constant reminder that their time was running out.

And they would have to face whatever waited for them in the darkness.

---

**Chapter 10: The Pulse’s Growth**

The pulse had spread beyond Brookridge. By morning, strange phenomena were being reported in the surrounding towns—animals behaving erratically, objects moving on their own, and people experiencing vivid hallucinations. Talon knew time was running out. Whatever force they had awakened beneath the earth was growing stronger, its influence seeping out of the town like a dark cloud, corrupting everything in its path.

They stood at the edge of the woods, the early morning mist hanging low over the ground. Sari clutched Amelia’s crumpled map in her hands, her eyes scanning the simple lines and symbols drawn with a child’s hand. The map seemed to lead deeper into the underground chamber, to a place they hadn’t yet explored. A place where answers might be waiting.

“We have to go back,” Talon said, his voice resolute. He stared at the entrance to the underground tunnel, the weight of the decision heavy in his chest. Every instinct told him to run, to get as far away from the pulse as possible. But running wasn’t an option. The pulse was spreading, and if they didn’t stop it now, it would consume everything.

Sari nodded, her face pale but determined. “We know what we’re dealing with now. We have to stop it.”

Jack stood a few steps away, his hands trembling as he clutched his flashlight. His face was gaunt, his eyes sunken with exhaustion. The pulse had taken its toll on him, warping his brilliant mind into a tangled mess of fear and confusion. But even in his broken state, there was still a flicker of determination in his eyes.

“I’ve been thinking,” Jack said quietly, his voice shaky. “The pulse isn’t just alive—it’s sentient. It’s learning, growing. Every time we interact with it, it changes. And now it’s growing beyond the town. We need to figure out what it wants, or we won’t be able to stop it.”

Dystiny, who had been silent for most of the morning, finally spoke up. “What if we’re too late? What if it’s already spread too far?”

Talon clenched his fists. “We can’t think like that. We’ve seen what the pulse can do—it warps reality, traps people in loops, feeds on fear and memories. But it hasn’t won yet. There’s still time.”

Father Nathan had insisted on joining them, despite his earlier reservations. He stood beside Sari, his face drawn and weary, but his eyes were filled with a grim determination. “Faith is what will guide us through this,” he said softly. “Even in the face of this darkness, we must hold onto hope.”

Talon didn’t know if faith would be enough, but he appreciated the priest’s resolve. They needed every ounce of strength they could muster. The pulse was growing stronger by the hour, and they were running out of options.

“Let’s go,” Talon said, leading the way into the tunnel.

***

The descent into the underground chamber felt different this time. The pulse was louder, its rhythm more erratic, like the beating of a heart pushed to the brink of collapse. The walls seemed to shimmer with energy, the strange symbols carved into the stone glowing faintly in the dim light of their flashlights.

Sari walked beside Talon, holding the map tightly in her hand. “The map leads deeper,” she said quietly. “There’s a section we missed, a part of the chamber we didn’t explore.”

“Do you think that’s where the core of the pulse is?” Talon asked, his voice low.

“I don’t know,” Sari admitted. “But it feels right. Like we’re being guided there.”

The group moved cautiously through the chamber, their footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. The pulse thrummed beneath them, vibrating through the stone, making the air around them feel thick and heavy. Talon could feel the weight of it pressing down on him, like a storm about to break.

As they ventured deeper into the chamber, the walls seemed to pulse with light, the symbols glowing brighter with each step they took. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, the pulse matching the rhythm of his own heartbeat. He could feel it now—an insistent tug, pulling him toward something. Toward the source.

“There,” Jack whispered, pointing ahead.

In the center of the chamber, half-buried in the ground, was a massive stone structure. It was different from the one they had seen before. Larger, more intricate. The symbols carved into its surface seemed to writhe and twist, alive with energy.

The pulse was stronger here, almost deafening. Talon could feel it vibrating through his bones, making his skin prickle with static.

“We’ve found it,” Sari breathed, her eyes wide with awe and fear.

“This is the core,” Jack said, his voice trembling. “This is where the pulse is coming from.”

Talon stepped forward cautiously, his eyes locked on the stone structure. It thrummed with power, the pulse radiating from it like a living thing. He could feel it pulling at him, whispering in the back of his mind, promising him answers—if only he would give in.

“What do we do?” Dystiny asked, her voice barely audible.

“We stop it,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We destroy it.”

“How?” Sari asked, her eyes wide. “We don’t even know what it is.”

Before Talon could answer, the pulse surged, and the ground beneath their feet trembled violently. The walls of the chamber warped and twisted, and the air around them seemed to crackle with electricity. Talon staggered, catching himself against the stone wall.

“What’s happening?” Dystiny cried, panic rising in her voice.

“The pulse,” Jack gasped. “It’s fighting back.”

The ground shook again, harder this time, and cracks began to form in the stone beneath their feet. Talon’s heart raced as the pulse throbbed louder, its rhythm erratic and wild. It was like the pulse was alive, struggling against them, trying to protect itself.

“We have to destroy it now,” Talon shouted, his voice barely audible over the deafening roar of the pulse. “If we don’t, it’s going to consume everything!”

“But how?” Sari cried, her eyes filled with fear.

Talon stared at the stone structure, his mind racing. There had to be a way. The pulse was alive, sentient, but it was vulnerable. It fed on fear, on memories, on their darkest thoughts. But it was also bound to this place—this core.

Then it hit him.

“The pulse is tied to us,” Talon said, his voice steady despite the chaos around them. “It’s feeding on us—on our memories, our fears, our guilt. That’s how it’s growing stronger.”

“We’ve seen it,” Jack added, his voice trembling. “It warps reality, traps people in loops, makes them relive their worst moments. It’s using our minds against us.”

Talon took a deep breath. “Then we need to starve it. We need to take away its power.”

Father Nathan frowned, his hand tightening around his rosary. “And how do we do that?”

“We cut ourselves off,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We have to confront the things it’s feeding on—the fears, the memories, the guilt. We have to face them and let them go.”

Sari’s eyes widened. “You mean... we have to make peace with it?”

Talon nodded. “If we don’t, the pulse will keep feeding on us, and it’ll keep growing stronger. But if we can cut off its food source, we can weaken it. Maybe even destroy it.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his face resolute. “Then let us begin.”

The pulse throbbed louder, its rhythm chaotic and wild, but Talon felt a strange calm settle over him. He knew what they had to do now. They had to face the darkness within themselves, confront the memories and fears the pulse had twisted and used against them.

One by one, they gathered around the stone structure, closing their eyes as the pulse washed over them. The air crackled with energy, and the chamber seemed to warp around them, but they stood firm, bracing themselves for what was to come.

The pulse was about to reveal their darkest truths.

And if they didn’t confront them, the pulse would consume them all.

---

**Chapter 11: Divisions and Betrayal**

The pulse surged violently, and the chamber seemed to pulse along with it, flickering like the heartbeat of some ancient, malevolent creature. Talon, Sari, Dystiny, Jack, and Father Nathan stood in a circle around the stone structure, the air thick with tension. Each of them knew what was coming—the pulse was about to drag out their deepest fears, their darkest memories.

Talon clenched his fists as the pulse throbbed in his chest, like a second heart beating out of sync with his own. The air around them crackled with energy, and the ground trembled beneath their feet. The pulse wasn’t just alive—it was angry. It had sensed their intention to destroy it, and it was lashing out in desperation.

“We need to stay focused,” Talon said, his voice steady but strained. “Whatever it shows us, we can’t let it control us. We have to face it.”

Sari nodded, though her face was pale and her hands shook. “We can do this.”

Jack, who had been pacing nervously, finally stopped and turned toward the group. His eyes were wide, and there was something wild in his expression. “You’re wrong,” he said, his voice barely more than a whisper.

Talon frowned, stepping toward him. “What are you talking about?”

Jack’s hands trembled as he pointed at the stone structure, the pulse thrumming violently beneath them. “We can’t stop it. Don’t you see? The pulse is beyond us. It’s not something we can destroy—it’s something we have to control.”

Sari’s eyes widened in shock. “Control? Jack, we can’t—”

“We can!” Jack interrupted, his voice growing more frantic. “The pulse isn’t evil. It’s power. Raw, unbridled power, and it’s growing because we’re feeding it. We’ve already unlocked part of its potential. If we could learn to harness it, we could reshape reality itself!”

Talon’s stomach twisted as he realized what Jack was saying. The pulse wasn’t just warping reality—it was offering something to those who sought to control it. Jack had been seduced by the pulse’s promise of power, and now he was willing to betray them to get it.

“Jack, you don’t know what you’re saying,” Talon said, his voice firm. “The pulse isn’t offering power—it’s using us. It’s feeding on us, and it won’t stop until it consumes everything.”

Jack shook his head, a crazed grin spreading across his face. “You’re wrong, Talon. I’ve seen what it can do. I’ve seen the future—the pulse will reshape the world, and we can be the ones to control it. We can be the ones to wield that power.”

Sari took a step back, her face pale. “Jack, please. You’re not thinking clearly. The pulse is manipulating you.”

“No,” Jack snarled, his eyes flashing with anger. “It’s you who doesn’t understand. You’re too afraid to embrace what the pulse is offering. But I’m not. I’m not afraid of it.”

Talon’s heart pounded as the pulse surged again, sending another shockwave through the chamber. The air grew thick with tension, and the walls began to shimmer, as if reality itself was buckling under the weight of the pulse’s power.

“Jack, listen to me,” Talon said, his voice tight. “This isn’t about power. This is about survival. If we don’t stop the pulse now, it’s going to consume everything—us, the town, the world.”

Jack laughed bitterly, his face twisted with rage. “You’re a fool, Talon. You’re too blinded by fear to see the truth. The pulse doesn’t need to be stopped—it needs to be controlled. And if you’re too weak to do it, then I’ll do it myself.”

Before anyone could react, Jack turned and sprinted toward the stone structure, his hands outstretched. The pulse roared in response, the air around the structure warping violently as Jack reached for it.

“Jack, no!” Sari screamed, but it was too late.

The moment Jack’s hands touched the stone, a blinding flash of light exploded from the structure, sending Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan tumbling backward. The pulse surged, the rhythm of its beat growing faster, more chaotic, as Jack’s body convulsed, caught in the grip of its power.

For a moment, everything was still. The light dimmed, and Jack stood frozen, his hands still pressed against the stone. His eyes were wide, his mouth open in a silent scream. The pulse throbbed violently beneath him, its energy coursing through his veins, warping him from the inside out.

Then, with a sudden, sickening crack, Jack’s body collapsed, his limbs twisting unnaturally as the pulse consumed him. Talon watched in horror as Jack’s form was swallowed by the light, his body dissolving into the energy of the pulse.

And then he was gone.

The pulse quieted, its rhythm slowing as the light faded from the chamber. The air was heavy with the scent of burning, and the ground beneath them trembled, as if the pulse was struggling to contain the power it had just absorbed.

Talon staggered to his feet, his heart pounding in his chest. “Jack...”

Sari stood beside him, her face pale with shock. “He’s gone.”

Dystiny was on her knees, staring at the spot where Jack had stood, her hands trembling. “I told you... it’s hungry. It wants more.”

Father Nathan crossed himself, his eyes wide with horror. “The pulse... it’s a force beyond our comprehension. Jack was a fool to think he could control it.”

Talon’s fists clenched as he stared at the stone structure, now pulsing more steadily, almost content. Jack had tried to harness the pulse’s power, and it had destroyed him. But the pulse was still growing, still feeding, and they were no closer to stopping it.

“We have to destroy it,” Talon said, his voice filled with a renewed sense of urgency. “If we don’t, it’s going to keep feeding on us until there’s nothing left.”

“But how?” Sari asked, her voice trembling. “We tried to confront it, and it took Jack. How do we fight something like this?”

Talon’s mind raced. Jack had been wrong about controlling the pulse, but he had been right about one thing—it was tied to their memories, their emotions, their darkest thoughts. It was feeding on them because they were connected to it, and as long as they remained connected, the pulse would continue to grow.

“We need to break the connection,” Talon said, his voice steady. “We need to let go of whatever the pulse is feeding on—our guilt, our fear, our memories. If we cut ourselves off from it, we can weaken it.”

Father Nathan frowned. “But how do we do that? How do we let go of the things that have defined us for so long?”

Talon shook his head. “I don’t know. But we have to try. If we don’t, the pulse will keep growing, and it’ll take all of us, just like it took Jack.”

Sari’s eyes filled with tears, but she nodded. “We can do this. We have to.”

Dystiny stood, her face pale but resolute. “I’ve seen what happens if we don’t. I’ve seen the future the pulse wants. We can’t let that happen.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his face grim but determined. “Then we do this together. We face our fears, our sins, and we let them go. We trust in each other—and in the strength of our own hearts.”

Talon nodded, the pulse still thrumming beneath his feet, but quieter now, as if waiting. “Let’s end this.”

The group gathered around the stone structure once more, their hands trembling but their resolve unshaken. The pulse hummed softly, almost content with the energy it had absorbed from Jack’s sacrifice. But Talon knew it wasn’t satisfied—not yet.

They had to face their darkness, confront the things the pulse had twisted and used against them.

And only then, when they had let go of their deepest fears, could they destroy the pulse.

The final battle was about to begin.

---

**Chapter 12: Confronting the Darkness**

The pulse throbbed beneath their feet, a steady rhythm like the ticking of a clock counting down to some inevitable catastrophe. Talon stood in the center of the chamber, his heart racing as the pulse reverberated through his body. Around him, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan were tense, each of them bracing for what was to come.

They had seen what the pulse could do—how it could twist reality, trap people in loops, and consume those who sought to control it. Jack’s body had been devoured by the pulse, his mind broken by the temptation of power. Now, Talon and the others were all that stood between the pulse and the destruction of everything they held dear.

“We have to cut ourselves off,” Talon said, his voice echoing in the vast chamber. “It’s feeding on us—on our emotions, our fears, our memories. If we face them and let them go, we can break the connection.”

“But how do we even begin?” Sari asked, her voice trembling. Her hands were clasped tightly around the crumpled map, the one Amelia had drawn, as if it could still offer some sort of protection.

Talon’s eyes met hers, and he saw the fear there—the fear that they might not survive this. But he couldn’t let that fear control him. Not anymore.

“We start by facing what the pulse has been using against us,” Talon said, his voice steady. “We face the memories it’s been warping, the guilt it’s been feeding on. We have to make peace with it, or it will consume us.”

Dystiny nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the stone structure that hummed with a malevolent energy at the heart of the chamber. She had seen what the pulse could do—how it had trapped her in that twisted version of Brookridge, how it had shown her a world where everything was lost.

“I’m ready,” she said softly. “Whatever the pulse shows me, I’ll face it.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his face pale but resolute. “We’ll face it together.”

The group stood in a circle around the stone structure, the pulse humming in the air like a distant storm. Talon closed his eyes, taking a deep breath as he prepared himself for what was to come.

And then, the pulse surged.

***

The world around them warped, twisting like a reflection in water. The air grew thick, heavy, and Talon’s breath caught in his throat. For a moment, he was suspended in a void, the pulse reverberating through his mind, pulling at his memories, his fears.

And then the visions came.

He was standing in the woods, but it wasn’t the woods he had known. The trees were dark, gnarled, their branches reaching out like twisted claws. The air was thick with the smell of decay, and the sky was an angry shade of crimson.

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest as he saw the figure standing at the edge of the clearing—a boy, no more than twelve years old, with wide, terrified eyes. His younger brother.

No. *Not this.*

The pulse had dragged this memory from the deepest part of his mind, a memory he had spent years trying to bury. His brother had died in these woods, lost to the wilderness they had once explored together. It had been Talon’s fault. He had been the older brother. He had been the one who should have kept him safe.

“Tyler,” Talon whispered, his voice breaking.

The boy didn’t move. He just stared at Talon, his eyes wide and filled with fear. The pulse surged again, the air around them warping as the memory twisted, pulling Talon deeper into the guilt he had carried for so long.

“It wasn’t your fault, Talon,” a voice whispered, but it wasn’t the voice of the pulse. It was his own voice, from deep inside him—the voice he had silenced for so long.

Talon took a step forward, his heart pounding. “I should have been there for you, Tyler. I should have saved you.”

The boy’s eyes flickered with something—recognition, perhaps. Understanding.

“You couldn’t have known,” the voice inside him whispered. “You were just a kid. You’ve been punishing yourself for something you couldn’t control.”

Talon’s breath caught in his throat, and for the first time in years, he allowed himself to believe it. The pulse had fed on his guilt, twisted it, warped it into something all-consuming. But it wasn’t the truth. The truth was that he had done everything he could, that he couldn’t have saved Tyler, no matter how much he had wanted to.

And in that moment, Talon felt the pulse’s grip on him weaken.

The vision faded, the trees dissolving into mist, and Talon found himself back in the underground chamber, the pulse still humming, but quieter now. The weight on his chest had lifted, and for the first time, he felt free.

He opened his eyes and saw Sari standing across from him, her face pale, her eyes wide with fear as she faced her own vision. Tears streamed down her face as she clutched the crumpled map in her hands.

“I couldn’t save them,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “I couldn’t save my family.”

Talon stepped toward her, his voice gentle. “It wasn’t your fault, Sari.”

Sari’s breath came in ragged gasps as she faced the memory the pulse had dragged out of her—the memory of her family’s death. She had been a child, powerless to stop the illness that had swept through their home, taking them one by one.

“I should have been stronger,” she sobbed. “I should have been able to do something.”

Talon reached out, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You were just a child. You couldn’t have stopped it.”

Sari shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. “I... I tried so hard. I prayed, I begged, but it didn’t matter. They’re gone.”

“But you’re still here,” Talon said softly. “And they wouldn’t want you to carry this burden anymore.”

Sari’s breath hitched, and for a moment, she stood frozen, the weight of her guilt pressing down on her. But then, slowly, she nodded, her grip on the map loosening.

“I have to let them go,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I have to let go of the guilt.”

And as the words left her lips, the pulse weakened again, its grip on her loosening. The vision dissolved, and Sari slumped forward, her breath coming in ragged sobs, but the weight on her chest had lifted.

Father Nathan stood beside her, his eyes closed as he murmured a prayer, his own voice steady despite the weight of the memories the pulse had shown him. He had faced his own demons, his own failures, and had emerged with his faith intact.

Dystiny, too, had faced her fears—the twisted future the pulse had shown her, the version of Brookridge that had been consumed by darkness. She had seen the world destroyed, and for so long, she had believed there was nothing she could do to stop it.

But now, standing in the chamber, surrounded by the people she had fought beside, she knew that wasn’t true.

“I won’t let the pulse take everything,” she said softly, her voice filled with quiet determination. “We’re going to stop it.”

Talon looked around at his companions, each of them battered but standing strong. The pulse was still there, still thrumming beneath their feet, but it was weaker now, its grip on them loosened by their resolve.

“We’re ready,” Talon said, his voice steady. “Let’s end this.”

The pulse surged one final time, but it was no longer in control. Talon and the others stood tall, their fears, their guilt, their darkest memories no longer feeding the pulse.

And with a final surge of energy, the stone structure at the heart of the chamber cracked, the pulse’s energy dissipating into the air, vanishing like mist in the wind.

The chamber was silent.

It was over.

---

**Chapter 13: Echoes of the Pulse**

The silence that followed the pulse’s dissipation was eerie. For a moment, Talon stood frozen, his breath shallow, waiting for the pulse to return, to thrum beneath his skin once more. But it didn’t. The steady, oppressive beat was gone, replaced by a strange stillness that filled the cavernous chamber.

Sari wiped her tear-streaked face, her shoulders sagging in relief. Dystiny leaned against the stone wall, her eyes closed as if she were savoring the quiet. Father Nathan stood at the center of the room, his rosary hanging loosely from his hand, his lips still moving in silent prayer.

“We did it,” Sari whispered, her voice trembling. “We stopped it.”

Talon stepped toward the stone structure, its surface now cracked and lifeless. He ran his hand across the smooth stone, feeling the absence of the pulse that had once thrummed through it. “It’s over,” he said softly, almost to himself.

But something in the back of his mind nagged at him. The pulse may have been silenced, but the world above—the people of Brookridge—had been touched by its presence. They had all been changed by it, warped in ways they couldn’t yet understand.

“What now?” Dystiny asked, her voice tired but steady.

Talon glanced around the chamber, his eyes lingering on the faint glow of the symbols etched into the walls. Even though the pulse was gone, the chamber still felt... alive. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they had only scratched the surface of what the pulse had been.

“We go back to town,” Talon said after a moment. “Make sure everyone’s okay. But we need to be careful. The pulse affected all of us in different ways—it might not be completely gone from their minds.”

Father Nathan nodded gravely. “It was a spiritual test for all of us. The remnants of that test may linger.”

Dystiny looked uneasy but resolute. “We have to see what’s left of the town. It’s not just us who were trapped by the pulse.”

They began their climb back through the tunnel, their footsteps echoing in the eerie quiet. The journey felt different now—lighter, somehow, without the oppressive weight of the pulse pressing down on them. Talon led the way, his mind racing with thoughts of what they might find in Brookridge. 

When they finally emerged from the tunnel and into the daylight, the town of Brookridge lay before them, bathed in a pale, unnatural light. The sky above was cloudy, casting a soft gray shadow over the town. At first glance, everything looked... normal.

But Talon knew better.

As they walked through the streets, they saw signs of the pulse’s lingering influence. People stood in small groups, whispering to each other, their faces tight with fear and confusion. Some stared blankly into the distance, their eyes glazed as if they were still caught in some loop, some distant memory the pulse had twisted inside their minds.

Sari stopped in front of the diner, her brow furrowed. “Do you think... do you think they even know it’s over?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, his voice low. “The pulse affected all of us differently. Some of them might not even realize they were trapped.”

They walked toward the town square, where a crowd had begun to gather. Father Nathan stepped forward, his voice rising above the murmurs. “My friends, we’ve been through a terrible trial, but it’s over now. The pulse has been silenced. We are free.”

The crowd turned to face him, but there was no cheering, no relief. The townspeople’s faces were grim, their eyes filled with uncertainty. It was as if the pulse had left something behind, a residue of its presence that still lingered in their minds.

“We saw things,” one woman said softly, her voice trembling. “Things that weren’t real... but they felt real.”

A man nodded, his hands shaking. “I lost time... I don’t know how long I’ve been stuck here. The same day, over and over.”

Talon exchanged a glance with Sari. The pulse had twisted the town, trapped its people in loops, forced them to relive their worst memories. Even though the source had been destroyed, the scars would remain.

“We’re going to help,” Talon said, stepping forward. “We’ve all been affected by the pulse, but we can recover. We can move forward.”

Dystiny crossed her arms, her eyes scanning the crowd. “It’s not going to be easy. Some of the damage... it’s in our heads. But we have to try.”

Father Nathan nodded, his voice calm and reassuring. “We will heal, in time. We will come together, as a community, and rebuild what was lost. The pulse tested us, but we’re still here. We’re still standing.”

The crowd murmured in agreement, though the fear in their eyes remained. Talon knew it would take time for the town to recover, for the people to trust that the pulse was truly gone. But for now, they had survived.

As the crowd began to disperse, Sari touched Talon’s arm. “Do you think it’s really over?”

Talon glanced back at the town, his eyes lingering on the distant horizon. The pulse was gone, but its echoes would be felt for a long time. “I think it’s over,” he said quietly. “But we’ll have to be vigilant. We don’t know what else the pulse might have left behind.”

Dystiny, who had been quiet, spoke up. “And what about us? We were at the center of it. The pulse fed on us—on our fears, our guilt. Are we ever going to be the same?”

Talon’s heart tightened. He wasn’t sure how to answer that. The pulse had taken something from each of them, twisted their memories, forced them to confront parts of themselves they had long buried. He wasn’t sure if they could ever be the same after that.

“No,” Talon said finally, his voice low. “I don’t think we’ll ever be the same. But maybe that’s not a bad thing. We faced the worst parts of ourselves... and we survived.”

Father Nathan placed a hand on Talon’s shoulder, his eyes filled with quiet strength. “What matters now is how we move forward. We’ve been given a second chance.”

Talon nodded, though the weight of what they had been through still pressed on him. The pulse was gone, but its presence would linger in their minds, a reminder of the darkness they had faced—and the choices they had made.

As they stood there in the quiet of the town square, the soft murmur of voices around them, Talon felt a strange sense of peace settle over him. The pulse was gone, but they were still here. And as long as they were still standing, there was hope.

“We’ll figure it out,” Talon said, his voice steady. “One step at a time.”

The wind stirred gently through the streets of Brookridge, carrying with it the echoes of what had been. But for the first time in days, the pulse was silent.

And they were free.

---

**Chapter 14: The Quiet Before the Storm**

Days passed, and Brookridge began to settle back into a fragile sense of normalcy. The pulse was gone, its influence no longer warping time or reality, but its echoes still lingered in the hearts and minds of the townspeople. Though they tried to move forward, the damage was visible in every glance, every hesitant smile. People whispered about the strange things they had seen—memories pulled from their minds, dreams twisted into nightmares.

Talon stood at the edge of the woods, staring at the path that led down to the underground chamber where they had destroyed the pulse. He hadn’t returned since that day, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still down there, waiting. The silence felt unnatural, almost too perfect. The town might have begun to heal, but Talon knew better than to trust the calm.

Behind him, Sari approached, her footsteps soft on the dry leaves. She stopped beside him, her gaze following his toward the path. “You’re thinking about going back down there, aren’t you?”

Talon sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. “I can’t shake the feeling that we missed something. The pulse is gone, but it’s like... I don’t know, like the air hasn’t cleared completely.”

Sari nodded slowly. “I’ve been feeling it too. It’s quieter, but it’s still there. Like an itch you can’t scratch.”

They stood in silence for a moment, the wind stirring the trees around them. Brookridge had returned to a semblance of peace, but it was a peace built on uncertainty. Everyone was waiting, holding their breath, afraid that the pulse might return.

“I don’t want to believe it’s still out there,” Sari said quietly. “After everything we went through, I want to think we’re safe. But the way people are acting... they’re still afraid. Even if they won’t admit it.”

Talon glanced at her, his eyes narrowing. “Do you think we’re still connected to it?”

Sari shrugged, looking down at the ground. “Maybe. Or maybe it’s just that what we went through changed us. Jack... he lost himself to it, and it makes me wonder—did we? Are we ever going to be the same?”

Talon didn’t have an answer. He wanted to believe that they had survived the pulse and come out the other side stronger, but the truth was, the experience had left scars that ran deeper than any of them wanted to admit.

“We have to go back,” Talon said after a long pause. “We need to be sure. If there’s any trace of the pulse left down there, we need to destroy it for good.”

Sari frowned. “You really think it’s still alive?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted. “But I don’t want to wait around to find out.”

***

They gathered the others later that afternoon. Dystiny and Father Nathan arrived at Talon’s house, their faces etched with exhaustion. Neither of them had slept well since the pulse was silenced. Dystiny still had dark circles under her eyes, and Father Nathan’s movements were slower, as if he were carrying the weight of the town’s fears on his shoulders.

“We’re going back down,” Talon said as they sat in the living room. “I know we thought it was over, but I’ve been feeling something... off. The pulse may be gone, but I don’t think we’re finished.”

Dystiny raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. “You think there’s more down there? We destroyed the core, didn’t we?”

Talon nodded. “We did. But what if it wasn’t just about the core? What if the pulse has other... layers? Other parts we didn’t see?”

Father Nathan crossed his arms, his brow furrowed. “You believe the pulse was more than just a single entity?”

Talon shrugged. “I don’t know. But it was feeding on something. Memories, fear, guilt. It was alive, and it was hungry. What if we only killed part of it?”

Sari leaned forward, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. “We can’t take any chances. If there’s even a trace of the pulse left, we need to find it and destroy it before it starts growing again.”

Dystiny glanced around the room, her gaze lingering on each of them. “I thought we were done with this,” she muttered, shaking her head. “I don’t know if I can go back down there.”

Talon understood her hesitation. The underground chamber had been a place of horror, where they had all been forced to confront their darkest fears and memories. Going back felt like tempting fate, like opening a door they had only just managed to close.

“I don’t want to go back either,” Talon admitted. “But if we don’t make sure it’s really over, we’ll never know. We’ll always be looking over our shoulders, waiting for the pulse to return.”

Father Nathan nodded solemnly. “He’s right. We must have faith, yes, but we must also take action. If there’s a chance the pulse still has a hold on this town, we can’t ignore it.”

Dystiny sighed, running a hand through her hair. “Fine. But if we’re going down there again, we need to be prepared. Last time, we barely made it out.”

“I agree,” Sari said. “We need to bring supplies. Flashlights, rope, anything that will help us get in and out quickly.”

Talon stood, his expression resolute. “We leave at first light.”

***

The next morning, they gathered at the entrance to the woods, the sun barely visible through the gray clouds that hung low over the town. Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan stood in a loose circle, their packs filled with supplies. The weight of what they were about to do hung heavy in the air.

Talon took a deep breath, his eyes scanning the woods. “This time, we’re going to end it. Whatever’s down there, we’re not leaving until we’re sure it’s gone.”

Sari nodded, her face pale but determined. “Let’s do this.”

They descended into the tunnel once more, the familiar sense of dread settling over them as the darkness closed in. The air was damp and cold, and the pulse—though gone—seemed to echo faintly in the silence. Talon felt a knot form in his stomach as they reached the underground chamber.

It was just as they had left it—silent, still, and lifeless. But there was something different this time, something subtle but undeniable. The symbols on the walls, once glowing faintly, were now dark, their energy seemingly drained. The stone structure at the center of the chamber lay in ruins, cracked and broken from their previous confrontation.

“I don’t like this,” Dystiny muttered, her voice tight. “It feels... too quiet.”

Father Nathan moved cautiously toward the center of the room, his hand gripping his rosary tightly. “Whatever presence was here, it’s gone. But I sense something else—an emptiness.”

Talon stepped closer to the broken structure, his eyes scanning the ground. There was no sign of life, no trace of the pulse’s energy. But deep in his gut, he felt the same nagging suspicion that had brought them back down here.

Sari walked beside him, her eyes narrowed. “Do you feel that?”

Talon nodded. “It’s like... something’s waiting.”

Suddenly, Dystiny gasped, her hand flying to her chest. “Wait. Do you hear that?”

The others froze, straining to listen. At first, there was only silence. But then, faintly, they heard it—a low, rhythmic sound, barely audible but unmistakable.

The pulse.

“No,” Sari whispered, her voice filled with dread. “It’s still here.”

Talon’s heart pounded in his chest as the pulse’s faint rhythm grew louder, vibrating through the floor beneath their feet.

“We missed something,” he said, his voice tight. “It’s still alive.”

The pulse, though weakened, had not been fully destroyed. It was still hiding, still waiting for the right moment to strike.

And this time, it wasn’t going to let them leave.

---

**Chapter 15: Descent into Madness**

The pulse returned with a subtle vengeance, creeping through the floor like a slow, sickening tremor. Talon’s heart clenched in his chest as the sound grew louder, the steady rhythm crawling up his spine. It was weaker, but unmistakably there—the pulse was not dead.

“We need to leave,” Dystiny whispered, her voice shaky. “Now.”

“No,” Talon said firmly, even as the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. “We’ve come this far. If we leave now, we might not get another chance. We need to finish what we started.”

Sari’s face was pale, her hand clutching a flashlight so tightly her knuckles had gone white. “But how? The pulse isn’t just a physical thing—it’s alive, and it’s... it’s hungry.”

Father Nathan gripped his rosary tighter, his face a mask of calm determination. “We must find its source—the real source. We destroyed part of it, but it was only a fragment. The true heart of this thing is still hidden.”

Talon stepped toward the center of the chamber, scanning the broken stone structure. The symbols on the walls flickered faintly, barely glowing, as if feeding on the pulse’s remaining energy. “There has to be another way in. Something deeper.”

“We never explored all the tunnels,” Dystiny said, her voice tinged with regret. “There could be more—an entire system we haven’t touched.”

Talon nodded. “Then that’s where we need to go. Deeper into the tunnels. Whatever’s left of the pulse, it’s hiding somewhere below.”

The group exchanged tense glances, each of them knowing that this could be their last descent into the depths. But there was no turning back now. If they didn’t destroy the pulse at its core, it would rise again, stronger than before.

“Let’s find this thing and end it,” Talon said, his voice steady, though his stomach churned with fear.

***

They moved deeper into the tunnel system, the walls closing in around them as the air grew colder. The further they walked, the more oppressive the atmosphere became, as if the very earth itself were suffocating them. The pulse echoed faintly in the background, a constant reminder that they were never truly alone down here.

“Do you see that?” Sari asked, pointing her flashlight toward a narrow crevice in the stone wall.

Talon shone his light in the same direction, revealing a small opening barely wide enough for a person to squeeze through. Faintly, from the other side, they could hear the pulse—louder now, more insistent.

“It’s coming from there,” Talon said. “This is it.”

Dystiny eyed the crevice warily. “That’s a tight fit.”

“We don’t have a choice,” Talon said, stepping forward. “If the pulse is in there, we need to follow it.”

One by one, they squeezed through the narrow opening, their bodies pressed tightly against the cold stone as they crawled into the hidden tunnel. The passage was dark and cramped, barely wide enough to move. The pulse grew louder, its beat quickening, as if sensing their approach.

After what felt like hours, the tunnel opened into a vast underground chamber—much larger than the one they had seen before. The walls were lined with more of the strange symbols, but these symbols glowed brighter, pulsing in time with the beat of the pulse. At the center of the chamber, half-buried in the earth, was a massive stone monolith, covered in intricate carvings that seemed to move and shift as they watched.

Talon’s breath caught in his throat. “This is it. This is the heart of the pulse.”

Sari’s eyes widened as she stared at the monolith. “It’s alive.”

The air in the chamber was thick with energy, crackling with static. The pulse throbbed violently now, its rhythm matching the pounding in Talon’s chest. He could feel it pulling at him, tugging at the edges of his mind, whispering promises of power, of control. It was the same temptation that had taken Jack.

“We have to destroy it,” Talon said, forcing himself to move closer to the monolith. “This is the source. If we destroy this, the pulse dies.”

“But how?” Dystiny asked, her voice barely audible over the roar of the pulse. “It’s huge. We don’t even know what it is.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his rosary clutched tightly in his hand. “It’s more than just a stone. It’s a conduit—a vessel for something dark, something ancient. We must sever the connection.”

Talon reached out cautiously, his hand hovering just above the surface of the monolith. The pulse surged through him, vibrating in his bones, and for a moment, he felt something—a presence, watching him, waiting.

Then, with a jolt, the monolith came alive.

The carvings on its surface began to twist and shift, the symbols glowing brighter as the pulse roared to life. The ground beneath their feet trembled, and the air crackled with electricity. The pulse wasn’t just a sound anymore—it was a force, alive and aware, and it was angry.

Sari stumbled back, her flashlight shaking in her hand. “Talon, what’s happening?”

Talon’s heart pounded as the pulse intensified, its beat erratic and wild. The symbols on the walls pulsed violently, their light flickering as the chamber itself seemed to warp and bend around them.

“The pulse knows we’re here,” Talon said, his voice strained. “It’s fighting back.”

The ground shook harder, and cracks began to form in the stone beneath their feet. The pulse was overwhelming now, deafening, its energy filling the chamber with a violent hum. Talon’s vision blurred, the world around him flickering in and out of focus as reality itself bent under the weight of the pulse’s power.

“We have to do something!” Sari shouted, her voice barely audible over the roar.

Talon’s mind raced. The pulse was feeding on them, drawing on their emotions, their fear. It had always been tied to them, feeding on their memories, their guilt. If they wanted to stop it, they had to sever that connection once and for all.

“The symbols,” Talon said, pointing to the walls. “They’re connected to the pulse. If we can break the connection, we might be able to weaken it.”

Father Nathan nodded, his voice filled with quiet determination. “We must break the hold it has on us—on our minds, our souls. We must free ourselves from its influence.”

“But how?” Dystiny asked, her voice trembling. “How do we break something like this?”

Talon glanced at the glowing symbols, their light pulsing in time with the beat of the pulse. “We fight it. We reject it. We have to confront whatever the pulse has been using against us—our fears, our guilt—and let it go.”

The pulse surged again, stronger this time, and Talon felt it tugging at his mind, pulling him deeper into the darkness. His vision blurred, and for a moment, he saw Tyler again—his younger brother, standing at the edge of the woods, eyes wide with fear.

No. Not again.

Talon clenched his fists, forcing the memory away. Tyler was gone, and it wasn’t his fault. He couldn’t change the past, but he could control what the pulse did with it.

“We won’t let it control us anymore,” Talon said, his voice filled with resolve. “We’ve faced our fears before, and we survived. We can do it again.”

One by one, the others nodded, their faces grim but determined. Together, they turned toward the monolith, their hands outstretched as they focused on the pulse’s energy, on the memories and emotions it had twisted and used against them.

The pulse roared, the ground shaking violently beneath their feet, but they stood firm, their minds clear and focused. They had faced the pulse before, and this time, they wouldn’t let it take them.

The symbols on the walls flickered, their light dimming as the pulse weakened, its grip on them loosening. The monolith trembled, cracks forming along its surface as the energy inside it began to unravel.

And then, with a deafening crack, the monolith shattered.

The pulse let out one final, desperate surge of energy before it collapsed, its rhythm fading into silence.

The chamber was still.

Talon collapsed to his knees, gasping for breath. The pulse was gone—truly gone this time. The air around them was quiet, the oppressive weight lifted.

“It’s over,” Sari whispered, her voice trembling. “We did it.”

Father Nathan knelt beside Talon, his face filled with quiet relief. “The pulse has been silenced.”

Dystiny leaned against the wall, her face pale but filled with a sense of peace. “We’re free.”

For the first time in days, Talon allowed himself to believe it.

The pulse was dead.

And Brookridge was safe.

---

**Chapter 16: Aftermath**

The days following the destruction of the pulse were a blur. Brookridge, a town that had teetered on the edge of oblivion, now stood in an uneasy calm. There was no celebration, no grand relief—just a quiet acceptance that they had survived. The pulse was gone, and yet, the town felt hollow, like a wound that had healed but left behind a deep scar.

Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan returned to their daily lives, though everything seemed different now. The pulse had left its mark on each of them, in ways that could not be undone. The symbols on the walls of the underground chamber haunted their dreams, and the weight of what they had done—what they had survived—pressed on them in the quiet moments when the world seemed too still.

Talon walked through the center of town, watching as people went about their business with an unfamiliar unease. The normal routines had resumed, but there was a strange tension in the air. It was as if the town was waiting for something else to go wrong, for another crack in reality to appear.

“They don’t trust it,” Sari said quietly as she joined Talon on his walk. Her eyes followed the same nervous glances from townspeople who seemed unsure whether they were truly free. “No one does.”

Talon nodded, his brow furrowed. “I don’t blame them. Even I can’t shake the feeling that... we didn’t see everything. There was something bigger, something beyond the pulse that was just out of reach.”

“Do you really think we missed something?” Sari asked, her voice heavy with concern.

Talon paused, looking at the cracked pavement beneath his feet. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the aftermath, the fact that we went through something so intense. But there’s this part of me that feels like the pulse wasn’t the only threat.”

Sari sighed, rubbing her arms against the cold wind. “It’s the same for me. I wake up at night expecting to hear it again, that thrumming in the ground. But it’s not there. It’s just... silent.”

They continued walking, the weight of their unspoken fears heavy between them. The town was silent in a way that felt unnatural, as though the pulse had taken something vital with it when it disappeared.

“Have you seen Father Nathan today?” Sari asked, changing the subject.

Talon shook his head. “Not since yesterday. He’s been spending most of his time in the church, praying. I think the whole thing shook him more than he lets on.”

Sari nodded. “And Dystiny?”

“She’s been keeping to herself. She’s been through a lot, and I think she’s still processing everything that happened.”

Sari was quiet for a moment, then glanced up at Talon. “And you? How are you holding up?”

Talon hesitated. “I don’t know. I feel like we did the right thing—like we stopped something that could have destroyed everything. But I also feel... unfinished. Like there’s still something out there, something waiting.”

Sari’s eyes softened with understanding. “We’ve been through hell, Talon. It’s going to take time for any of us to feel normal again.”

Talon gave a small nod, though he wasn’t sure if normal was something any of them would ever feel again. The pulse had taken them to the edge of madness, forced them to confront the worst parts of themselves, and now, even in its absence, its shadow still loomed over them.

They reached the edge of town, where the woods began. The trees stood tall and silent, their branches swaying gently in the wind. Talon stared at the path that led down to the underground chamber—the place where everything had started, and where it had ended.

“Do you ever wonder,” Sari said, breaking the silence, “what would have happened if we hadn’t stopped it? If the pulse had grown stronger?”

Talon didn’t answer at first. He didn’t have to. The answer was in the way the town looked now, in the quiet fear that clung to every corner, every shadow. If they hadn’t stopped the pulse, Brookridge would have been consumed, lost to the same twisted reality that had trapped them all.

“We did what we had to,” Talon said finally. “We saved the town. That’s what matters.”

Sari smiled faintly, though her eyes remained distant. “You’re right. We did.”

But as they stood there, staring into the quiet woods, a nagging sense of unease crept back into Talon’s mind. There was something in those woods—something they had left behind. He could feel it, like a distant hum, barely perceptible, but there.

“You feel it too, don’t you?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon nodded slowly. “Yeah. It’s faint, but it’s still there. The pulse may be gone, but whatever it was connected to... it’s not finished.”

Sari shivered, though the air wasn’t particularly cold. “What do we do now?”

Talon didn’t have an answer. They had destroyed the monolith, silenced the pulse, but they hadn’t destroyed the feeling that something was still lurking in the shadows, waiting for its moment to return.

“We keep watch,” Talon said quietly. “We don’t let our guard down. If there’s something left, something that survived... we’ll be ready for it.”

Sari looked at him, her expression filled with a mix of fear and resolve. “Then we stay vigilant.”

As they turned to head back into town, the wind picked up, rustling the leaves around them. The woods seemed to sigh, as though exhaling a breath it had been holding for far too long.

And for the first time in days, Talon felt a strange sense of calm settle over him. Whatever was out there, waiting in the darkness, he knew they would face it together.

***

That night, Talon lay awake, staring at the ceiling as the silence of the house pressed down on him. The events of the past weeks weighed heavily on his mind, and no matter how hard he tried to shake the feeling, he couldn’t escape the lingering unease that gnawed at him.

Suddenly, a sound broke through the quiet—a soft, rhythmic thrum.

Talon sat up, his heart racing as he strained to listen.

The sound was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was there, vibrating through the walls, through the floor. A pulse.

“No,” he whispered, his hands clenching the blankets. “It’s gone. We destroyed it.”

But as the sound grew louder, more insistent, Talon knew the truth.

The pulse hadn’t been destroyed. It had only gone dormant.

And now, it was waking up again.

---

**Chapter 17: The Return**

Talon’s heartbeat quickened, syncing with the faint thrum that now seemed to vibrate through the walls of his house. He couldn’t deny it any longer—the pulse had returned. His mind raced with the implications. After everything they had done, after the monolith had been destroyed, how was this even possible?

He quickly dressed, throwing on his jacket, and grabbed a flashlight before heading out into the cool night air. Brookridge was eerily quiet, as if the entire town had collectively held its breath. The pulse, though faint, was unmistakable. It was subtle, almost as if it were testing the air, waiting to fully reveal itself.

Talon’s first thought was to find Sari. He needed to know if she could hear it too, if she felt the same dread that was now clawing at his insides. He moved quickly down the dark streets, his flashlight sweeping across the deserted sidewalks. He reached her house, his hand trembling slightly as he knocked on the door.

Moments later, the door opened, and Sari stood there, her eyes wide and full of the same fear Talon had felt only minutes earlier. “You hear it too, don’t you?” she whispered.

Talon nodded, his mouth dry. “It’s back.”

Sari stepped outside, pulling her jacket tighter around her shoulders. “I thought we stopped it, Talon. We destroyed the monolith. How is this possible?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted, his mind spinning. “But we can’t waste time wondering. If the pulse is coming back, we need to figure out why and stop it for good.”

“Do you think Dystiny and Father Nathan have noticed it too?” Sari asked, glancing toward the church.

Talon frowned. “We should check on them. If they’re hearing it, we’ll need their help.”

They moved quickly through the streets, the pulse growing ever so slightly stronger with each step. It wasn’t like before—there were no reality-bending surges or moments of lost time—but the pulse was unmistakably there, and it was waking up.

When they reached the church, the heavy wooden door creaked as Talon pushed it open. The air inside was thick with the smell of old wood and candle wax. Father Nathan was kneeling at the altar, his rosary clutched tightly in his hands. His head snapped up as soon as Talon and Sari entered, his eyes wide and filled with a quiet understanding.

“You hear it too,” Father Nathan said, his voice low. It wasn’t a question—it was a statement of fact.

“Yes,” Talon replied. “It’s faint, but it’s back. Do you have any idea how?”

Father Nathan stood slowly, the rosary still wrapped tightly around his fingers. “I feared this might happen. When we destroyed the monolith, I thought we had silenced the pulse for good, but... there was always the possibility that the pulse wasn’t just coming from the monolith.”

“What do you mean?” Sari asked, her voice tense.

Father Nathan walked to the stained glass window and stared out at the dark town. “The pulse was always more than just a physical entity. It’s been tied to the town, to all of us. When we faced it, we thought we were confronting a single source, but it may have spread further than we realized.”

Talon clenched his fists. “So you’re saying it was never just about the monolith?”

“I believe the pulse had roots deeper than we knew,” Father Nathan said softly. “We severed one of its connections, but there may be more.”

“Where’s Dystiny?” Sari asked, her eyes darting around the empty church. “We need to find her.”

“She left earlier,” Father Nathan replied. “I’m not sure where she went, but she said she needed to clear her head. She seemed... restless.”

Talon’s stomach twisted. If Dystiny was out there alone, she might be in danger. The pulse, even in its weakened state, could still exert its influence, especially on someone who had already been through so much.

“We need to find her,” Talon said, his voice urgent. “If the pulse is coming back, she could be vulnerable.”

The three of them hurried out of the church and into the cold night air, their breath visible in the glow of the streetlights. The pulse was growing stronger now, its rhythm steady but ominous, like a slow, ticking clock counting down to something terrible.

“Where would she go?” Sari asked, scanning the empty streets.

Talon thought for a moment. Dystiny had always been drawn to places that reminded her of what they had faced, as if revisiting those moments gave her a sense of control. “The woods,” he said finally. “She’d go back to where it all started. The clearing.”

They headed toward the woods, their pace quickening as the pulse grew louder with each step. The trees loomed overhead, their branches swaying gently in the wind. Talon’s flashlight cut through the darkness, illuminating the narrow path that led deeper into the woods.

When they reached the clearing, Dystiny was standing in the center, her back to them. She was staring at the spot where the monolith had once stood, her body tense, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.

“Dystiny!” Sari called out, her voice filled with concern.

Dystiny turned slowly, her face pale but calm. “You hear it too, don’t you?” she asked, her voice quiet but steady.

Talon nodded as they approached her. “It’s back.”

“I knew it wasn’t over,” Dystiny said, her eyes dark and unreadable. “Even when we destroyed the monolith, I could feel it—something else was still out there. The pulse wasn’t just tied to that stone. It was tied to us.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his expression grave. “We may have cut off one of its lifelines, but the pulse had already spread. It’s part of Brookridge now—part of all of us.”

Dystiny’s eyes flickered with something—fear, perhaps, or resignation. “So what do we do now? We can’t destroy it, not if it’s become part of us.”

Talon felt a chill run down his spine. The pulse had embedded itself into their very existence, like a virus, feeding on their emotions, their memories, their guilt. Destroying it might not be possible, not without tearing apart everything it had touched.

“We fight it,” Talon said, his voice filled with quiet determination. “We don’t let it control us again. We find whatever connection it still has to this town and sever it.”

“But how?” Sari asked, her voice filled with uncertainty. “How do we fight something that’s become part of us?”

Father Nathan looked up at the sky, his expression thoughtful. “There may still be a way. The pulse feeds on fear, on guilt, on the darkest parts of us. It thrives because we give it power. If we refuse to let it control us—if we confront the parts of ourselves it’s been feeding on—we may be able to weaken it.”

Dystiny’s brow furrowed. “So we just... stop being afraid? Stop feeling guilt?”

“It’s not about suppressing those feelings,” Father Nathan explained. “It’s about confronting them. The pulse can only take hold of what we let it. If we face our demons—if we refuse to let them control us—the pulse will lose its grip.”

Talon’s mind raced. It sounded almost too simple, but after everything they had been through, it made a certain kind of sense. The pulse had always fed on their emotions, on their memories. It had twisted reality because it had drawn power from them. If they took that power away, perhaps the pulse would finally die.

“Then that’s what we do,” Talon said, his voice steady. “We face it. Whatever it shows us, whatever it uses against us, we face it head-on.”

Dystiny looked down at the ground, her expression conflicted. “I don’t know if I can go through that again. The last time I faced what the pulse showed me... it nearly broke me.”

Talon placed a hand on her shoulder, his voice gentle but firm. “You’re not alone this time. We face it together.”

The pulse thrummed beneath their feet, growing louder, more insistent. It was waiting for them, daring them to confront the darkness it had planted in their hearts.

Talon took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. They had faced the pulse before, and they had survived. But this time, the stakes were higher. This time, they weren’t just fighting for their town—they were fighting for themselves.

“We end this,” Talon said, his voice filled with quiet resolve.

And with that, they stepped forward, ready to face the pulse one final time.

---

**Chapter 18: The Final Confrontation**

The pulse thrummed louder with every step they took. Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan walked in silence, the rhythm of the pulse in sync with their racing hearts. The path through the woods felt darker than before, the trees towering like silent sentinels watching their march toward the inevitable. The air felt thick, heavy with the weight of what they were about to face.

Talon kept his flashlight steady, casting the beam across the ground as they made their way deeper into the forest, back to the place where they had first felt the pulse’s malevolent presence. He could sense it now, more clearly than ever—an energy that hummed just beneath the surface, vibrating through the earth and crawling up his spine. The pulse was still weak, but it was waking up, growing stronger with each passing moment.

“We’re almost there,” Sari said quietly, her voice barely audible over the sound of their footsteps.

Talon nodded, his jaw clenched. “We end this tonight.”

As they reached the clearing, the pulse surged suddenly, as if sensing their arrival. The ground beneath them seemed to vibrate with the rhythm, and for a moment, Talon felt the same dizzying sensation of time slipping away, like it had before, when the pulse had been at its height.

In the center of the clearing, the remains of the shattered monolith lay scattered, half-buried in the earth. The carvings that had once pulsed with energy were now dark and lifeless, but the ground around them glowed faintly with a sickly light, as if something was still lurking just beneath the surface.

“This is where it all started,” Dystiny whispered, her voice trembling. “And where it will end.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his rosary clutched tightly in his hands. “We must stand strong. The pulse will try to use our fears, our regrets against us again. But we’ve faced it once before—we can face it again.”

Talon took a deep breath, steadying himself as he moved closer to the center of the clearing. The pulse was growing stronger now, its rhythm more chaotic, more insistent. It was waiting for them, daring them to make the first move.

“What do we do?” Sari asked, her voice tight with tension.

“We confront it,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We face whatever it shows us, and we don’t let it take control. The pulse feeds on fear, on guilt. If we refuse to give it power, we can sever its hold.”

Dystiny looked at the shattered remains of the monolith, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and determination. “And if it tries to trap us in the loops again? What then?”

“We stay together,” Talon said. “No matter what it shows us, no matter what it throws at us, we don’t get lost in it. We face it as one.”

They stood in a circle around the remnants of the monolith, the faint light pulsing beneath the earth casting long, eerie shadows across the clearing. The pulse throbbed louder, its beat erratic, and the air around them seemed to crackle with energy.

Then, without warning, the ground beneath their feet shifted.

The world tilted, and Talon felt a sudden, sickening jolt in his stomach. The trees blurred, the sky darkened, and for a moment, everything seemed to spin. When the world snapped back into focus, Talon found himself standing in a familiar place—an all-too-familiar place.

He was in the woods again, but it wasn’t the woods of Brookridge. It was the same twisted, distorted version of the forest that the pulse had shown him before. The trees were dark, gnarled, their branches reaching out like claws. The air was thick with the smell of decay, and the sky above was an angry shade of red.

Talon’s heart pounded as he realized what had happened. The pulse had pulled them back into its twisted reality, a place where time and memory were no longer stable. A place where the past and present bled together.

“Sari?” he called out, his voice echoing through the warped forest. “Dystiny? Father Nathan?”

There was no response.

Talon spun around, panic rising in his chest. The others were gone—separated, scattered across whatever distorted version of reality the pulse had created for them.

“No,” Talon muttered under his breath. “This is what it wants.”

The pulse was trying to isolate them, to trap them in their own personal hells, just like it had before. Talon clenched his fists, his mind racing. He couldn’t let it control him. He had to find the others. Together, they had a chance of defeating the pulse. Alone, they would be lost.

He started running, weaving through the twisted trees, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The pulse’s rhythm pounded in his ears, growing louder with each step. The world around him seemed to warp and shift, as if reality itself was bending under the weight of the pulse’s influence.

Talon didn’t stop. He couldn’t stop. He had to keep moving, had to find the others.

Then, suddenly, the trees parted, and Talon skidded to a halt.

In front of him stood Tyler.

His younger brother stood at the edge of the clearing, just as he had before. His eyes wide, his face pale with fear. The same scene, the same memory that the pulse had used against Talon time and time again.

“No,” Talon whispered, shaking his head. “You’re not real. You’re just a memory.”

But Tyler didn’t move. He just stood there, staring at Talon with those wide, terrified eyes.

“I’m sorry,” Talon said, his voice breaking. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you. But you’re gone. You’ve been gone for years. I can’t change that.”

Tyler’s expression didn’t change. He just stood there, unmoving, like a ghost frozen in time.

Talon clenched his fists, forcing himself to take a step forward. “I let you go once before, and I’ll do it again. You’re not real. You’re not here.”

The pulse surged, and for a moment, the world seemed to flicker. Talon’s heart pounded, but he stood his ground. He had faced this memory before, faced the guilt that had eaten away at him for so many years. And he had let it go.

The pulse couldn’t control him anymore.

With a final surge of determination, Talon stepped forward, walking past the image of his brother. The world flickered again, the twisted trees and blood-red sky fading in and out of focus.

And then, with a sudden, jarring shift, the world snapped back into place.

Talon found himself back in the clearing, standing at the center of the circle around the shattered monolith. The pulse was still there, but it was weaker now—its rhythm erratic, uneven.

Sari appeared beside him, her face pale but determined. “I saw... my family again,” she said softly, her voice trembling. “But it didn’t work. I didn’t let it take control.”

Father Nathan stood on the other side, his rosary clutched tightly in his hands. “The pulse is losing its hold. We’re breaking free.”

Dystiny stumbled forward, her eyes wide with fear. “It tried to show me the future again—tried to trap me in that twisted version of Brookridge. But I didn’t fall for it this time.”

Talon nodded, his heart racing. “We’re almost there. It’s weakening. We just need to hold on.”

The pulse surged one final time, a desperate, erratic beat that vibrated through the earth. The ground beneath them trembled, and the air crackled with energy. The light from the shattered monolith flickered, growing dimmer with each passing second.

And then, with a final, shuddering pulse, it stopped.

The clearing fell silent.

The faint light that had pulsed beneath the earth faded away, and the oppressive energy that had filled the air dissipated. The pulse was gone—truly gone this time.

Talon let out a shaky breath, his entire body trembling with exhaustion. It was over.

They had won.

“We did it,” Sari whispered, her voice filled with disbelief. “It’s really over.”

Father Nathan crossed himself, his face pale but filled with quiet relief. “The pulse is dead.”

Dystiny collapsed to her knees, tears streaming down her face. “I can’t believe it...”

Talon stared at the shattered remains of the monolith, his heart still racing. The pulse was gone, but its memory would linger. It had tested them, pushed them to their limits, but they had survived.

And for the first time in what felt like forever, Talon felt a sense of peace.

The nightmare was finally over.

**Chapter 19: Picking Up the Pieces**

The dawn that followed the pulse’s final defeat was unlike any Talon had experienced in Brookridge before. The sky was streaked with pale shades of pink and gold, casting the town in a soft, almost ethereal light. For the first time in days, the air felt clear—clean, as though the oppressive weight that had hung over Brookridge had finally lifted.

Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan stood in the clearing, their faces bathed in the early morning light. The shattered remains of the monolith lay at their feet, now just lifeless stone, no longer pulsing with the malevolent energy that had once threatened to tear apart their world.

“It’s really over,” Sari said, her voice still tinged with disbelief. She knelt by the broken fragments of the monolith, brushing her fingers lightly over the cold stone. “I thought we’d never be free of it.”

Talon took a deep breath, feeling the tension slowly drain from his body. For so long, they had been fighting—first to survive, then to understand, and finally to destroy the pulse. Now, standing in the quiet aftermath, he felt a strange sense of calm. The fight was over. The pulse was truly dead.

“We survived,” Talon said, his voice steady. “All of us.”

Father Nathan nodded, his rosary still clutched tightly in his hand. “By God’s grace, we made it through. But this victory wasn’t without cost.”

Dystiny stood a few steps away, her arms wrapped around herself. She hadn’t spoken much since the pulse had finally died. Talon knew the experience had taken a heavy toll on her. They had all faced their deepest fears, but for Dystiny, the pulse had shown her a future that was still raw, still possible.

“How are you feeling?” Talon asked, walking over to her.

Dystiny looked up, her eyes clouded with emotion. “I don’t know. Relieved, I guess. But I also feel... empty. Like the pulse took something from me, and now that it’s gone, I don’t know what’s left.”

Talon nodded, understanding her words all too well. The pulse had fed on their fears, their guilt, their darkest memories. Now that it was gone, there was a void where those emotions had once been. It was a strange, hollow feeling, one that would take time to understand and heal from.

“We’ll figure it out,” Talon said gently. “Together.”

Dystiny gave a small, hesitant smile. “Yeah. I hope so.”

The group lingered in the clearing for a while longer, none of them quite ready to leave the place where they had fought their final battle. There was a strange sense of closure here, but also a feeling that their journey wasn’t truly over. They had defeated the pulse, but the scars it left behind would take time to heal.

Eventually, Father Nathan broke the silence. “We should return to town. The people of Brookridge will need us now more than ever. They’ve been through as much as we have.”

Talon nodded, and together they began the walk back through the woods, the faint sounds of birds waking up to the morning filling the air. The path felt different now—less foreboding, as though the pulse’s influence had been erased from the earth itself.

As they entered the town, the quiet streets began to stir with life. People were emerging from their homes, their faces etched with uncertainty but also with a sense of hope. The air, once thick with fear and confusion, now felt lighter. Talon could see it in the way people moved, cautiously at first, but with growing confidence as they realized the pulse was truly gone.

Sari glanced around, her eyes scanning the faces of the townspeople. “They don’t know what happened, do they?”

Father Nathan shook his head. “Not fully. They felt the pulse, experienced its effects, but they don’t know the full extent of what we faced. It’s probably best if they don’t.”

Talon agreed. The truth of what they had gone through—the twisted realities, the personal confrontations with their worst memories—was something that might be too much for the townspeople to understand. It was enough for them to know that the pulse was gone and that they were safe.

“They’ll heal,” Talon said, watching as people slowly began to talk to one another, their voices filled with quiet relief. “In time, we all will.”

As the day wore on, the group dispersed, each of them returning to their respective homes. There was still much to process, and they all needed time to come to terms with what had happened. Talon found himself back at his house, standing by the window, staring out at the town that had once seemed so alien, so twisted. Now it was just Brookridge again—his home.

But even as the town returned to normal, Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that he had changed. The pulse had forced him to confront parts of himself that he had long buried, and while he had survived, he knew he would never be the same. None of them would.

***

Days passed, and life in Brookridge slowly returned to a semblance of normalcy. The townspeople resumed their daily routines, though there was a lingering wariness in the air, a collective understanding that something had been taken from them. The pulse had touched every life in Brookridge, and while it was gone, its echoes would remain for a long time.

Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan met regularly, checking in on one another, making sure they were all healing in their own ways. The bond they had formed through their shared ordeal had only grown stronger, and they found comfort in each other’s company.

One afternoon, as they sat together at the diner, Sari spoke up. “Do you think we’ll ever fully recover? From the pulse, I mean.”

Father Nathan was thoughtful for a moment. “We may not return to who we were before, but that’s not always a bad thing. We faced something unimaginable and came out the other side. That changes people. It makes us stronger.”

Dystiny nodded, her gaze distant. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget what the pulse showed me. That future it trapped me in... it felt so real. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe we’re meant to carry those experiences with us, so we can learn from them.”

Talon looked around at his friends, feeling a deep sense of gratitude. They had been through hell together, and while they still had a long way to go, they had made it. They had survived.

“We’ll be okay,” Talon said, his voice filled with quiet conviction. “It’ll take time, but we’ll be okay.”

As the sun set over Brookridge, casting the town in a warm, golden light, Talon felt a sense of peace settle over him. The pulse was gone. The town was healing. And though they had been tested in ways they could never have imagined, they had come out the other side stronger, more united.

For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Talon believed that the future—whatever it held—would be theirs to shape.

**Chapter 20: A New Dawn**

The morning air was crisp and cool, a gentle breeze rustling the leaves as Talon walked through the center of Brookridge. The town had begun to wake up from its long, nightmare-induced slumber. Each day, the people moved a little more freely, spoke a little more openly, as though they were slowly remembering what it felt like to be alive without fear. The pulse was gone, but its presence had left scars that time alone couldn’t heal.

Talon passed by the diner, catching sight of familiar faces through the window. Some of the townspeople gave him small nods of acknowledgment. They didn’t know the full story of what he, Sari, Dystiny, and Father Nathan had gone through to rid the town of the pulse, but they sensed it. They understood, on some instinctual level, that something dark had been warded off, and they were safe because of it.

As Talon approached the park, he saw Sari sitting on one of the benches, staring out at the children playing nearby. She looked different now, not just older, but stronger—wiser, perhaps. They all did. The pulse had stripped them bare, forced them to confront the parts of themselves they had hidden from for so long. But it had also allowed them to rebuild, to become something new.

“Morning,” Talon said, sitting beside her on the bench.

Sari smiled softly. “Morning. Sleep okay?”

“Better,” Talon replied, though he wasn’t entirely sure if that was true. His nights were no longer haunted by the pulse, but sleep still came with difficulty. Dreams of the twisted version of Brookridge, of Tyler, and of the endless loops, lingered in his mind. They were less frequent now, but they weren’t gone.

Sari seemed to read his thoughts. “You still dream about it, don’t you?”

Talon nodded. “Sometimes. It feels like the pulse didn’t just warp reality—it warped us too.”

Sari looked out at the children playing, her gaze softening. “Maybe it did. But I think... I think we needed to be changed. Maybe that’s why we survived.”

Talon didn’t say anything for a moment, letting her words sink in. She was right. The pulse had been a force of destruction, but in its wake, they had emerged as something stronger. They had confronted their deepest fears, their regrets, and had come out the other side. Perhaps that was the pulse’s twisted gift—to break them down so they could be rebuilt.

“Have you seen Dystiny?” Sari asked, breaking the silence.

Talon nodded. “She’s been spending time at the old school. Said it helps her think. I think she’s still trying to figure out what the pulse showed her about the future. She wants to make sure it doesn’t come true.”

Sari frowned. “Do you think it will? The future she saw?”

“I don’t know,” Talon admitted. “But she’s determined to change it. And if anyone can, it’s her.”

The two sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, watching the children run and laugh, their carefree joy a stark contrast to the quiet, reflective nature of the adults who watched over them. The town was healing, but it would take time.

“You should come to the church later,” Sari said suddenly, her voice lighter. “Father Nathan’s planning a small service. Nothing official, just a way to give thanks and... maybe find some closure.”

Talon smiled. “I’ll be there.”

***

Later that afternoon, Talon made his way to the church. The sun was starting to dip lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the town, but the air felt warm, almost comforting. As he walked through the doors, he was greeted by the soft hum of quiet conversation. A few townspeople had gathered, sitting in the wooden pews, their faces calm but thoughtful.

Father Nathan stood at the front, his rosary in hand, though this time he seemed more at ease, more peaceful than Talon had ever seen him. The priest gave a small nod when he saw Talon enter, and Talon made his way to the pew where Sari and Dystiny sat.

“You made it,” Sari whispered with a smile.

Talon nodded, glancing over at Dystiny. She looked more herself today, her usual resolve tempered by a sense of quiet reflection.

“Everything okay?” he asked her softly.

Dystiny gave a small shrug. “I don’t know. I’m still figuring things out. But I think... I’m getting there.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his voice calm and steady as he addressed the small group. “We’ve been through something few people will ever understand. And while we have been given the gift of survival, we have also been given the burden of remembering. The pulse may be gone, but its lessons remain. It forced us to confront the darkest parts of ourselves, and it is now our duty to carry those lessons forward—not with fear, but with strength.”

The townspeople listened quietly, their expressions thoughtful. Talon felt the weight of Father Nathan’s words sink in. The pulse had been a nightmare, a force of destruction, but in the end, it had shown them who they truly were. It had revealed their weaknesses, but also their strengths.

“We are stronger now,” Father Nathan continued. “Stronger because we have faced the darkness and emerged on the other side. The pulse tested us, but we did not break. And that is something to be thankful for.”

Talon’s gaze shifted to the stained-glass windows, the sunlight filtering through in shades of red and gold. The world felt different now—fragile, but full of possibilities. He realized that Brookridge, and perhaps even he himself, was no longer the same. They had all changed, and though the road ahead was uncertain, there was hope.

As the service came to a close, the small group of townspeople dispersed, each lost in their own thoughts. Talon, Sari, and Dystiny lingered for a moment longer, watching as Father Nathan extinguished the candles at the front of the church.

“I think I needed that,” Sari said quietly. “Some closure.”

Dystiny nodded. “Me too. We’ve been carrying this for so long. It’s good to finally put it down.”

Talon smiled at them both, feeling a warmth he hadn’t felt in a long time. “We made it through. Together.”

***

That evening, as Talon walked home, the sky painted in shades of purple and orange, he allowed himself to finally relax. The pulse was gone. The town was healing. And so was he.

As he reached his house, he paused, taking one last look at the quiet streets of Brookridge. The town, once haunted by the pulse’s influence, now stood on the edge of something new—something hopeful.

And for the first time in what felt like an eternity, Talon felt ready to move forward.

He stepped inside his house, the warmth of the evening wrapping around him like a comforting embrace.

The nightmare was over.

And tomorrow, a new dawn would rise.
