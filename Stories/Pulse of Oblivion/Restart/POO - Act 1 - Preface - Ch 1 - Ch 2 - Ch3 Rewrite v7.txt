**Preface: The Beginning of the End**

The cabin was quiet, save for the sound of Sari’s quick, shallow breaths as she sat beside Talon. The dim light of the lantern flickered, casting long shadows across his face. His once vibrant skin had turned pale, marred by the dark veins that pulsed beneath, creeping like invasive roots. His breaths came in shallow gasps, each one more fragile than the last.

“Talon,” Sari whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. She reached out, her hand trembling as it brushed the back of his. “**I’m here**. **I’m right here**. You need to fight this.”

His eyes fluttered, a faint movement beneath heavy lids. For a moment, she thought he might wake, but the flicker of life behind his gaze faded just as quickly as it came. His body lay still, the weight of the Pulse dragging him further into the abyss.

“**No**, don’t do this.” Her voice cracked, but she tightened her grip on his hand. “**You’re stronger than this.** I know you can hear me.”

Sari’s thumb traced slow circles against his wrist, a tender gesture amidst the chaos. She’d always believed in him—in his strength, in his will. There had to be something left of him inside. There had to be a way to bring him back.

“Talon... it’s... dark.” His voice was barely audible, a broken whisper. “I’m... slipping.”

His fingers twitched in hers, a faint squeeze, but his hand fell limp once more. Sari’s heart twisted painfully. She could feel him slipping, could see it in the way his chest barely rose with each breath. But she refused to accept it.

“No,” she whispered, her forehead nearly resting against his. “You’re not slipping. **Stay with me, Talon.** We’ve faced worse, remember? **You can beat this.**” Her words were a plea, but they held a fierce determination.

For a moment, his eyes fluttered open again, locking onto hers. A sadness lingered in his gaze, a resignation that clashed with her hope.

“Sari...” His voice was hoarse, strained, as though it took every ounce of strength just to form the words. “I’m... already... gone.”

She shook her head, tears blurring her vision. “**No.** I won’t accept that. **There has to be a way.**” Her voice grew desperate, but even through the tears, her determination shone through. She stood abruptly, her hands shaking as she grabbed a book from the shelf. “There’s something I missed. **There’s always something.**”

She flipped through the pages, searching with frantic energy. Her fingers trembled as she scanned the text, her breath quick and shallow. There had to be an answer—somewhere, buried in all the research, in all the theories. She’d find it. She had to.

Talon’s voice broke through her concentration, weak and distant. “I... can’t... hold on... much longer.”

His hand slipped from hers, falling limp beside him. His head tilted slightly toward her, but his eyes were already drifting closed. Sari’s heart raced as she hurried back to his side, clutching his hand as if she could pull him back from the brink through sheer will alone.

“I’m not losing you.” Her voice was low, a whisper, but it was laced with resolve. “You’re not going anywhere. **I’m not giving up on you.** There has to be something I haven’t tried.”

Sari sat beside him, pulling out her phone, fingers flying across the screen as she searched for any clue, any glimmer of hope. Her breath hitched as she scrolled through her notes, cross-referencing theories, old journals, anything that might help her understand the Pulse.

But no matter how fast she searched, no matter how determined she was, Talon was slipping further away. His breaths grew weaker, shallower.

“Sari...” His voice was barely a whisper now. “You’ve... done enough. You can’t... save me.”

Her heart clenched, her hands trembling as she brushed his hair back from his forehead. “Don’t ask me to stop, Talon. **I can’t.** Not when I’m so close.” Her voice wavered, but her grip on him tightened.

Talon’s eyes fluttered open one last time, locking onto hers with a mix of love and sorrow. His lips parted, but the words didn’t come. His breath hitched, and his hand slipped from hers once more, falling limp on the bed.

Sari’s chest tightened as she watched him, her breath catching in her throat. “I’m not giving up,” she whispered, though the words felt hollow in the heavy silence.

But even as her heart broke, she knew—he was slipping away.

### **Chapter 1: Clinging to Hope**

The cabin felt heavier now, the air thick with an oppressive weight that seemed to press down on her with every breath. It had been days since Talon first started succumbing to the Pulse, and Sari hadn’t left his side since. She paced the small room, her eyes scanning the books and papers scattered across the table.

There had to be something. Some answer. Some clue.

“Talon,” she said softly, glancing at him as he lay motionless on the bed. His breathing was shallow, his body still, but she refused to believe that he was gone. **Not yet**. “I’m not losing you. **There’s something I haven’t tried yet.** I know there is.”

She pushed a strand of hair behind her ear, her movements sharp, almost frantic. Her hands shook as she flipped through the pages of an old journal, scanning for anything that might help. Her eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep, but her mind raced with possibilities.

Talon stirred, his fingers twitching slightly at his side. His eyes opened, just barely, and he looked at her with a weak, tired gaze. “Sari... **you need to rest**. You’re... going to burn yourself out.”

His voice was a shadow of its former self, strained and distant, but Sari’s heart leapt at the sound of it. She crossed the room in two quick steps, kneeling beside him, her hand resting lightly on his chest.

“I’m not resting until I figure this out.” Her voice was low, but there was a fierce determination in her eyes. “I’m not losing you, Talon. **There has to be something.** There’s always something.”

Talon’s hand lifted weakly, reaching out toward her, but it dropped before it could make contact. His eyes fluttered closed again, and for a moment, it looked like he was slipping back into the Pulse’s grasp.

“Sari...” His voice was soft, barely more than a whisper. “You’re... doing too much. I’m not worth losing yourself over.”

His words cut deep, but Sari shook her head, brushing them aside. “Don’t say that. **You’re worth everything.** I just need to find the right solution.”

She moved back to the table, spreading out the books and papers in front of her, her hands trembling slightly as she flipped through them. Every few moments, she glanced back at Talon, watching him closely, her heart racing in her chest. His breaths were slow, but steady, and she held onto that small comfort.

“I can’t fight this anymore,” Talon murmured, his voice weak and broken.

Sari’s chest tightened, her hands freezing mid-motion. She turned to face him, her eyes blazing with determination. “You don’t have to fight it alone. **I’m right here.** I’ll figure this out. **I’m so close.**”

But Talon’s eyes remained closed, his body still. His breath was shallow, his chest barely rising with each inhale.

“Sari...” His voice was barely a breath, but the weight of it hung in the air. “Please... **let me go.** You’ve done enough. You can’t save me.”

Sari’s throat tightened, her hand clenching into a fist. She brushed his hair back again, her touch lingering for a moment longer than before. “Don’t ask me to stop, Talon. **I can’t.** Not now.”

But as his eyes closed once more, Sari’s heart sank. She knew she was running out of time. 

Her fingers tightened around the old journal in her hands, the pages yellowed with age. There had to be something—some solution she hadn’t tried yet. Her breath came in quick, shallow bursts as she flipped through the pages, searching for anything that could save him.

But no matter how fast she searched, no matter how determined she was, the weight of reality pressed down on her.

Talon was slipping further away.

**Chapter 2: The Fight Within**

The walls of the cabin felt as though they were closing in on her, the air thick with tension and the ever-present pulse of the darkness that had begun to consume Talon. Sari sat beside him, her eyes fixed on the black veins that crept along his skin, a cruel reminder of the battle she was losing.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice strained but still clinging to hope. “You’re not slipping away. **You’re not.**” She gripped his hand tightly, as though her sheer force of will could tether him to her. “**Fight this.** You’re stronger than whatever this is. You’ve always been stronger.”

For a brief moment, Talon’s body stilled, and his eyes fluttered open. But the gaze that met hers was distant, hollow, as though part of him was already gone.

“I... can’t... fight it,” Talon murmured, his voice barely more than a breath. His hand twitched in hers, but it was weak, almost imperceptible.

Sari’s heart raced. No. **No**, she wouldn’t let him give up. She leaned closer, her forehead nearly touching his, her grip tightening around his hand until her knuckles turned white. “You can. **You have to.** You don’t get to leave me like this.”

But as she spoke, the weight of his hand grew heavier, and her words hung in the air, unanswered. Her chest tightened, a sharp sting of panic rising in her throat.

“**Damn it, Talon!**” She pulled back, her voice cracking as frustration boiled over. Her hands shook as she ran them through her hair, pacing the small space beside his bed. “**Why won’t you fight harder?** What am I supposed to do?” Her voice trembled, louder now, anger creeping into every word.

Talon’s body convulsed slightly, his breaths shallow and labored. The black veins seemed to pulse with each twitch, as though the Pulse was tightening its grip, squeezing out what little strength he had left.

Sari’s jaw clenched, her frustration giving way to desperation. She grabbed the edge of the chair beside his bed and threw it across the room, the sound of it crashing against the wall doing little to quiet the chaos inside her. “**I’m trying!** I’ve done everything, Talon, but it’s never enough, is it?”

She turned to him again, her breath ragged, her eyes wild with unshed tears. “**Why won’t it stop?** Why can’t I... **why can’t I fix this?**” Her voice cracked as she choked on the last word, her hands clenching into fists at her sides.

Talon’s eyelids fluttered open, and for a moment, the haze lifted. His gaze found hers, and though his voice was weak, there was a flicker of sorrow. “Sari... you shouldn’t... be here. It’s... **my fault**.” He swallowed, his throat tight, and his eyes glistened with guilt. “I let it in. I couldn’t... stop it.”

His words hit her like a punch to the chest, but instead of softening her, they ignited a fire. “Your fault? **Your fault?**” She let out a bitter laugh, though there was no humor in it. “This isn’t just about you, Talon. **This is us.**” Her voice cracked as she stepped closer, her hands shaking as she reached out to touch his face, but stopped short.

“What kind of person am I if I can’t even save you?” she whispered, more to herself than him. Her hands dropped to her sides, her shoulders sagging with the weight of her failure. “**I should be able to fix this.**”

Talon’s eyes filled with regret, his body stilling as another convulsion wracked through him. “You’ve... done enough. Sari... you have to let me go.”

Her breath hitched, her vision blurring as tears finally spilled over. She shook her head, her hands trembling as she reached out for him again. “No. **No, I can’t.** Don’t ask me that.”

But even as she said the words, she could feel the truth settling in, cold and sharp. She wasn’t enough. No matter how hard she tried, no matter what she did—she couldn’t save him. Her hands shook as she gripped the edge of the bed, her nails digging into the wood.

“**I should’ve saved you.**” The anger in her voice cracked, giving way to something rawer, something deeper. “I should’ve figured it out sooner. I should’ve—” She broke off, her voice catching in her throat.

Talon’s eyes flickered, a tear slipping down his cheek as he gazed at her with a mix of love and sorrow. “It’s... not your fault. **I couldn’t... hold on.**”

Sari let out a sob, her knees buckling beneath her as she collapsed to the floor beside him. “But I should’ve done more,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she pounded the floor with her fists, the pain of her failure overwhelming her. “I was supposed to save you... **I failed.**”

The room was silent save for the sound of her sobs, her body shaking with each one. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him, couldn’t bear to see the truth in his eyes. Talon’s hand twitched weakly, his fingers reaching out toward her. But his body was failing him, and his hand dropped limply to his side before it could find hers.

“Sari...” His voice was barely a breath now, his chest rising and falling in shallow gasps. “I’m... so sorry. I tried... I swear I tried.”

Sari’s breath hitched as she finally looked up, her tear-streaked face full of anguish. “Why are you giving up? Why are you just... letting go?” She shook her head, her hands trembling as she grabbed his hand, clutching it to her chest. “**Fight, damn it!** Fight for us!”

But there was no fight left in him. His eyes drifted closed again, his body sagging against the bed as the Pulse took more of him with each passing second.

“I can’t... I’m not strong enough...” His voice was barely audible, a whisper of regret that hung in the air like a weight. “I’m sorry... Sari... I... I love you.”

Sari’s heart shattered, the words she had longed to hear cutting deeper than she ever imagined. She gripped his hand tighter, her nails digging into his skin, but it was no use. Talon was slipping away.

“I love you too,” she whispered, her voice breaking as the last of her hope crumbled to dust. “I love you too...”

But as she sat there, clutching his hand to her chest, she knew. She’d lost him.

**Chapter 3: The Breaking Point**

The cabin was suffocating. The air seemed to press down on her, thick and heavy, as though the Pulse itself had seeped into the very walls. Sari sat beside Talon, her heart pounding in her chest as she watched his chest rise and fall in shallow, uneven breaths. The dark veins beneath his skin pulsed, alive with the rhythm of something dark and malevolent.

“**Talon...**” Her voice was a soft plea, barely more than a whisper. She gripped his hand, her fingers trembling as they traced the familiar contours of his knuckles. “**Please... stay with me.**”

Talon’s eyes fluttered, his chest heaving slightly as he struggled to respond. But the words didn’t come. His body was there, but he was slipping further away with every breath.

“No, no, no,” Sari muttered, shaking her head as tears welled in her eyes. “**You can’t leave me.** We’ve been through too much. You promised... **we can fight this.** I’ll do anything. **Anything.**” Her voice broke, but she pressed on, the words spilling from her in a desperate stream.

She leaned closer, her forehead nearly resting against his, her breath coming in short, ragged bursts. “**I’ll fix this. I’ll find a way.** I’ll do whatever it takes, just... **don’t go.**” Her grip tightened on his hand, her nails digging into his skin as though her touch could anchor him to this world.

But Talon didn’t respond. His breaths grew more labored, each one a painful gasp that echoed through the quiet cabin. The Pulse’s grip on him was tightening, its dark tendrils creeping further into him, suffocating what was left of his strength.

Sari’s heart twisted, her chest tight with panic. “No, no, no!” Her voice cracked as she pleaded, her eyes wild with desperation. “**I’ll do anything!** I’ll... I’ll give up everything if it means you’ll stay. **Please, Talon.**” Her voice dropped to a whisper, her breath hitching as she clutched his hand to her chest. “**Please... don’t leave me.**”

She waited, her body trembling, for any sign of life, any flicker of hope that he could still hear her. But there was nothing. His hand lay limp in hers, his body growing colder by the second.

Sari let out a strangled sob, her hands shaking as she gripped the edge of the bed. “We’ll figure it out, okay? We always do. **Just... hold on.**” Her voice cracked again, the rawness of her desperation cutting through the quiet.

But Talon’s breathing slowed, the black veins tightening around his neck, twisting their way up toward his face. His eyes fluttered open for a moment, the once-vibrant blue now dulled by the shadow of the Pulse. He looked at her, his gaze filled with something that broke her heart even further—**apology**.

“Sari...” His voice was barely a rasp, a ghost of the man she had loved for so long. “**I’m sorry.**”

Her chest tightened, her throat constricting as she shook her head furiously. “**No.** No, don’t you dare apologize. **You’re not leaving me.** You can’t... **I can’t...**” Her voice trailed off, caught between a sob and a scream as she clutched his hand tighter. “**Please, Talon.** You can fight this. **I know you can.**”

But even as she said the words, she could feel it—**the weight of inevitability** pressing down on her. Her mind screamed at her to keep fighting, to keep searching for a solution, but her heart... her heart knew the truth.

Her breathing hitched, the tears now falling freely as she brought his hand to her lips, pressing a kiss against his cold skin. “**I’ll fix it.** I’ll figure out how. I’ll find a way...” But her voice wavered, the promise already crumbling as she spoke it.

Talon’s chest rose and fell with a slow, painful breath. His eyes drifted closed again, his hand slipping from hers.

“No...” Sari whimpered, her voice broken. “**No, please... not yet.**” She dropped to her knees beside the bed, her hands clutching the edge as if she could somehow keep him tethered to her through sheer force of will.

But Talon’s body was still now, his breaths shallow, each one softer than the last.

Her mind raced, frantic for answers. **There has to be something.** There always was. They’d gotten through everything before. **There’s always a way out.**

“I’ll make a deal,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she stared at the ceiling, as though the Pulse itself could hear her. “**I’ll do anything. Take me instead. Just... let him go.**” The words tumbled out, raw and hopeless, as she waited for some response, for some shift that would bring him back to her.

But nothing came.

Her hands trembled as she pressed them against her face, her breath coming in ragged gasps. “**Why?**” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “**Why can’t I save him?**”

Talon’s eyes fluttered open again, though barely. His lips parted, and with what little strength he had left, he whispered, “Sari... **it’s not your fault.**”

His words hit her like a punch to the gut, the finality of it sinking in as she stared at him, wide-eyed. “No... **don’t say that.**” Her voice cracked as she gripped his hand again, her knuckles white from the force of it. “**I need you.** I can’t... I can’t lose you.”

Talon’s gaze softened, the barest hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. “It’s... okay,” he rasped, his voice barely audible. “You... **have to let me go.**”

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Sari’s chest tightened as she shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “**I can’t...**”

But deep down, she knew. She had known for some time now. The Pulse had taken too much of him. Holding onto him—**keeping him in this state**—was only prolonging his suffering.

Her breath came in shallow gasps, her mind racing with a thousand thoughts, a thousand promises she had made to herself. **She was supposed to save him**. She had promised him that.

But now, as she looked at him, at the pain in his eyes, she realized that the greatest act of love she could give him was to let him go.

Her chest heaved with sobs as she leaned down, pressing her forehead against his, her tears falling onto his skin. “**I love you, Talon.** I love you so much...”

Talon’s breath hitched, and for a moment, he seemed to stir, his hand twitching in hers. But then, with one last shuddering breath, his body went still.

Sari’s heart shattered.

For a long moment, she couldn’t move. She couldn’t breathe. The world seemed to close in around her, suffocating her with the weight of her grief.

But as she sat there, her forehead still resting against his, she felt it—**the moment of acceptance**. The moment when she realized that holding onto him would only destroy them both.

Her hands shook as she slowly pulled back, her eyes red and swollen from the tears. She looked down at him, at the peaceful expression on his face, and something inside her shifted.

It wasn’t just grief anymore. It was love. Pure, unfiltered love.

“Goodbye, Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling but full of resolve. “**I’ll never forget you.**”

And in that moment, as she finally let him go, she knew—**this was her final act of love.**
