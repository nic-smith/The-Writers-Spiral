### **Chapter 8: The New Arrival**

The fog had thickened, swirling like a living thing as Sari and Jack trudged forward. Every step felt heavier, like the air itself was conspiring against them. Sari’s mind raced with everything they had uncovered in the bunker—the government’s failed experiments, the lives consumed by the Pulse, and the horrifying knowledge that it was getting stronger.

Jack was silent, his focus sharp, but there was tension in his posture, as though he was processing far more than he let on. The two moved cautiously, the weight of the Pulse’s presence pressing down on them.

Suddenly, footsteps echoed through the mist, slow and deliberate. Sari froze, her breath catching in her throat. Jack tensed beside her, his hand instinctively reaching for the weapon at his side.

From the fog, a figure emerged—tall and composed, moving with an unsettling calm. As she drew closer, the woman’s face became clearer, framed by dark hair tied back in a tight knot. Her expression was cool, almost detached, though there was something in her eyes that flickered with dangerous intent.

“Elara Quinn,” she said before either of them could ask. Her voice was smooth, controlled, with a subtle undercurrent of amusement. “And you must be the ones snooping around in places you don’t belong.”

Jack’s eyes narrowed, but he said nothing, sizing her up. Sari felt a chill crawl up her spine. There was something about this woman—something **off**. She carried herself with the precision of someone who always had a plan, but there was a reckless glint in her eyes that made Sari wary.

“You knew about the bunker,” Jack said, his voice low, edged with suspicion.

Elara’s lips twitched into a small, humorless smile. “Of course I did. The question is, how much did you learn?” She crossed her arms, her posture casual but deliberate, like she was already three steps ahead of them.

Sari exchanged a quick glance with Jack. He kept his eyes on Elara, his stance tense but controlled. “Enough to know the government’s been screwing around with something they can’t control.”

Elara laughed, a soft, almost musical sound, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “You think that’s news? They’ve been trying to control things they don’t understand for decades. The Pulse just happens to be the latest in a long line of bad decisions.”

Her nonchalance sent a shiver down Sari’s spine. There was a coldness in Elara’s tone, an almost **casual disregard** for the lives lost to the Pulse. It was as if the devastation was just another interesting data point in her research.

Jack took a step forward, his gaze locked on her. “Why are you here, Quinn? And why should we trust you?”

Elara’s eyes gleamed, as if she found the question amusing. “Trust?” she echoed, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “That’s a dangerous word out here. Let’s just say I’m not here to help you out of the goodness of my heart.”

Sari felt her pulse quicken. “Then what do you want?”

Elara tilted her head slightly, as though considering her answer. “I want the same thing you do—to stop the Pulse. But unlike you two, I actually know what I’m doing.”

Her arrogance grated on Sari, but there was something in her tone that made it hard to ignore her. Elara wasn’t lying—she knew more about the Pulse than they did, and that knowledge made her dangerous.

“Let me guess,” Jack said, folding his arms across his chest. “You were part of the experiments.”

Elara’s smile widened, a predatory gleam in her eyes. “Oh, I was more than part of them. I led them.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. The woman in front of her was responsible for the experiments that had left entire towns erased, people consumed by the Pulse. And yet, here she was, calm and detached, as though the horror she’d unleashed was nothing more than a failed hypothesis.

“So, you’re the reason this thing is out of control,” Jack said coldly.

Elara shrugged, unbothered by the accusation. “Control is relative. The Pulse was never something we could ‘control.’ But we could study it, learn from it, use it.”

Jack’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening. “Use it? You’re out of your mind.”

Elara’s eyes sparkled with something close to amusement. “Perhaps. But that’s exactly why I’m still alive.”

Sari took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. “Why are you here now? If you’re so smart, why didn’t you stop the Pulse before it spread this far?”

Elara’s smile faded, her expression becoming more serious. “Because the Pulse has evolved. It’s no longer just an anomaly—it’s **feeding** on something. And if we don’t find out what that is, it’s going to keep getting stronger.”

Sari’s stomach churned at the word **feeding**. The thought of the Pulse growing stronger by consuming people—**Talon**—was almost too much to bear.

Jack glanced at the small device Elara was holding. “What’s that?”

Elara’s fingers brushed lightly over the surface of the device, a hint of pride in her voice. “It’s a tracker. Calibrated to follow the strongest energy signatures emitted by the Pulse. It’s been leading me here for days.”

“And what do you plan to do when we find the source?” Jack asked, his tone sharp.

Elara’s eyes gleamed. “I plan to end it. One way or another.”

Sari’s heart pounded as Elara’s words sunk in. She didn’t trust this woman—her motives were too cold, too calculated. But there was no denying that Elara knew more about the Pulse than anyone they’d encountered. If anyone had a shot at stopping it, it was her.

But at what cost?

“I don’t trust you,” Sari said, her voice trembling despite herself. “How do we know you’re not just using us to finish whatever twisted experiments you started?”

Elara’s gaze softened slightly, and for the briefest moment, Sari thought she saw something close to sincerity in her eyes. But it was fleeting, gone as quickly as it had come.

“You don’t know,” Elara said simply. “But you don’t have another choice.”

Sari’s hands clenched into fists. Elara was right, and that was what made it so infuriating. They needed her, whether they liked it or not.

Jack’s expression was unreadable, his mind clearly working through the implications of letting Elara guide them. After a long pause, he nodded slowly. “Fine. We’ll work together. But know this—if you screw us over, I’ll make sure you regret it.”

Elara’s smile returned, sharper this time, as though she found his threat amusing. “I wouldn’t dream of it, Jack.”

Sari shivered. There was something about the way Elara said his name—like she was already playing some game none of them could see.

### **Chapter 9: The Choice**

The fog felt heavier now, thick and clinging to every breath they took. The Pulse’s presence was no longer just a hum in the background—it was **everywhere**, warping the air around them, making the trees twist and bend unnaturally. Sari could feel it pressing down on her chest, her mind fraying at the edges as she struggled to keep herself grounded.

Jack moved with purpose, leading them through the forest with calculated strides. Elara followed closely, her expression calm, even bored, as if the Pulse was just another obstacle in her path. The silence between the three of them felt like a coiled snake, ready to strike.

Sari’s mind churned with everything that had happened—the discovery of the bunker, the truth about the Pulse, and now Elara’s cold, detached attitude toward the entire situation. It grated on her, fueling a fire she had been trying to keep at bay.

“How much longer are we going to keep running from this thing?” Sari finally asked, her voice sharp as she broke the silence.

Elara’s lips twitched into a smile, but there was no humor in it. “Running? Is that what you think we’re doing?” She glanced sideways at Sari, her tone dripping with condescension.

Sari’s jaw clenched. “You’ve been following the Pulse for months, haven’t you? And yet here we are—no closer to stopping it.”

Elara stopped walking, turning to face Sari fully. Her expression remained calm, but there was a flicker of something darker in her eyes. “Following, yes. Studying, learning. That’s how you get ahead in situations like this, not by rushing in blindly like some emotional wreck.”

The words hit Sari like a slap. She could feel the anger bubbling up inside her, a sharp, hot wave that made her chest tighten. “We’re not studying an animal, Elara. This thing is alive—it’s taking people, warping them, turning them into… into monsters. How can you be so calm about it?”

Elara raised an eyebrow, her gaze cool and calculating. “Because emotion clouds judgment. It makes you weak, vulnerable. If you want to stop the Pulse, you need to keep a clear head.”

Jack watched them in silence, his eyes darting between the two women, but he didn’t intervene. His silence felt like an acknowledgment that this moment had been coming for a while.

Sari stepped forward, her fists clenched at her sides. “A clear head? You’re willing to risk everything just to feed your obsession with studying this thing! How many people have died because you were too busy ‘learning’?”

Elara’s eyes flashed with irritation, but her voice remained controlled. “And how many more will die if we rush in unprepared, letting our emotions guide us? This isn’t about saving one person—this is about stopping something far bigger.”

Sari’s hands trembled with fury, her mind flashing back to Talon, his face warped by the Pulse’s influence. She couldn’t let that happen to him, not when there was still a chance to save him. But Elara… she didn’t care. All she saw was the **experiment**, not the lives at stake.

“You don’t care about saving anyone,” Sari spat, her voice trembling with anger. “You just want to understand the Pulse so you can control it. You’re just like the government—playing with forces you don’t understand, thinking you can bend them to your will.”

Elara’s lips curled into a smile, cold and sharp. “You’re right. I don’t care about your Talon or any other individual casualty. What I care about is winning. And the only way to win is to be smarter than the Pulse, to know its every move before it makes them.”

Sari’s chest tightened, her heart pounding in her ears. The words “individual casualty” echoed in her mind like a death sentence. Talon… a casualty. She couldn’t stand it.

“You’re sick,” Sari whispered, her voice low but laced with venom. “You think you’re so much better than everyone else because you don’t feel anything. But that’s what makes you dangerous. You don’t care who gets hurt as long as you get your answers.”

Elara took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. “You call it dangerous. I call it necessary. Emotion makes you reckless. If you want to survive this, you’ll have to learn to put those feelings aside.”

Before Sari could respond, Jack’s voice cut through the tension like a knife. “Enough.”

Both women turned to him, the air between them still crackling with unspoken animosity. Jack’s expression was hard, his gaze locked on Elara. “We’re not here to argue about methods. We’re here to decide what we do next.”

Elara scoffed, crossing her arms. “We don’t have a choice. The Pulse is feeding on something—or someone—and if we want to stop it, we have to find its source.”

Sari’s stomach churned at the thought. **Feeding on someone**. Talon… Could it be him? Could the Pulse be using him, warping him, feeding off his very existence? The thought made her sick, but it also solidified her resolve.

Jack nodded slowly. “She’s right. We’re running out of time. The Pulse is getting stronger. If we don’t stop it now, there won’t be anything left to save.”

Sari clenched her fists, her eyes locked on Elara. She hated to admit it, but Jack was right. As much as she despised Elara’s cold, clinical approach, they didn’t have any other options.

“So what’s the plan?” Sari asked, her voice tense.

Elara smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “We follow the tracker.” She held up the small device she had shown them earlier. “It’s synced to the Pulse’s strongest energy signature. If we follow it, it will lead us straight to the source.”

Sari felt a knot form in her stomach. “And what happens when we get there?”

Elara’s smile faded, her expression turning more serious. “We sever the connection. One way or another.”

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest. Sever the connection. The words hung in the air like a threat, heavy and ominous. Could they really do it? Could they stop the Pulse before it consumed everything?

Jack glanced at Sari, his expression unreadable. “We need to be ready for anything.”

Sari nodded, though her legs felt weak beneath her. She couldn’t stop thinking about Talon, about what might be waiting for them at the Pulse’s source. But she couldn’t turn back now. They had come too far.

Elara turned, her movements sharp and controlled. “We head out at first light. If we move fast, we can reach the Pulse’s core by tomorrow evening.”

Sari watched her walk away, her hands trembling with a mix of anger and fear. She hated Elara. Hated the way she spoke about all of this like it was some sort of game, like the lives they were risking didn’t matter.

But she hated the Pulse even more. And if following Elara was the only way to stop it, then she would do it.

No matter the cost.

### **Chapter 10: The Confrontation**

The fog thickened as dawn broke, the light filtering through the twisted trees in pale, sickly rays. The forest felt different now, as if the Pulse had drawn every bit of life from it, leaving only shadows in its wake. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as they moved deeper into the forest, every step bringing them closer to the Pulse’s core.

Jack led the way, his steps precise, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of danger. Elara followed closely behind, her movements sharp and focused, her gaze fixed on the tracker in her hand. The device pulsed with a steady, rhythmic hum, synced to the Pulse’s energy signature. Sari trailed behind them, her legs heavy with exhaustion, but her mind racing with thoughts of Talon. 

Was he still out there? Was he lost to the Pulse, or could they still save him?

“We’re getting close,” Elara said, her voice breaking the silence. Her eyes gleamed with something that sent a shiver down Sari’s spine—anticipation.

Sari clenched her fists. She couldn’t stand the way Elara looked at all of this—like it was some kind of challenge to be conquered, another experiment to prove her superiority. But Jack was right: they didn’t have a choice. If they wanted to stop the Pulse, they needed Elara’s knowledge.

The tracker’s hum grew louder, more insistent, and Jack slowed his pace, signaling for them to stop. He turned to Elara, his expression hard. “How much farther?”

Elara glanced at the device, her eyes narrowing. “Not far. Maybe a hundred yards, just past that ridge.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat as she looked ahead. The trees thinned in the distance, giving way to a clearing. The air felt thicker here, heavy with the Pulse’s presence. She could feel it pressing against her mind, warping her thoughts, making it harder to focus.

“This is it,” Jack said, his voice tense. “Whatever’s out there… we’re about to face it.”

Elara smiled, a cold, calculated expression. “Good. It’s time to finish this.”

Sari swallowed hard, her heart racing. She could feel the weight of the moment pressing down on her. This was it. This was what they had been fighting for—the chance to stop the Pulse. But the fear gnawed at her, the uncertainty of what they were about to face.

As they moved closer to the clearing, the ground beneath their feet began to tremble. The rhythmic pulse that had been a constant hum in the background now grew louder, vibrating through the earth like a heartbeat. The trees around them creaked and groaned, their branches twisting in unnatural ways.

And then they saw it.

The Pulse had taken shape.

In the center of the clearing stood an enormous, twisting mass of dark, pulsing energy. It seemed to defy logic, warping the very air around it, distorting reality itself. The ground trembled with its power, and the trees bent toward it as if drawn by some invisible force.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. The Pulse wasn’t just an anomaly—it was alive. It was a **presence**, something far more terrifying than she had imagined. It wasn’t just warping the world—it was **consuming** it.

Jack’s hand tightened around the hilt of his weapon, his eyes narrowing as he studied the Pulse. “That’s it. That’s what we’ve been chasing.”

Elara’s eyes gleamed with something close to hunger. “We’re here.”

Sari’s stomach churned. The Pulse wasn’t just a force of nature—it was sentient. It **knew** they were there. She could feel its awareness pressing down on her, probing her thoughts, her memories. She staggered back, her mind reeling.

And then she heard it.

**Talon.**

His voice was faint, distorted, but it was him. Sari’s heart lurched as she stumbled forward, her eyes searching the clearing for any sign of him. “Talon!” she called out, her voice breaking with desperation.

Elara glanced at her, a flicker of irritation crossing her face. “Focus, Sari. We don’t have time for this.”

But Sari couldn’t stop. She moved closer to the Pulse, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. **Talon was here**—she could feel him, could hear him calling her name.

Jack grabbed her arm, pulling her back. “It’s not him. It’s the Pulse. It’s messing with your head.”

Sari shook her head, tears filling her eyes. “No, he’s here. I know he is.”

Elara stepped forward, her eyes locked on the Pulse. “It’s feeding off him. It’s using his energy to grow stronger. If we sever the connection, he’ll be gone.”

Sari’s heart shattered. “What do you mean, gone?”

Elara’s gaze was cold, unfeeling. “If we destroy the Pulse, there’s no saving him. He’s part of it now.”

Sari’s legs gave way beneath her, and she fell to her knees, her mind spinning. Talon… gone? After everything, after coming this far, she couldn’t lose him. Not now.

Jack crouched beside her, his voice low. “Sari, listen to me. We need to end this. If we don’t stop the Pulse, more people will die. Talon wouldn’t want that.”

Sari’s breath hitched, tears streaming down her face. She knew Jack was right, but the thought of losing Talon—of letting him go—was too much to bear.

Elara stepped closer to the Pulse, the tracker in her hand pulsing in time with the energy around them. “We don’t have time for this. Make a decision.”

Sari’s hands shook as she looked up at the Pulse, its energy swirling in dark, violent waves. Talon was in there, somewhere, trapped in the Pulse’s grasp. But if they didn’t stop it now, the Pulse would continue to spread, consuming everything in its path.

She had to choose.

“Please,” Sari whispered, her voice breaking. “There has to be another way.”

Elara’s expression hardened. “There isn’t. The Pulse has taken him. There’s no bringing him back. The only thing we can do now is stop it.”

Jack’s hand rested on Sari’s shoulder, his voice soft but firm. “We have to do this, Sari. For everyone else.”

Sari’s chest tightened, the weight of the decision pressing down on her like a vice. She had come so far, fought so hard to find Talon. But now… now she had to let him go. She had to stop the Pulse, no matter the cost.

With trembling hands, she stood, her legs weak beneath her. She wiped the tears from her eyes and nodded.

“Do it,” she whispered.

Elara didn’t hesitate. She raised the tracker, syncing it to the Pulse’s energy signature. The device hummed, pulsing with the same rhythm as the Pulse, and then—suddenly—there was a high-pitched whine, followed by a sharp, blinding flash of light.

The Pulse screamed.

The sound was deafening, a high-pitched wail that tore through the air, shaking the ground beneath their feet. The Pulse writhed, its energy warping and twisting as the connection was severed. The ground cracked, fissures spreading through the earth as the Pulse’s power was torn apart.

Sari fell to her knees again, clutching her chest as the sound reverberated through her body. Her mind was filled with the Pulse’s final moments, its pain, its rage, its fear. And then… silence.

The clearing was still. The Pulse was gone.

Sari’s heart ached, her body trembling with exhaustion. Talon was gone. She had lost him, and there was nothing she could do to bring him back.

Elara lowered the tracker, her expression unreadable. “It’s done.”

Jack stood in silence, his gaze fixed on the spot where the Pulse had been. “Is it over?”

Elara nodded. “For now. But this isn’t the end. The Pulse… it’s not something you can just destroy. It will come back. It always does.”

Sari’s chest tightened, her breath shallow. She had done what needed to be done, but the cost… the cost was too high.
