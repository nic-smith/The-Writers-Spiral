**Preface**

The fog wrapped around Sari like a living thing, thick and cold, clinging to her skin with each breath. She could feel it pushing against her, heavy, as though it wanted to swallow her whole. The air was so damp it felt like it was soaking into her bones, pulling her deeper into the pulse of the earth, into the heart of this twisted forest.

Everywhere she looked, the trees stretched up into the murky sky, their branches twisted and warped, contorting in ways that made her stomach turn. Shadows shifted in the corners of her vision, but whenever she looked directly at them, they were gone. Her mind couldn’t trust what her eyes were telling her anymore. 

Her foot caught on a root, and she stumbled, barely catching herself before she hit the ground. The weight of the fog, the trees, the Pulse—it was all pressing down on her, making it hard to move, hard to think. She could feel it—**the Pulse, creeping at the edges of her mind, whispering things she didn’t want to hear**.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice swallowed by the fog. Her heart clenched at the name. He was out there, somewhere, but the Pulse had him now. She wasn’t sure how much of him was left.

She forced herself forward, each step harder than the last. Her breath came in sharp, shallow bursts, her chest tightening as the cold air gnawed at her lungs. The forest closed in around her, the trees twisting into shapes that looked almost human, as though they were watching her, mocking her. 

The memories hit her without warning—sharp and vivid. **Talon’s laugh**, clear and bright, echoed in her ears, so real she could almost believe he was there with her. He was pushing her in that rusted wheelbarrow, her arms flung out to the sides as she screamed in delight. **Hold on tight, Sari!** His voice was so full of life, so full of warmth. She had laughed until she couldn’t breathe, the golden sun turning the wildflowers into a blur of color.

But then, as quickly as it had come, the memory twisted, darkened. **His laugh warped, distorting into something monstrous**, echoing through the trees, bouncing back at her from every direction. The world around her seemed to shift and tremble, the trees bending at impossible angles, their branches clawing toward the sky.

She clenched her fists, trying to block it out, trying to hold on to the memory before it was twisted beyond recognition. But the Pulse wouldn’t let her. It was taking everything—Talon, the cabin, their dreams—and turning it into something unrecognizable, something broken.

She stumbled forward, her hands brushing against a tree for balance. Its bark felt slick and wrong beneath her fingers, as if the Pulse had infected the wood itself, making it soft and pliable. She pulled her hand away, heart racing.

The memory of **the cabin** surfaced in her mind, clearer than the distorted world around her. **Their cabin, tucked away in the mountains**, with its wide windows and warm wooden beams. Talon had drawn it with such precision—**every line exact**, every detail perfect. They had planned to build it together, to make it their refuge from the chaos of the world. A place where they could **live, dream, and create**. 

Now, the cabin was nothing more than a ruin in her mind, the windows shattered, the walls crumbling. The dream had been devoured by the Pulse, just like everything else. 

Sari’s heart ached as she moved through the fog, her footsteps heavy, her legs burning with the effort. The Pulse was pulling her in, dragging her down, its invisible fingers tightening around her chest, pressing harder with each step.

From the depths of the forest, **she heard something**—a sound that made her blood run cold. It was Talon’s voice again, but this time it was **warped, twisted**, almost unrecognizable. Her name echoed through the trees, slithering through the fog like a snake. 

“Sari… Sari…”

Her breath hitched in her throat. It wasn’t him. It couldn’t be. But still, she turned her head, searching for him through the fog, hoping against all logic that he was there.

But the forest whispered back, mocking her hope: *He’s gone. You’re alone.*

She pressed on, her body trembling from cold and fear, her mind battling the memories and the reality in front of her. **The cabin**, once their shared dream, stood now as a monument to her failure, a broken ruin lost to the Pulse.

Her hand reached instinctively into her pocket, closing around something soft—the **teddy bear**. It was worn, its fabric frayed from years of being held, of being kept close. Talon had cherished it once. Now it was all she had left of him. She clutched it tightly, her only anchor to what was real, what hadn’t yet been destroyed by the Pulse. 

But even as she held it, the world around her began to blur, the fog thickening, **the Pulse creeping deeper into her mind**, warping her memories, twisting her sense of time. The trees groaned, their branches curling, bending toward her like outstretched fingers, as though they too wanted to take her.

The Pulse was winning.

And she wasn’t sure how much longer she could hold on.

**Chapter 1: The Chase**

Sari pushed forward through the forest, her footsteps uneven as the ground seemed to shift beneath her. The fog was heavier here, thicker, wrapping around her like a living thing. Every breath she took was cold, each inhale sharp and painful as though the fog itself was seeping into her lungs.

The trees loomed above her, their branches twisted and clawing at the sky, dark and warped. **Everything here felt wrong**. The forest had once been alive—full of light and color—but now, it was as if the Pulse had sucked all the life from it, leaving only a twisted version of what had been.

Sari’s heart raced as she stumbled forward, the weight of the Pulse pressing against her mind, whispering things she didn’t want to hear. She tried to block it out, tried to focus on **finding Talon**, but the Pulse was relentless, invading every corner of her thoughts.

Her legs ached, each step heavier than the last, as though the ground was pulling her down, trying to drag her deeper into the earth. Her lungs burned, and her body felt like it was moving through water, every movement slow and labored. 

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice weak, barely audible in the suffocating fog. She didn’t know if he could hear her, if he was even still out there, but she had to keep going. She had to find him.

The Pulse twisted the landscape around her, warping the trees and making the shadows flicker at the edges of her vision. She couldn’t tell if the ground was stable or if it was shifting beneath her feet. Every time she looked, the world seemed to be moving—changing.

The **memories came in fragments**, unbidden and uncontrollable.

---

**Talon’s laugh** echoed in her ears, sharp and clear, cutting through the oppressive fog. She could see him, so vividly, pushing her in that rusted wheelbarrow through the field of wildflowers. The sun had been bright, the flowers a blur of color as they had raced through the field. **Hold on tight, Sari!** he had called, his voice full of joy, full of life.

Her heart had soared that day, her world had felt so light, so free.

But now, that world was gone.

The memory twisted in her mind, **his laughter warping into something dark, something monstrous**, as though the Pulse had reached into her past and twisted even her memories of him. The warm sunlight of that day was replaced by the cold, suffocating fog of the present, the joy she had felt swallowed by the ever-growing weight of her fear.

---

Sari shook her head, trying to force the memory away, but it clung to her, lingering at the edges of her thoughts like the fog around her. **The Pulse was doing this to her. It was twisting everything**, corrupting her memories, making her doubt what was real and what wasn’t.

Her footsteps faltered as she stumbled on a gnarled root, her body crashing to the ground. The cold mud soaked into her skin, chilling her to the bone. She stayed there for a moment, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she tried to collect herself, tried to push the Pulse’s whispers out of her mind.

But the forest was alive with the sound of the Pulse—**a low, rhythmic thrum** that seemed to vibrate through the trees, through the ground, through her. It was everywhere, in everything, and she couldn’t escape it.

*He’s gone. You’re alone.* The words echoed in her mind, a voice that didn’t belong to her.

No, she wouldn’t believe it. Talon was still out there. He had to be.

Sari forced herself to her feet, her legs trembling from the effort. She had to keep moving. She couldn’t let the Pulse take her too.

---

The fog swirled around her, thickening, as though it were alive, bending the trees into unnatural shapes. **The forest was wrong**—the angles of the branches, the shadows that seemed to move on their own. The Pulse had twisted it all, and as she moved deeper into the woods, Sari felt the presence of the Pulse more keenly, as if it were wrapping itself around her mind.

Her hand instinctively moved to her pocket, where the small **teddy bear** rested. The fabric was worn and frayed, its once-soft fur now rough and matted. She clutched it tightly, her fingers trembling. Talon had kept it for so long, and now it was all she had left of him. It grounded her, kept her anchored in the chaos of the world around her. 

“Talon,” she whispered again, this time louder, her voice breaking as she fought against the thickening fog. **She had to find him before the Pulse took him completely.**

The forest groaned in response, the trees creaking as they bent and twisted in unnatural ways. The ground seemed to ripple beneath her feet, the Pulse distorting everything—**even time itself** felt like it was slipping away from her, falling apart.

---

**She remembered the cabin**, nestled in the mountains, so clear in her mind despite the decay of the world around her. Talon had designed it with such care, every line perfect, every detail thoughtful. It was their dream, their future. A place where they could escape, where they could live and create. The cabin was supposed to be their sanctuary, their safe haven from the chaos of the world.

But that future was gone now. The Pulse had taken it all.

---

Her heart pounded in her chest as she heard something—a faint sound in the distance. It was **Talon’s voice**. She stopped, her breath catching in her throat, her heart racing. Was it really him? Or was it just another trick of the Pulse?

She couldn’t tell. The Pulse had twisted her mind so much that she didn’t know what was real anymore.

But she had to believe. She had to hope that it was him.

Sari took a step forward, then another, her feet dragging through the mud as she moved toward the sound. **Talon’s voice** echoed through the trees again, but this time it was wrong—distorted, warped, as though the Pulse had twisted even his voice.

“Sari...” His voice slithered through the fog, soft and menacing. 

Her heart clenched. No. This wasn’t him. It couldn’t be.

---

She kept moving, her steps quickening, her mind racing as the Pulse whispered in her ear, pulling at her memories, distorting her thoughts. She tried to block it out, tried to focus on finding Talon, but the Pulse was too strong. 

*He’s gone. You’re alone.*

The voice echoed again, louder this time, and Sari felt a cold shiver run down her spine. She wasn’t sure if it was the Pulse or her own fears creeping into her mind. But she couldn’t stop. She had to keep moving.

The fog thickened around her, and the forest became even more twisted, the trees bending and contorting like something out of a nightmare. The ground shifted beneath her feet, and for a moment, she thought she would fall again, but she forced herself to stay upright, to keep moving forward.

“Talon!” she called out, louder now, her voice breaking with desperation. She couldn’t lose him. Not again.

The Pulse thrummed in response, its presence pressing against her mind, suffocating her thoughts, making her question everything. 

But she wouldn’t stop. She couldn’t. Talon was out there, somewhere. He had to be.

Here’s **Chapter 2** rewritten based on the feedback and enhancements discussed. This version focuses on the emotional depth between **Sari and Talon**, the **psychological effects of the Pulse**, and the **symbolism of the cabin**. The goal is to amplify the tension in their reunion, with the cabin acting as both a reminder of their shared dreams and a physical manifestation of the Pulse’s corruption.

---

**Chapter 2: The Cabin**

"Talon!" Sari’s voice cracked as she stumbled toward the cabin, her breath coming in ragged bursts. The forest had swallowed her whole, and now, even as she stood at the rotting threshold of the place they once called a refuge, it felt like the last breath of a dream long gone.

The cabin—**their cabin**—was broken. Just like him.

The walls sagged inward, the wood warped as though it had been **twisted by unseen hands**. The windows, once brimming with sunlight, were shattered, the glass scattered across the floor like splinters of lost hope. **Decay hung in the air**, a stench of rot and something darker—something alive. The Pulse.

She felt it. **Everywhere**. It wasn’t just inside the cabin—it was inside her, creeping into the edges of her mind, feeding on her doubts, her fear. It whispered to her with every breath she took. *Too late.*

Sari’s heart pounded, her hands trembling as she stepped inside. The air was thick, pressing down on her like a weight she couldn’t shake. Every creak of the floorboards echoed through the empty room, making her flinch. This place had once been their haven. Now, it was a tomb.

But **Talon was here**. He had to be.

“Please, Talon,” she whispered, her voice barely audible as she moved deeper into the room. “I’m here. I came back for you.”

Her fingers grazed the remnants of the wooden doorframe, the splinters catching at her skin. She ignored the pain. Nothing else mattered. **Talon was what mattered**.

And then she saw him.

He stood by the shattered window, his back to her. For a moment, hope surged through her chest—he was still standing, still here. But something was wrong. His silhouette wavered, as though the air around him was alive, warping, distorting his form.

"Talon," she whispered, taking a step forward. **He didn’t move**.

Her heart raced, pounding so loudly in her ears that it drowned out the creaking cabin. She took another step, and then another, reaching out with trembling fingers. "Talon..."

Slowly, he turned to face her, and the world seemed to stop.

His face—**the face she had loved**—was gone. **Black veins twisted beneath his skin**, crawling like a living thing. His eyes were dark, hollow, **swallowed by the Pulse**. There was no light left in them, no recognition. 

“Talon...” Her voice broke, barely a whisper now.

She moved closer, unable to stop herself, her hand reaching for him. **He couldn’t be gone**. Not like this. But as her fingers brushed against his arm, he recoiled violently, his body jerking away as if her touch burned him.

“Talon, please,” she begged, her voice cracking with desperation. **“I know you’re still in there. You can fight this.”**

But as she looked at him, her heart sank. **The man she had known was gone**. The Pulse had taken him—twisted him into something unrecognizable. The veins beneath his skin pulsed, black and malevolent, spreading further, reaching toward his neck.

She gripped his arm tighter, refusing to let go, but as she did, **a sliver of doubt crept in**. Was she doing this for him—or for herself? Was she holding onto the past because she couldn’t bear the thought of facing the future alone? **What if she was making it worse?**

Her breath caught in her throat, tears welling in her eyes. “Please, Talon,” she whispered, “come back to me.”

For a moment—just a moment—his eyes flickered. The darkness receded, and **there he was**. Talon. **Her Talon**. His lips parted as if to speak, and she could see him fighting, trying to break through the Pulse’s hold.

Her heart leapt. “Talon! I’m here! I’m with you.”

But then the moment shattered.

**The Pulse surged**.

Talon’s body convulsed violently, his back arching as the black veins twisted tighter, wrapping around him like chains. His limbs jerked, and a low, primal scream tore from his throat. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the floor, the Pulse tightening its grip on him with every second.

“No!” Sari screamed, dropping to her knees beside him. “Talon, **fight it!**”

She grabbed his hand, but it was ice cold. **He wasn’t there anymore**.

---

The Pulse was everywhere now, filling the room like a living, breathing entity. It wasn’t just taking Talon—it was coming for her too.

A dark tendril of blackness snaked through the air, slithering toward her. Sari barely managed to pull away before it brushed her arm, but she could feel the chill of it, **the hunger**, as it reached for her.

*You’re too late*, the Pulse whispered, its voice curling through her mind like poison. *He’s gone. And soon, you will be too.*

Sari gasped, her breath coming in short, panicked bursts as she watched the blackness spread further through Talon’s body. His limbs twitched, his chest heaving with ragged breaths, but he was slipping away—**fading** before her eyes.

Her hands shook as she clutched him tighter. **What was she doing?** Was she really trying to save him—or was she just holding onto a memory? A part of her, deep down, whispered that maybe she should let him go. Maybe he was already lost.

But she couldn’t. **Not yet.**

With a cry of desperation, she gripped his arm harder, her voice trembling. “I won’t lose you. **Not like this.**”

But the Pulse was winning. The cabin groaned around them, the walls trembling as cracks splintered through the wood. **It was all falling apart**.

Sari’s mind raced. **What could she do?** If she stayed, the Pulse would take her too. But if she left... she couldn’t leave him behind. **Not after everything**.

The Pulse’s tendrils wrapped tighter around Talon’s body, pulling him deeper, faster. His chest convulsed, his limbs jerking violently as the veins twisted further, consuming him.

“Talon...” Her voice was barely more than a breath, her heart breaking. She couldn’t let him go. She couldn’t. But as she looked at him, her hand trembling against his cold skin, the doubt gnawed at her. **Was it him anymore?**

She had to make a choice.

---

The cabin groaned again, louder this time, the floor beneath them splintering as the Pulse’s darkness seeped through the cracks, curling toward her. **Time was running out**.

Sari’s breath came in short, panicked bursts as she looked down at Talon’s still form. His body was limp now, his eyes closed, the veins pulsing beneath his skin. **The Pulse had him**.

But as she held him, something flickered—**a twitch**. His hand moved, barely perceptible, but it was there.

Her heart leapt in her chest. “Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling with hope. “Can you hear me?”

For a moment, his eyelids fluttered, and his lips parted. His voice was faint, barely a breath, but it was him. **“Sari...”**

Her tears fell freely now, her heart pounding in her chest. **He was still in there**.

“I’m here,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m right here. Don’t leave me. Please, don’t leave me.”

But just as quickly as the moment had come, it was gone. Talon’s body jerked violently, the Pulse surging again, the veins tightening their grip. His eyes rolled back, and his body convulsed, the darkness consuming him once more.

Sari’s heart broke. **She couldn’t lose him. Not again.**

With one last burst of strength, she pulled him into her arms, his body heavy and limp. Her muscles screamed in protest, her lungs burning with every breath, but she didn’t stop. **She couldn’t stop**.

The Pulse howled, its dark tendrils reaching out, but Sari pushed forward, her heart racing, her mind screaming. **She wasn’t going to let it take him.**

Not now. **Not ever.**

---

**Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

“Wake up, damn it!” Sari’s voice was raw, breaking the suffocating silence that hung over the cabin like a shroud. She shook Talon’s lifeless form, her fingers digging into his cold skin. Her heart hammered in her chest, each beat slower, heavier—**more final**.

**He couldn’t be gone**. Not now. Not like this.

Her breath hitched as she pulled him closer, pressing her forehead against his. His skin was icy, his body limp in her arms, but she refused to believe it. **There had to be something left.**

“Talon... please,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “You have to come back. **You promised me**. You said we’d get through this.”

But the only response was the groaning of the cabin as the walls buckled under the weight of the Pulse’s dark influence. **Everything was collapsing**, the cabin, Talon, their future—it was all crumbling around her, slipping through her fingers like sand.

The Pulse pressed in from every direction, suffocating the air with its presence, its whispers threading through her mind like poison. *He’s gone, Sari. You’re too late.*

She shook her head, her tears falling onto his chest. “No,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “I won’t lose you. **I can’t lose you.**”

Her fingers grazed his cheek, and for a second—a fleeting second—she thought she felt a spark of warmth beneath his skin. Her breath caught in her throat, hope surging through her chest.

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. “Are you still there?”

His body twitched.

Sari froze, her heart pounding, disbelief flooding her veins. **No. It couldn’t be.** She held her breath, watching his face, her hands trembling as she cradled him. But then his chest rose—just slightly—and his lips parted.

“Sari...” The word was faint, broken, but it was him. **It was really him.**

Her heart leapt. “I’m here,” she whispered, choking on her tears. “I’m right here. Please, Talon, fight it. **Come back to me.**”

For a moment, his eyes fluttered open, and she saw him—**really saw him**. The darkness in his eyes had receded, the black veins pulsing beneath his skin seemed to fade. He looked at her, weak, fragile, but **alive**.

“I...” His voice cracked, his breath ragged, but his gaze stayed fixed on hers. “There’s a way, Sari... a way to stop this.”

Her hands tightened around his, her heart pounding in her chest. “Tell me,” she whispered. “Please, just tell me. What do I have to do?”

But before he could answer, his body convulsed violently, his limbs jerking as the black veins surged back, tightening their grip. His eyes rolled back, and the Pulse **snapped him back into its grasp**.

“No!” Sari screamed, grabbing his shoulders as he writhed in her arms. “Talon, **don’t let go!**”

But the Pulse wasn’t finished. The darkness twisted around him, pulling him deeper, faster. His body shook with violent spasms, his breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps as the veins consumed him again.

Sari’s heart raced, panic clawing at her chest. **What was she supposed to do?** Talon had told her there was a way—a way to stop it. But now, his voice was gone, swallowed by the Pulse’s insidious grasp. The cabin trembled around them, the walls cracking and groaning as if the Pulse was pulling it apart piece by piece.

And then she felt it—**the Pulse reaching for her**.

A tendril of darkness snaked through the air, curling around her wrist, its cold touch sending a shock of pain up her arm. She gasped, recoiling, but the Pulse tightened its grip, its voice slithering through her mind. *You can’t save him. You’ve already lost.*

“No,” Sari whispered, pulling against the Pulse’s hold, but it was like fighting a current, dragging her deeper into its darkness. **It wasn’t just taking him—it was taking her too**. She could feel it now, creeping into her thoughts, whispering her doubts back to her, feeding on her fear.

Her lungs burned as she fought against it, her mind racing. **If she stayed, it would take her too**. The Pulse wouldn’t stop until it consumed everything—her, Talon, the cabin—everything they had built, everything they had loved.

But she couldn’t leave him. **Not like this**.

Her hands trembled as she gripped Talon tighter, her tears falling onto his skin. “Talon... I need you,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Please, come back to me. I can’t do this without you.”

The Pulse tightened its grip around her wrist, pulling her down, **closer to the edge**. Her vision blurred, her strength fading, but she refused to let go. **She wouldn’t lose him again**.

But as she looked at him—his body convulsing, the black veins crawling further up his neck—**the doubt crept in again**. Was she holding onto something that wasn’t there anymore? Was she fighting a battle she had already lost?

Her breath hitched, her mind screaming at her to run, to save herself, but she couldn’t. **She couldn’t leave him**.

Suddenly, Talon’s body jerked again, his back arching as the Pulse surged one final time. His eyes snapped open, and for a moment—just for a moment—they were clear again.

“Sari...” His voice was weak, barely audible, but it was him. **It was still him**.

Her heart shattered at the sound of his voice, but before she could speak, the Pulse tightened its grip, and Talon’s body went limp in her arms.

“No...” Sari whispered, her breath coming in shallow bursts. “No, no, no...”

The cabin groaned louder now, the floor beneath them splintering, the walls cracking as the Pulse’s influence consumed everything. **It was all falling apart**.

Sari’s chest tightened, her breath catching in her throat. **What was she supposed to do?** She couldn’t stay here—the Pulse was too strong. But she couldn’t leave him. **Not like this**.

*Let him go, Sari.* The Pulse’s voice slithered through her mind, cold and cruel. *You can’t save him. You’ve already lost him. Let him go.*

Her hands shook, her tears falling freely now as she cradled Talon’s lifeless form. “I won’t lose you,” she whispered, her voice breaking. **But even as she said the words, she knew—they were a lie.**

The Pulse was right. She had already lost him. **Talon was gone**.

---

But then—**something shifted**.

Talon’s fingers twitched in her grasp, barely perceptible, but it was enough. Her breath caught in her throat as she looked down at him, her heart pounding. **Could it be?**

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Can you hear me?”

For a moment, nothing happened. But then his chest rose—just slightly—and his eyes fluttered open once more. His gaze locked on hers, weak, fragile, but **real**.

“Sari...” His voice was broken, but it was him. **It was really him.**

Her tears fell faster, her heart racing as she held him tighter. “I’m here,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m not leaving you. **I’ll never leave you.**”

But the Pulse wasn’t finished. The darkness twisted around his body, pulling him deeper, tightening its grip on both of them. The cabin groaned, the walls shuddering as cracks splintered through the foundation. **Time was running out**.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she looked down at Talon. **She had to make a choice**. If she stayed, the Pulse would take them both. But if she left... if she left, Talon would be lost forever.

Her hands shook as she cradled his face, her tears blurring her vision. “Talon... what do I do?” she whispered, her voice breaking. **“Tell me what to do.”**

His eyes fluttered open one last time, and his lips parted. “You have to... let go.”

Her breath caught in her throat, her heart breaking at his words. **Let go?** How could she let him go? How could she leave him behind after everything they had been through?

But as she looked into his eyes, she knew. **He was right**.

With one last, shuddering breath, she pulled him into her arms, her body trembling with the effort. **She wasn’t ready to let go—but she had to.**

“I love you,” she whispered, her tears falling onto his skin. “I’ll always love you.”

And then, with one final

, agonizing cry, she released him, letting his body slip from her grasp as the Pulse consumed him, pulling him deeper into the darkness.

The cabin groaned one last time, the walls shattering as the Pulse’s influence spread further, **collapsing the world around her**. Sari’s breath came in short, ragged bursts as she stumbled toward the door, her heart breaking with every step. But she didn’t stop. **She couldn’t stop**.

The Pulse howled behind her, but Sari pushed forward, her tears blinding her as she ran. **She wasn’t going to let it take her too**.

Not now. **Not ever**.
