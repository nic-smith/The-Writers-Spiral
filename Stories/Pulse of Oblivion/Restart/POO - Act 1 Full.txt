**Preface: Echoes of the Past**

The forest loomed like a ghostly sentinel, its fog weaving through the trees and wrapping around Sari like a shroud. Each step felt heavy as she wandered deeper into the mist, haunted by the memories of Talon that clawed at her heart. The world around her faded, leaving only the echo of his laughter and the warmth of his presence.

“*Talon,*” she whispered, the name escaping her lips like a prayer. Memories flooded her mind—*the wheelbarrow ride on a sunlit afternoon, laughter bubbling between them like a gentle stream.* She could still feel the way he had tipped it ever so slightly, sending her into a fit of giggles as they careened through the wildflowers. That moment had captured their innocence, a fleeting sense of playfulness they both longed for.

But now, the fog felt oppressive, a constant reminder of the Pulse that had infiltrated their lives. Its tendrils were like dark whispers, creeping into her thoughts, amplifying her **anxiety** with every step. *What if I lose him forever?* The thought sent a shiver down her spine, yet her **willpower** surged to the forefront, urging her to fight.

Sari pressed on, fighting against the suffocating weight of the Pulse. As she trudged through the damp earth, the memories of their shared dreams emerged—*the cabin they had envisioned together, a sanctuary where they could build their lives free from chaos.* The image of its sturdy walls filled her with a sense of resilience, a beacon in the storm of despair.

Suddenly, a wave of physical symptoms hit her: her heart raced, and her breath quickened, each pulse of her heart resonating with the whispers of the Pulse. *It’s coming for you, Sari.* The thoughts churned in her mind like a tempest, almost overwhelming her. In that moment, she faltered, the weight of despair pressing down on her. 

*What if I can’t save him?* The thought struck hard, cutting through her resolve like a knife. She felt herself teetering on the edge, the darkness beckoning her to succumb. 

“*No!*” Sari shouted, her voice breaking through the fog, a fierce declaration against the onslaught. “I won’t let you take me!” 

Her determination surged, fueled by the memories of their laughter and shared dreams. She remembered the joy in Talon’s eyes as they sketched plans for the cabin, dreams woven into every line. *I need to find him,* she thought, drawing strength from the vision of their future.

As the whispers intensified, Sari waged a fierce internal battle. *Hope and self-doubt clashed like titans within her,* each trying to gain control. She closed her eyes, picturing Talon’s face, the love that shone through even in their darkest moments.

*I won’t give up on you, Talon. I’ll fight for us.* With renewed purpose, she pushed forward, ready to confront whatever lay ahead.

**Chapter 1: The Chase**

Sari pushed through the dense underbrush, her heart pounding in sync with her frantic thoughts. Each step felt heavy, weighted by the oppressive fog that clung to the forest like a suffocating blanket. The whispers of the Pulse echoed in her mind, twisting her reality and leaving her with a sense of urgency that pushed her forward. 

“Talon!” she called, her voice breaking through the silence, swallowed almost immediately by the fog. It was both a plea and a prayer, reverberating through the trees that loomed like ancient sentinels. With every echo, her heart ached with longing, fear mingling with hope.

*Where are you?* The thought clawed at her, a visceral reminder of what was at stake. Memories of their shared childhood flashed before her eyes—moments of joy and innocence that felt so far removed from her current reality. She could picture them racing through these very woods, laughing as they took turns in the old wheelbarrow. The thrill of speed and the wind in their hair had been intoxicating, and for that brief moment, they were invincible.

*Focus, Sari,* she reminded herself, shaking off the nostalgia. *He needs you now.*

Suddenly, a sharp pain coursed through her, the Pulse reaching out with its tendrils, creeping along her skin like icy fingers. Black veins spread across her arms, and she stumbled, gasping for breath. *Not now! I won’t let you take me!*

Drawing strength from the memories of Talon’s laughter, she straightened, wiping the sweat from her brow. *You have to keep going,* she told herself, envisioning the cabin they had dreamed of building together. Its walls would stand strong against any storm, a symbol of their resilience and love.

As she pressed on, the fog thickened, distorting her surroundings. Shadows danced in the corners of her vision, whispering promises of despair. *Don’t listen,* she chided herself. *You’re stronger than this.*

Every rustle of leaves and snap of twigs sent her heart racing. But there was no time for fear. She could feel it—Talon was close. The connection between them was palpable, like an invisible thread pulling her toward him.

Sari's thoughts flickered to a time when they had built a fort during a summer storm, barricading themselves with blankets and laughter. They had whispered secrets, their dreams spilling into the dim light of the flashlights. In that moment, they had been invulnerable, united against the world.

The memory anchored her, pushing her through the dense thicket. But just as the thought solidified her resolve, a wave of dizziness washed over her. The Pulse's whispers intensified, wrapping around her mind like a vice.

*“You’re losing him,”* it hissed. *“You’ll never find him in time.”*

“No!” Sari shouted, clenching her fists. “I will not lose him! I refuse!” 

With each exclamation, she felt her strength surge, battling back against the encroaching darkness. Talon had always believed in her strength, and she would not let his faith be misplaced.

Finally, she broke through the trees, her heart leaping as she spotted a clearing ahead. The fog lifted slightly, revealing a scene that felt both familiar and surreal. There stood the cabin—half-constructed, yet a vision of their dreams. The skeletal structure loomed like a ghost, its beams reaching toward the sky, a testament to their plans and the love that had brought them here.

“Talon!” she cried out again, hope igniting within her. She rushed forward, each step a desperate plea to the universe. “Please, answer me!”

In the stillness that followed, she caught sight of a figure slumped against the wall, shadows dancing around him. Sari’s heart sank; it was Talon. The sight of him sent a rush of emotion coursing through her—relief, love, and a tidal wave of fear.

“Tal!” she shouted, rushing to his side. 

As she knelt beside him, the reality of the situation struck her. His skin was pale, and dark veins snaked across his arms, a stark reminder of the Pulse’s grip. He looked up, his eyes clouded yet flickering with recognition.

“Sari?” His voice was weak, a mere whisper, but it held a world of longing and guilt. “You shouldn’t have come. It’s not safe.”

“I don’t care about safety! I care about you!” She grasped his hand, squeezing it tightly, desperate to anchor him to her. “We can fight this together, Talon.”

Talon’s eyes shifted, a storm of emotions swirling within them. “I can feel it, Sari. The Pulse… it’s taking me. I can’t fight it much longer.” His voice cracked, and the pain in his words pierced her heart.

“*No!*” Sari felt anger welling up inside her, a fierce determination igniting her spirit. “You have to fight! Remember our dreams? The cabin? We can’t let it win!”

He looked away, tears glistening in his eyes. “What if I fail you?”

“Then we fight together, just like we always have!” Sari’s voice was a mix of desperation and fierce loyalty. “You’ve always been my light, Talon. Don’t you dare let it go out!”

In that moment, Talon’s expression shifted, a flicker of hope igniting behind the despair. “I want to believe you,” he murmured, squeezing her hand in return, a small act of defiance against the encroaching darkness.

Together, they faced the cabin that held the weight of their dreams and the essence of their love, prepared to confront the shadows of the Pulse that threatened to tear them apart. As the fog swirled around them, Sari's heart beat with determination, ready to fight for the future they had envisioned, no matter the cost.

**Chapter 2: The Cabin**

The cabin loomed before Sari, its skeletal frame standing defiantly against the backdrop of a dusky sky. The fog had thinned, but the weight of dread clung to her like a second skin. Each breath felt heavier than the last, filled with the scent of damp earth and the bittersweet memories of what this place had once represented.

Talon leaned against one of the rough-hewn beams, his face pale and drawn. The Pulse had transformed him, twisting his features into a mask of agony. He looked up as Sari approached, his eyes clouded yet sparking with a flicker of recognition that ignited a flame of hope within her.

“*Sari,*” he whispered, his voice raspy, like dry leaves scraping together in the wind. “You shouldn’t have come here. It’s too dangerous.”

She knelt before him, clutching his hands tightly in hers. “I don’t care about danger. I care about you.” Her eyes searched his, looking for the Talon she knew—the one filled with laughter and dreams. “You’re still in there. I know you are.”

Talon’s gaze flickered to the ground, shame washing over his features. “But I can feel it, Sari. The Pulse… it’s getting stronger. I can’t fight it much longer.” His voice trembled with a mix of fear and desperation.

“*No!*” Sari’s heart raced as anger surged within her, mingling with fear. “You have to fight! Remember our dreams? This cabin? Everything we talked about?” She gestured around them, her voice rising. “This is our future! You can’t let it win!”

His eyes met hers, a tumult of emotions swirling within—fear, guilt, and the flickering embers of hope. “What if I fail you? What if I hurt you?”

“Then we’ll face it together! You’ve always been my strength, Talon. I refuse to lose you to this monster!” Her grip on his hands tightened, grounding them both in their shared reality.

He shook his head, pain etched across his face. “I don’t want to become a burden. I can feel the Pulse clawing at me, trying to take me away from you.”

Sari’s heart shattered at his words. *How could he think that?* “You’re not a burden. You’re my everything!” Tears welled up in her eyes, a mixture of frustration and love. “I need you to fight for us—for the future we envisioned. Remember the cabin and what it represents?”

**Flashback**: A memory unfolded in her mind, bringing warmth amidst the chill of the current reality. They had sat together in a sunny field, sketching plans for the cabin. Talon had pointed out where the kitchen should go, his eyes sparkling with excitement as he spoke of morning coffee on the porch.

“*We’ll build it strong,*” he had said, his voice filled with determination. “*A place where we can create memories and chase our dreams, away from all this chaos.*”

“*And the walls will be filled with laughter,*” Sari had added, her heart soaring with possibilities. 

Now, standing in the shadow of that very cabin, Sari felt the weight of their dreams pressing down on her. “This cabin is a symbol of everything we’ve fought for. It’s a promise that we can weather any storm, even the Pulse. Please, Talon. Don’t give up on us.”

Talon’s expression shifted, the flicker of hope igniting again. “I want to believe you,” he murmured, tears glistening in his eyes.

“Then fight! Fight for us, Talon!” Sari urged, her voice breaking. “You’re not just a victim of this Pulse. You’re stronger than it. You’ve always been my rock.”

His grip tightened around hers, and for a moment, she saw the Talon she had fallen in love with—the one who faced challenges head-on, who built forts in storms and chased after the impossible. “You’re right,” he said, determination seeping into his voice. “I can’t let this thing take me.”

Together, they faced the cabin, a testament to their dreams and resilience. As shadows danced around them, Sari felt a swell of determination rising within her. They would confront this Pulse together, not just as victims but as fighters, united by the love that had brought them here.

As the night deepened, Sari leaned in, brushing her lips against his forehead. “We’ll get through this, Talon. I promise.”

With a newfound sense of purpose, they began to brainstorm how to fight back, drawing strength from each other and the dreams they still held dear. The cabin, with its unfinished walls and unfulfilled promises, became a rallying point for their spirits, a reminder that love and resilience could still conquer even the darkest of challenges.

**Chapter 3: The Confrontation**

The air inside the cabin was thick with tension, the remnants of their dreams lingering in the shadows. Sari paced the wooden floor, her heart racing as she felt the Pulse tightening its grip on Talon. He sat against the wall, his eyes glassy and distant, lost in a world that felt increasingly out of reach.

“Talon,” Sari said softly, kneeling beside him. “I need you to stay with me. Please.” She searched his gaze for a sign of the man she loved, the vibrant spark that had always illuminated their path.

“I’m trying, Sari,” he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. “But it’s like drowning. I can feel it pulling me under.” The vulnerability in his tone sent a shiver down her spine.

“*No!*” Sari’s voice cracked, a mixture of fear and anger bubbling to the surface. “You’re not drowning! You’re fighting, remember?” She grasped his hands tightly, willing her strength into him. “You’re stronger than this Pulse. You’ve always been my rock.”

Talon’s gaze shifted, and for a brief moment, she saw a flicker of recognition, a glimmer of the man who had once filled her life with laughter and adventure. “Sari, I’m scared,” he admitted, his voice trembling. “What if I can’t come back from this? What if I lose myself entirely?”

“You won’t lose yourself,” she insisted, her heart aching for him. “You’re still in there, Talon. Fight for us, fight for the cabin! Fight for everything we’ve dreamed of together.” Her voice broke, desperation bleeding through her words.

In that moment, a wave of memories crashed over them, and Sari found herself transported back to their childhood—the carefree days spent building forts and dreaming of the future. 

*“We’ll make it a place of laughter,”* she remembered saying, her voice bright with hope as they planned their cabin together. *“It’ll be our sanctuary, a place where we can escape from everything.”*

But now, the reality was stark and unforgiving. The cabin stood as a monument to their dreams, yet the shadows of the Pulse threatened to eclipse it all.

“Do you remember that time we built a fort during a storm?” she asked, trying to pull him back into their shared memories. “We were so convinced we were safe, just the two of us, with blankets and flashlights.”

A faint smile flickered across Talon’s face, but it quickly faded. “Yeah, but what if this storm is different? What if it’s too strong?” His voice was laced with uncertainty, a crack in the façade he had built.

“Then we’ll weather it together,” Sari replied fiercely, squeezing his hands. “You were always the brave one, Talon. You taught me to face my fears.” She leaned in closer, her forehead resting against his, sharing the warmth of their connection.

“I’m not that strong anymore,” he admitted, the vulnerability in his voice cutting through her.

“*You are,*” she insisted, pulling back to look into his eyes. “And I won’t let you give up. We’ve fought too hard to let this destroy us.” 

In that moment, the cabin creaked around them, a physical reminder of the dreams they had built. The walls seemed to whisper their hopes, echoing the laughter they had once shared. 

Talon blinked, and she could see the fight within him struggling against the encroaching shadows of the Pulse. “What if I hurt you?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper, laden with fear and guilt.

“*You won’t!*” Sari’s voice was steady, but her heart raced. “You love me, and that love is stronger than any darkness. Remember the teddy bear you gave me? It’s a piece of us—fragile yet resilient. Just like our love.”

He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, as if trying to anchor himself in her words. “I don’t want to lose that. I don’t want to lose you.”

“Then fight for it!” Sari pleaded, her heart pounding. “We can face this together. You’re not just a victim of the Pulse. You’re Talon Mercer, and you’ve always fought for what matters.”

For a moment, a flicker of light shone through the fog of despair that enveloped him. “Okay,” he breathed, a newfound determination settling in his gaze. “I’ll fight. For you. For us.”

The Pulse roared around them, but together, they were stronger. Sari felt the weight of the world pressing down, but she also felt a surge of power coursing through her as they faced the darkness together.

As they shared a moment of silence, the air thick with unspoken promises, Sari made a decision. “Let’s make a plan,” she said, pulling away slightly to look into his eyes. “We’ll find a way to combat this Pulse. We can’t let it take you, Talon.”

“Together,” he echoed, nodding slowly, the bond between them reigniting.

In that moment, as the cabin stood tall around them, Sari felt hope rise like a phoenix from the ashes of despair. They were not just battling the Pulse; they were fighting for their love, their future, and the dreams they had shared. 

With their hearts aligned, they began to strategize, using their shared dreams as their foundation. Each word they spoke forged a path forward, binding them together against the tide of darkness that threatened to engulf them.

**Chapter 4: Inside the Cabin**

The cabin was more than just wood and nails—it was a vessel for their shared dreams, a place where they had built hopes for the future. Now, it felt like the last thread connecting them to a reality slipping away. Sari stood at the door, the cold metal of the handle chilling her palm, her heart racing as memories surged back. The air was heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, but it carried with it the weight of uncertainty. Everything about the cabin felt distorted, its once-welcoming aura now tinged with something darker.

She pushed the door open. The groan of the wood echoed, and the air inside was thick with dust, swirling in the faint light that leaked through the dirty windows. Blueprints lay scattered on the floor—drawings of the future they had once imagined. But the future had become a fragile, fleeting concept now. Sari knelt, tracing her fingers over one of the sketches, her chest tightening.

“This place… it holds everything we wanted,” she whispered, her voice trembling as though afraid the cabin might hear her thoughts and disapprove of them.

Talon stood by the window, his broad shoulders hunched forward, staring out into the fog. The shadows seemed to cling to him, and his pale face was drawn tight, the dark veins of the Pulse visible beneath his skin. He hadn’t spoken in what felt like hours.

“Maybe… maybe this was all a mistake,” Talon murmured, his voice sounding distant and hollow. “Who needs a cabin when it’s all falling apart?”

Sari forced herself to move. “We do. We need it, Talon. This is us. This place is the last part of us that’s still real.” Her voice was filled with a mix of determination and pleading as she walked to him, taking his hand. It was cold—too cold.

Talon flinched at the touch, but he didn’t pull away. “I don’t even remember what ‘real’ feels like anymore.” His eyes, glazed over with the Pulse, were distant, as though he was already halfway gone.

Sari's heart clenched, but she refused to let the fear win. She smiled, though it was shaky. “Remember when you almost tipped me out of the wheelbarrow? You thought it was hilarious, and I thought I was going to die.”

A faint flicker of warmth touched his lips, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Yeah… you were screaming your head off, and you couldn’t even hold on.”

“But you didn’t let me fall,” Sari added softly, trying to draw him back. “You never did.”

Talon’s smile faded, and he looked down at their hands. “Maybe I can’t stop it this time.”

“No, we’re not giving up,” Sari said, her voice firm but laced with emotion. “Not now. This is our home. This is where we’re safe.”

She knelt beside him, pulling out the old vision board they had once made, now tattered and worn. She spread it across the floor, pointing to the sketches, the lists of plans they had once shared. “This isn’t just a cabin. It’s us. It’s everything we built together.”

For a moment, Talon’s gaze softened as he looked down at the images—drawings of the cabin in different seasons, notes about how they’d fill it with their future children’s laughter. But then the Pulse surged again. Talon’s body tensed, his breath quickening as his hands trembled.

“I’m losing it, Sari,” he rasped. “I can’t fight it anymore. I don’t even know who I am.”

“You are Talon,” Sari insisted, gripping his hands so tightly her knuckles turned white. “You’re still the same boy who built dreams with me. You’re still here.”

“I don’t feel like I’m here,” Talon whispered, his voice cracking. “What if I disappear for good?”

“You won’t!” Sari cried, her voice rising. “You can’t leave me. I won’t let you.”

But the shadows thickened around them, and Sari could feel the Pulse pulling him away, inch by inch. Talon’s body shuddered, his breath coming in short gasps, his skin cold beneath her touch.

“I don’t want to leave,” Talon gasped. “But… if I do, promise me you’ll remember me. The real me.”

Tears blurred Sari’s vision as she nodded, her throat tight. “I promise. I’ll remember you—the boy who never let me fall.”

---

**Chapter 5: The Breaking Point**

The cabin felt smaller now, as though the walls were closing in, trapping them inside. The fog outside pressed against the windows like a silent predator, the cold seeping into the wood. Talon sat on the edge of the bed, his body trembling, sweat pouring down his face despite the chill in the air. Every breath he took seemed to hurt, every moment felt like a battle.

Sari paced in front of him, her mind spinning with a thousand thoughts, each one more desperate than the last. “We have to find a way,” she muttered, more to herself than to Talon. “We can’t just let this happen.”

Talon’s head dropped, his shoulders sagging with exhaustion. “What’s the point? I can’t even think straight anymore.”

“Don’t say that!” Sari snapped, spinning to face him. Her hands balled into fists. “You’re not alone in this. We’re in this together. Remember what we talked about? The cabin, the life we planned?”

“I remember,” Talon whispered, his voice barely audible. “But it feels like it’s slipping away.”

Sari crossed the room, dropping to her knees in front of him, her hands gripping his shoulders. “It’s not. We’ve fought too hard for this. You’ve fought too hard. Don’t give up now.”

Talon looked down at her, his face pale and drawn, the veins of the Pulse creeping up his neck. “I don’t know if I have anything left to fight with.”

“You do,” Sari insisted, her voice fierce. “You’ve always been the strong one. You’ve always fought for us. We can’t lose this.”

Talon’s eyes clouded with doubt, his breath quickening. “But what if I’m not me anymore? What if the Pulse takes over, and I’m gone?”

“You’re still here,” Sari whispered, her voice softening. “You’re still Talon.”

He shook his head. “What if I’m not? What if the Pulse changes me into something else?”

“You won’t change,” Sari said, though the tremble in her voice betrayed her fear. “You’re my Talon. You’ll always be my Talon.”

But even as she said it, she could feel the darkness pressing in, the weight of the Pulse growing heavier with every second. Talon’s grip on her hands was weakening, his breath shallow, his body trembling uncontrollably.

“Promise me,” Talon rasped, his voice barely above a whisper. “Promise me you’ll remember who I was. The real me.”

Sari’s tears spilled over, and she nodded, her throat too tight to speak. “I promise. I’ll remember the boy who built dreams with me.”

### **Chapter 6: Jack’s Game**

The wind cut through the forest, sharp as a blade, but Jack Vine barely noticed. He was too busy **calculating**. Every step, every glance, every shift in the fog—he processed it all. He had been tracking the Pulse for months now, following it like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike. 

Only, in this game, Jack wasn’t sure who the predator was anymore.

He tightened the strap on his backpack, eyes scanning the dense undergrowth. This forest was alive, more alive than anything he'd ever seen. The trees bent at unnatural angles, the ground trembled beneath his boots, and the fog twisted in ways that defied explanation. The Pulse wasn’t just warping the environment—it was **playing** with it. With him. But Jack wasn’t easily rattled. 

He couldn’t afford to be.

“Clever little trick you’ve got here,” Jack muttered, almost as if speaking to the Pulse itself. “But I’ve seen better.”

He crouched down, brushing aside a layer of dead leaves to reveal the faint markings etched into the ground. **Symbols**—strange, ancient, and pulsating faintly beneath his fingertips. Jack’s lips twitched into a smirk. The Pulse had a language, a pattern, and patterns could be **broken**. 

“I’ll figure you out,” he said, standing up and dusting off his hands. “It’s only a matter of time.”

Time. That was always the trick, wasn’t it? Jack had learned early on that control was an illusion, that life was a series of moves and countermoves, strategies and bluffs. And he had always been good at **games**. 

The Pulse was just another opponent. A clever one, sure, but not invincible. Nothing was invincible.

He pulled his notebook from his jacket pocket, flipping it open to the latest page of diagrams, notes, and calculations. Every line, every scribble was precise. He didn’t make mistakes. Jack had been trained for this—tracking anomalies, studying the inexplicable. He had always known the Pulse was more than just some natural phenomenon. It had an intelligence, a **design**, and Jack was going to crack it.

He glanced at the scars running down his jawline, feeling the familiar roughness beneath his gloved hand. The Pulse had marked him during their first encounter, left a **signature** on him. It had almost killed him, but that was its mistake—leaving him alive to fight back. 

Jack never forgot when an opponent showed its hand too early.

“You’re overconfident,” he muttered, flipping the notebook shut and tucking it away. “That’s how I’ll beat you.”

The fog shifted, swirling around him, thick and cold. Jack could feel the Pulse pressing against his mind, tugging at the edges, trying to worm its way inside. It wanted to break him, to turn him into one of its hollowed-out puppets. He’d seen it happen before. 

But Jack was different. He wasn’t easily broken.

The whispers started again—faint, barely audible, but there. **“You’re alone… You’ll fail…”**

Jack grinned. “Nice try, but I’ve heard worse. You’ll have to up your game if you want to get inside my head.”

He pressed on, his boots crunching against the uneven ground. The deeper he ventured into the forest, the more twisted the landscape became. Trees with split bark, oozing black sap, bent and twisted like something out of a nightmare. The fog hung low, swirling around the branches like a serpent, coiling tighter the further he went.

But Jack wasn’t afraid. He **thrived** on pressure, on pushing his mind to its limits. That’s what made him special. Where others broke down, lost themselves in fear, Jack found clarity. The world became a chessboard, every move and countermove clearer, sharper. And Jack always knew how to win.

Suddenly, a low rumble vibrated through the ground, and Jack paused, narrowing his eyes. The Pulse was close, its energy thrumming beneath his feet, pulsating with a rhythm he almost recognized. He crouched down, pressing his hand to the earth, feeling the pulse travel through his fingertips, up his arm, and into his mind.

“Almost there,” he whispered, his lips curling into a smile. “Almost time.”

He stood, dusting off his gloves. The wind shifted, carrying with it a sound—faint, but unmistakable. A voice. 

“Jack…” 

His heart skipped a beat, and for the first time in hours, his grin faltered. He turned, scanning the fog for the source of the voice, his mind racing. The Pulse was trying something new—he could feel it. 

“Nice trick,” he muttered, though his voice was quieter now. “But you’ll have to do better than that.”

The figure appeared suddenly, materializing out of the fog at the edge of the clearing. Jack’s heart raced, adrenaline spiking, but he didn’t move. He stood perfectly still, studying the figure. 

It was tall, shrouded in the thick fog, its features impossible to make out. But it wasn’t human—not anymore.

Jack’s grip tightened around the strap of his bag. He knew better than to approach, better than to engage with something that was clearly bait. But something about the figure… something familiar in the way it stood.

“Who are you?” he called out, his voice steady, though his mind was working a mile a minute. 

The figure didn’t answer. It just stood there, unmoving, waiting. Jack’s eyes narrowed. The Pulse was playing games again—testing him, seeing how far it could push before he broke. 

He took a step forward. “You think I’m going to fall for this? You think I don’t see through you?”

The figure shifted slightly, as if acknowledging his words, but said nothing. Jack clenched his jaw, his mind spinning with possibilities. What was the Pulse trying to accomplish? Was this a distraction? A challenge? Or something worse?

“You want me to engage,” Jack said, more to himself than to the figure. “You want me to play your game. But that’s the thing about games… I don’t play to lose.”

He took another step forward, his hand hovering near the weapon at his side. The figure remained still, the fog swirling around it like a shroud. Jack’s pulse quickened. This was a test, a move on the Pulse’s part to draw him in, to make him falter. But Jack wasn’t one to falter.

“Too bad for you,” he said with a grin. “I’m the best there is.”

He turned sharply, walking away from the figure without a second glance. He could feel the Pulse trying to push harder, pressing against his mind, but he blocked it out, focusing instead on the path ahead. He wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction of rattling him.

Not today.

**Chapter 7: Deeper into the Forest**

Sari’s legs were weak, her breath ragged as she stumbled through the thick fog. The Pulse was closing in, tightening its grip on her mind, her memories, her very sense of reality. She could feel it—relentless, insidious, warping everything around her. The fog seemed to press against her skin, seeping into her thoughts, distorting the world beyond recognition. Every step felt like a battle, her mind fraying at the edges as the Pulse whispered in her ear, taunting her, pulling her deeper into the darkness.

But she wasn’t done yet.

Somewhere out there, Talon was still alive, buried beneath whatever the Pulse had turned him into. She had to believe that. If she didn’t, the Pulse would win, and she couldn’t let that happen. Not now. Not after coming this far.

Suddenly, the ground beneath her shifted. The earth trembled with a low, rhythmic pulse, and Sari stopped, her heart pounding in her chest. The fog parted for just a moment, revealing a figure standing just ahead, obscured by the trees. 

Her breath caught in her throat. **Talon?**

But something about the figure was wrong—too tall, too rigid, the silhouette unfamiliar. Sari’s hope withered as quickly as it had bloomed. Whoever this was, it wasn’t Talon.

She gripped the necklace hanging from her neck, her only remaining connection to him. She had to keep moving. She had to—

“Stop right there.” The voice was sharp, cutting through the fog like a knife. It wasn’t Talon’s voice. It was someone else’s.

Sari froze, her pulse quickening. She strained to see through the fog, but the figure remained shrouded in mist. Slowly, cautiously, she took a step forward.

“I said, stop.” The voice came again, this time louder, more forceful. Whoever this person was, they were close—and they weren’t afraid to assert control.

Sari hesitated, her body tense. She didn’t know if this person was an ally or another danger lurking in the fog. For all she knew, it could be the Pulse itself, using someone else’s voice, playing tricks on her mind.

“Who are you?” Sari called out, her voice trembling but determined. She couldn’t afford to show weakness now, not when she was so close to breaking.

The figure moved closer, stepping through the fog, and as the mist parted, Sari could make out the sharp lines of his face. He was tall, with a lean, wiry frame, his clothes disheveled and weathered from months of exposure to the elements. His eyes were sharp, calculating, a deep intelligence behind them that Sari couldn’t ignore.

“Jack Vine,” he said, his voice laced with a confidence that bordered on arrogance. He had a way of speaking like he was already three moves ahead, like he had already figured out who she was, what she wanted, and how to use it against her.

Sari tightened her grip on the necklace. “Are you with the Pulse?”

Jack’s lips quirked into a smile, cold and humorless. “If I were, you’d already be dead.”

Sari’s heart skipped a beat. There was no warmth in his voice, just a brutal honesty that sent a chill down her spine. But something about him felt different. He wasn’t like the others—the twisted, hollowed-out versions of people she had seen before, those who had fallen to the Pulse. No, Jack was something else. 

“What are you doing out here?” she asked, her voice steadier now, though her muscles remained tense, ready for whatever might come next.

“Same as you, I imagine,” Jack said, taking a step closer. “Surviving. Tracking the Pulse. Trying to figure out how to beat it.”

Sari’s eyes narrowed. “And you think you can beat it?”

Jack’s smile widened, but there was no joy in it. “I don’t think. I know.”

Sari took a step back, the weight of his words pressing down on her. His confidence was unsettling, but at the same time, it was hard to ignore. There was something about him—something sharp and calculating, like he was playing a game that only he knew the rules to.

“Why should I trust you?” Sari asked, her voice low and wary.

“You shouldn’t,” Jack said, shrugging. “But I’m your best option right now.”

He was right, of course. Sari didn’t have the luxury of turning down help, no matter how unsettling it might be. She needed allies, and if Jack Vine was the only one offering, she didn’t have much choice.

The fog swirled around them, thick and oppressive, as if it was alive, watching, waiting. Sari could feel the Pulse’s presence growing stronger with each passing second, pressing against her mind, trying to find a way in. She had to stay focused, had to keep moving forward, but the world was slipping away from her, reality bending and warping under the Pulse’s influence.

Jack’s voice broke through the haze. “We need to move. Now.”

Sari nodded, though her legs felt heavy, her mind sluggish. The Pulse was everywhere now, its presence suffocating, but she forced herself to keep going. She followed Jack as he moved swiftly through the forest, his steps confident and sure, like he knew exactly where he was going.

“How long have you been out here?” Sari asked, struggling to keep up.

“Long enough,” Jack said, his tone clipped. “The Pulse isn’t just some random anomaly. It’s evolving. Growing. And if we don’t stop it soon, there won’t be anything left to save.”

Sari’s stomach churned. She had known it was bad, but hearing Jack say it with such certainty made it feel more real, more immediate. “Do you know what it wants?”

Jack glanced at her, his eyes calculating. “It wants control. Over everything.”

They moved deeper into the forest, the fog growing thicker, more oppressive. The trees seemed to close in around them, their branches twisting and bending at unnatural angles. The ground trembled beneath their feet, the Pulse’s energy thrumming through the earth, through the very air they breathed.

“We’re getting closer,” Jack said, his voice tense. “It’s stronger here.”

Sari swallowed hard, her heart racing. “What’s stronger?”

“The Pulse,” Jack said, his eyes narrowing. “It’s concentrated in this area. Whatever it’s doing, it’s using this place as a hub.”

Sari’s mind raced, trying to make sense of it all. “A hub? You mean like a central point?”

Jack nodded. “Something like that. It’s using this part of the forest to spread its influence, to manipulate reality. If we can figure out what’s at the center of it, we might have a chance to stop it.”

Sari felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the weight of the Pulse pressing down on her mind, distorting her thoughts, twisting her memories. The world felt wrong—off-kilter, like it was slipping away from her.

“I don’t know if I can make it,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Jack turned to her, his gaze sharp and unrelenting. “You can. Because you don’t have a choice.”

His words were harsh, but they cut through the fog in her mind, grounding her, giving her something to hold on to. She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She couldn’t give up now. Not when they were this close.

The ground trembled beneath them again, a low, rhythmic pulse that vibrated through the earth, growing stronger with each passing second. Sari could feel it now, deep in her bones—the Pulse, alive and sentient, watching, waiting for the right moment to strike.

“We’re almost there,” Jack said, his voice low, tense.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest. They were heading straight into the heart of the Pulse’s influence, and she had no idea what they would find when they got there. But one thing was certain: whatever waited for them in the depths of the forest, they had to face it together.

### **Chapter 8: The Bunker**

The forest seemed to be drawing them in, the trees bending unnaturally as Sari and Jack pressed forward. The fog was heavier here, like a wall around them, muffling the sounds of their footsteps and the distant pulse of the ground. The weight of the Pulse’s presence was undeniable—thick, suffocating, like the air itself was trying to crush them.

“We’re close,” Jack said, his voice steady but tense. “Too close.”

Sari could feel it too. The Pulse wasn’t just an energy—it was alive, and it was watching them. The weight of its gaze pressed down on her mind, making it harder to think, harder to remember why she was here. But then she gripped the necklace around her neck, feeling the cool metal press into her skin, grounding her in the moment.

They emerged into a small clearing, and there it was—the bunker. A rusted metal structure, half-buried beneath overgrown vines and earth, hidden from view until they were almost on top of it. The door hung slightly ajar, the heavy steel groaning as the wind shifted.

“This is it,” Jack said, already moving toward the entrance. His voice was low, but there was an edge of excitement there, a glint in his eyes that Sari didn’t trust.

Sari’s heart raced as she followed him inside. The air was stale, thick with dust and decay, the faint scent of metal and something far more unsettling—like old blood. The bunker was small, just a couple of rooms, the walls lined with shelves full of old, yellowing files. In the corner, a desk stood cluttered with papers, the only source of light a single flickering bulb above it.

Jack moved quickly, his hands rifling through the papers, his eyes scanning the pages with sharp intensity. “They knew about it,” he muttered under his breath, more to himself than to her.

Sari hesitated near the entrance, her eyes drawn to the far wall. It was cracked, a jagged fissure running along the metal, and for a moment, she thought she saw something—**shadows moving** just beyond it. She shivered, her pulse quickening, but she forced herself to focus.

“What do you mean, they knew?” she asked, stepping closer to Jack.

Jack held up a file, his expression grim. “The government. They’ve been studying the Pulse for years.”

Sari’s stomach churned as she took the file from him. The cover was faded, but the words **FBI Paranormal Division Report** were still legible. She flipped it open, her hands trembling as she scanned the pages. 

“They called it an anomaly at first,” Jack continued, pacing around the room as he spoke. “Something they couldn’t explain—energy signatures, strange distortions. They thought it was a natural phenomenon. But it wasn’t.”

Sari’s eyes skimmed over the detailed accounts—dates, locations, the names of people who had encountered the Pulse and hadn’t survived. The descriptions were chilling. People who had been **erased**—not just killed, but **wiped** from existence, their memories fading from the minds of those who had known them.

“They tried to contain it,” Jack said, his voice growing darker. “Experiments, quarantines, entire towns disappeared. But nothing worked. The Pulse adapted. It always does.”

Sari’s throat tightened as she read on. The report detailed the government’s **failed experiments**—attempts to control the Pulse using technology, even weaponry. But every attempt had ended in disaster. The Pulse wasn’t just an anomaly. It was sentient. A predator, feeding off everything in its path.

“They knew it was dangerous,” Sari whispered, her voice shaking. “And they didn’t stop it.”

Jack snorted, a bitter laugh escaping him. “Of course they didn’t. They thought they could use it. That’s always the mistake.”

Sari’s hands trembled as she turned the page, her breath catching in her throat. The last few pages of the report were heavily redacted, entire sections blacked out, but there were enough words visible to understand the truth. The Pulse was growing stronger with each encounter. Each person, each town it consumed made it more powerful, more impossible to stop.

“They tried to study it,” Jack said, pulling another file from the desk. “Thought they could harness it, maybe even turn it into a weapon. But they couldn’t control it.”

Sari’s stomach churned as she stared at the pages. The report mentioned something called **Project Resonance**, an experiment to use sound waves to disrupt the Pulse’s energy. But it had failed—spectacularly. The last entry was from a scientist who had watched his entire team get consumed, their minds twisted and shattered before they disappeared completely.

The report ended abruptly, the final page stained with something dark—blood, maybe. Sari’s hands shook as she closed the file, her mind racing. The government had known about the Pulse for years. They had tried to stop it, and when they couldn’t, they buried it—hid the truth from the world, letting it spread unchecked.

“We have to get out of here,” Sari said, her voice rising in panic. “If it’s feeding off this place—”

But before she could finish, a loud crack echoed through the bunker. The wall beside them groaned, the metal bending as a long, jagged crack snaked its way across the surface. The air around them felt heavy, thick with the Pulse’s energy, and the room seemed to pulse in time with it, like a heartbeat.

Jack grabbed her arm, pulling her back. “We need to move. Now.”

Sari’s heart pounded as they backed away from the crack, but it was too late. The walls trembled, the air around them vibrating with an eerie hum. And then, the crack widened. A thin, black mist seeped through the opening, curling in the air like smoke. 

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. The mist wasn’t just **mist**. It was alive. It twisted in the air, forming shapes—shadows that seemed to whisper as they moved. She could hear them now, faint, distorted voices, their words incomprehensible but full of malice.

The crack sealed itself as quickly as it had opened, the mist vanishing as if it had never been there. But the whispers remained, echoing in Sari’s mind, growing louder with every passing second.

Jack didn’t wait. He grabbed the files he had collected, shoving them into his bag. “We’re leaving. Now.”

Sari’s legs felt weak, her mind reeling from what she had just seen. The Pulse was here—inside the bunker, feeding off the remnants of the government’s experiments, growing stronger with every passing moment. 

They moved quickly, but as they reached the door, the ground trembled again, and for a moment, Sari thought she heard something—a voice, distant but familiar.

**Talon.**

She stopped, her heart racing. She could hear him. He was calling her name, his voice distorted, twisted by the Pulse, but still recognizable. 

“Sari—”

Jack pulled her through the door, his grip tight on her arm. “We don’t have time for this.”

Sari’s mind was spinning, her thoughts scattered, but she forced herself to move. Talon was out there—somewhere. And the Pulse wasn’t going to let him go without a fight.

As they emerged from the bunker, the forest felt different. The fog was thicker, darker, and the Pulse’s presence was stronger than ever. It was everywhere, surrounding them, watching, waiting.

Jack didn’t slow down. “We need to keep moving. We’re not safe yet.”

Sari nodded, her legs trembling as they moved deeper into the forest. The Pulse was growing stronger, more aggressive, and the truth of the FBI’s report weighed heavily on her mind. The Pulse wasn’t just a force of nature. It was a predator. And now, it was coming for them.
