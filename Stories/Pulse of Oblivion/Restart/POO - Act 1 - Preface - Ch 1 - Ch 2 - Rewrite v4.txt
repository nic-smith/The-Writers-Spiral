**Chapter 2: The Cabin**

The cabin stood in the clearing, warped and twisted, like a once-beautiful memory now rotted by time. The roof sagged, its wooden beams cracked and decaying, and the walls seemed to lean inward as if the Pulse had reached inside, **tearing apart the dream it once was**. The sight of it struck Sari like a blow, her breath catching in her throat.

This place was supposed to be their refuge—a place to create, to build, to dream. **But now... it was a graveyard of their hopes.**

Sari stood at the threshold, her fingers trembling as she gripped the doorframe. The air was heavy here, thick with the stench of rot and decay. **The Pulse was everywhere**, creeping through the walls, pressing down on her like an invisible weight. She could feel it, crawling at the edges of her mind, its cold tendrils slithering through her thoughts, whispering that **she was too late**.

Her chest tightened. She didn’t want to believe it—not yet. **Talon had to be here.** He had to be.

But as she stepped inside, her heart pounding, the reality of it all closed in around her. The cabin was falling apart, the floorboards warped and cracking beneath her boots. The windows were shattered, letting the thick fog press in, wrapping the room in a suffocating haze.

Then she saw him.

**Talon stood by the window**, his back to her, his broad shoulders hunched. For a moment, hope flickered in Sari’s chest—brief, fragile, but enough to pull her forward.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice shaking.

He didn’t move.

Her legs trembled as she took another step toward him, her heart pounding harder in her chest. **It had to be him.** It had to be. But something was wrong. His outline—his body—it was flickering, as though the air around him was rippling, distorting him. **The Pulse.**

“Talon!” Her voice broke this time, louder, more desperate.

Slowly, he turned to face her, but as his eyes met hers, **her hope shattered**.

His face was hollow, his eyes dull and lifeless. **The man she loved was gone.** 

The Pulse had taken him, twisted him. His skin, once warm and vibrant, was now pale and gray, and just beneath the surface, **black veins pulsed**, crawling across his neck, his arms, like dark vines choking the life out of him. The darkness twisted through his body, **alive and consuming him from the inside**.

“Talon...” Her voice was barely a whisper now, trembling as she stepped closer, her hands shaking. She reached out, her fingers brushing against his cold skin. **He recoiled.**

For a moment—just a moment—**his eyes cleared**. A flicker of recognition passed through them, brief but real. **Talon was still in there**, somewhere. Sari’s breath caught in her throat, hope surging in her chest.

But then, just as quickly, the Pulse surged through him, and **the light in his eyes dimmed**. His body convulsed, his limbs jerking violently as the black veins snaked across his face, wrapping around him like chains, pulling him deeper into its control.

“No!” Sari cried, her voice raw. She reached for him again, grabbing his arm, holding onto him with everything she had, but his body twisted beneath her grip. **The Pulse was devouring him**—piece by piece.

His chest heaved, his breath coming in ragged gasps as his body convulsed again. **His fingers bent at unnatural angles**, his nails turning black, his skin rippling as though something inside him was fighting to escape. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she held him, her hands trembling.

“Talon, please!” she cried, her voice breaking. **“Fight it! You’re stronger than this!”**

For a brief moment, **his eyes met hers again**, and she saw him—really saw him. His lips parted, and he whispered her name, barely audible, but it was there. **“Sari...”**

Her heart leapt. **He was still in there.**

“Talon, I’m here! I’m right here!” She tightened her grip on him, her fingers digging into his cold skin, desperate to pull him back. “Don’t let go! I won’t let go!”

But then the cabin groaned around them. **The walls trembled**, the floorboards shuddering beneath her feet. The Pulse wasn’t finished—it wasn’t done with him.

The darkness surged again, **violently**, and Talon’s body jerked, his eyes rolling back as the black veins pulsed, spreading faster now, crawling across his face, his neck, **swallowing him whole**.

“No!” Sari screamed, her voice raw and desperate, but it was too late. The Pulse was too strong. **It was taking him—consuming him**.

His body convulsed one last time before collapsing into her arms, limp and lifeless. **The light in his eyes flickered out, and the darkness took him.**

Sari fell to her knees, **her body trembling** as she cradled his cold form, her tears falling freely now. She had failed. She had come all this way, fought so hard, and in the end, the Pulse had taken him from her. **She had lost him.**

Her hands shook as they rested on his chest, her fingers brushing against the black veins that still pulsed beneath his skin, faint but persistent. He was gone, and the Pulse was still inside him, still consuming him, even now.

---

For a moment, the world around her **blurred**. The cabin, the fog, the Pulse—it all felt distant, like she was floating somewhere between reality and the nightmare that had swallowed her whole. 

And then, **Talon’s body twitched**.

Sari froze, her heart pounding in her chest. **No. It couldn’t be.**

But there it was again—**a faint, fragile movement**. His chest rose, just barely, his fingers twitching. Sari’s breath caught in her throat, hope flaring in her chest once more. **He wasn’t gone. Not yet.**

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling. **Could he still be in there?**

But as she reached for him, the cabin groaned again. The walls shuddered, and the floor beneath them shook. The Pulse was growing stronger, its presence pressing down on her like a weight, suffocating the air around her. 

The black veins beneath Talon’s skin **pulsed violently**, the darkness spreading faster now, creeping across his body, up his neck, over his face. His body jerked, **convulsing violently**, his back arching off the floor as the Pulse surged through him.

“No!” Sari cried, her voice breaking as she held onto him. “Don’t leave me! **Fight it! Please, Talon, fight it!**”

But his body convulsed again, harder this time, his limbs jerking, his eyes snapping open. They were dark now, **pitch black**, with no light left in them, no trace of the man she had loved.

He screamed—a raw, guttural scream that tore through the air, shaking the walls of the cabin. His body twisted in her arms, **contorting unnaturally**, as though something inside him was breaking free.

Sari recoiled, her heart pounding, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps. **The Pulse wasn’t just taking him—it was transforming him** into something else, something monstrous.

“Talon, please!” she begged, her voice shaking. **But he didn’t respond.**

The cabin groaned louder, the walls trembling as cracks spidered across the wooden beams, splintering under the pressure. **The Pulse was devouring everything**, pulling the cabin, Talon, and Sari into its grip.

Sari’s mind raced. She couldn’t let it take him—not like this. Not again.

But the Pulse’s grip tightened, **dark tendrils reaching out**, wrapping around her arms, her legs, pulling her toward the floor. It was cold—so cold—**as though it was freezing her from the inside out**. She could feel it creeping into her thoughts, whispering in her mind, pulling her deeper into the darkness.

*You can’t save him,* the Pulse whispered, its voice soft but cruel. *You’re already too late. He’s gone, and you’re next.*

Sari screamed, her body trembling as she fought against the Pulse’s grip, her hands clutching Talon’s cold form. **She wouldn’t let go. She couldn’t.**

“I won’t lose you!” she cried, her voice fierce, even as the Pulse’s tendrils tightened around her. **“I won’t let you go! Not again!”**

**Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

The air in the cabin felt like it was closing in, thick and suffocating. **Talon lay still in her arms**, his body cold, the black veins pulsing faintly beneath his skin. Sari’s heart raced, her breath coming in shallow gasps as she held onto him, her mind reeling.

He was gone. **Really gone** this time.

Her fingers trembled as they brushed against his chest, her tears falling silently onto his cold skin. She had failed. **Everything she had fought for, all the hope she had clung to—it had meant nothing.**

The Pulse had taken him.

Sari’s throat tightened, her chest aching with the weight of it all. She had fought so hard to bring him back, to pull him from the Pulse’s grip, but in the end, it hadn’t been enough. **She wasn’t enough.**

A deep, hollow numbness settled in her bones as she sat there, cradling him in the dim light of the collapsing cabin. **What was the point of continuing now?** 

The walls groaned, the sound of splintering wood echoing through the cabin as the Pulse tightened its grip. **Everything around her was falling apart**—just like Talon, just like her.

*Maybe it was time to let go.* The thought whispered through her mind like a cold wind, chilling her to the core. **What was left for her now, without him?**

But then, through the oppressive silence, **Talon’s body twitched**.

Sari froze, her breath catching in her throat. **No. It couldn’t be.**

But there it was again—**a faint movement**, his chest rising, just barely, his fingers twitching. **He was still alive.**

Her heart leapt, hope flaring in her chest. **He wasn’t gone. Not yet.**

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling, barely more than a breath. She leaned closer, her hand gently cupping his face, feeling the faint warmth returning to his skin. 

His eyelids fluttered, his lips parting as he gasped for breath. It was faint, so faint, but it was there.

“Please, Talon,” she whispered, her fingers brushing the hair from his forehead. **“Come back to me. I’m right here.”**

But then the cabin groaned again, louder this time, and Sari’s hope faltered. **The Pulse wasn’t done with him.** 

The black veins beneath his skin pulsed violently, creeping up his neck, twisting across his face. His body **jerked**, his chest heaving as the Pulse tightened its grip, pulling him deeper into its control. His eyes snapped open, **pitch black**, with no trace of the man she had loved.

Sari’s heart raced. **He wasn’t Talon anymore.** The Pulse had him.

“No...” she whispered, her hands trembling as she held onto him, refusing to let go. **“Fight it, Talon. Please, fight it.”**

But his body convulsed again, harder this time. His limbs twisted unnaturally, his back arching off the floor as a low, guttural growl escaped his throat. **The Pulse was transforming him**—twisting him into something monstrous, something unrecognizable.

Sari’s breath came in ragged bursts as she knelt beside him, her mind racing. **What could she do?** She couldn’t leave him like this. **She couldn’t let the Pulse take him completely.**

But the black veins pulsed again, **spreading faster now**, creeping across his body, and Sari knew—**if she didn’t act now, she would lose him forever.**

---

For a brief, terrifying moment, the thought of letting go crossed her mind. 

Would it be kinder to release him? To let the Pulse take him, instead of dragging out his suffering? **The Pulse had consumed him so thoroughly—was there even anything left to save?**

Her heart clenched at the thought, guilt crashing over her in waves. **Could she really do that? Could she just let him go?**

But as she looked down at him, his body convulsing beneath her hands, she knew the answer. **She couldn’t.**

Sari’s grip tightened on his arm, her fingers digging into his skin as she knelt closer, her voice shaking with desperation. “Talon, listen to me,” she whispered, her voice low but fierce. “You have to fight this. **I know you’re in there.** Don’t let it take you. **I’m not leaving you.**”

His body convulsed again, a sharp cry escaping his lips as the black veins twisted across his face, warping his features. **But his eyes met hers**, and for just a moment, she saw him—**the real him**—beneath the darkness.

“Sari...” he rasped, his voice weak, but it was him.

Her breath caught in her throat, tears filling her eyes. **He was still there**.

“I’m here, Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she clung to him. **“I’m not leaving you.”**

But the Pulse wasn’t done.

The cabin groaned, the walls shuddering violently as the Pulse surged again, its dark tendrils creeping through the air, **reaching for her**. Sari gasped, her body trembling as she felt its cold grip on her arms, pulling her toward the floor. **The Pulse was trying to take her too.**

*You can’t save him,* the Pulse hissed, its voice cold and cruel, slithering into her mind. *You’ve already lost him. Let go.*

“No,” Sari whispered, her voice trembling but fierce. **“I won’t let you take him. Not again.”**

The Pulse tightened its grip, the darkness curling around her like a noose, cold and suffocating. **It wasn’t just taking Talon—it was coming for her.**

---

Sari’s mind raced. She couldn’t let the Pulse consume her, but **she couldn’t leave Talon behind either**. Not after everything they had been through, not after everything they had fought for.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched Talon’s hand, her heart pounding. **What was she supposed to do?** If she stayed, the Pulse would take them both. But if she left... **what would be left of him?**

The Pulse’s tendrils wrapped tighter around her, pulling her toward the floor, freezing her limbs. Sari gasped, her breath coming in shallow bursts, her vision blurring as the Pulse sank deeper into her mind, whispering lies, feeding on her fears.

*He’s already gone. You’re wasting your time. There’s nothing left to save.*

But Sari refused to believe it. **She couldn’t.**

“I’m not leaving you,” she whispered, her voice fierce despite the fear clawing at her chest. “I won’t lose you, Talon. **I won’t lose you.**”

---

The cabin groaned again, the floor beneath them shuddering violently as cracks splintered through the wooden beams. **The Pulse was growing stronger**, its presence suffocating the air, warping the space around them.

But Sari didn’t let go.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she clutched his hand. “**You have to fight this.** I’m not letting you go.”

His eyes flickered again, the blackness receding just for a moment. His hand twitched in hers, weak but real.

“Sari...” he rasped, his voice barely more than a breath. **But it was him.**

She held onto that moment, clinging to it with everything she had. **He was still there.**

But then the Pulse surged one final time, the darkness swallowing him whole. **His body convulsed violently**, his back arching as a raw, primal scream tore from his throat. Sari’s breath caught in her throat, her heart shattering as she watched him slip away from her.

The Pulse’s tendrils tightened around her, pulling her down, pulling her into the darkness.

But she refused to let go.

“I won’t lose you,” she whispered, her voice breaking, her fingers trembling as she held onto him. **“Not again.”**

---

The cabin shuddered violently, the walls cracking, the floor splintering beneath her as the Pulse pressed in, suffocating the air, pulling everything into its grip.

Sari’s breath came in short, ragged gasps as she looked down at Talon’s still form, her heart pounding. **He was gone.**

The darkness had taken him, and now it was coming for her.

But she wouldn’t let it win.

With a cry, Sari forced herself to her feet, her legs trembling beneath her. **She couldn’t stay here.** The Pulse was closing in, the walls of the cabin groaning as they bent under the weight of its presence. But she couldn’t leave him, either.

“I won’t lose you,” she whispered again, her voice raw with emotion.

With one last burst of strength, **she pulled Talon into her arms**, his body heavy and limp. Her muscles screamed in protest, her lungs burning with every

 breath, but she didn’t stop. **She couldn’t stop.**

The Pulse howled in protest, the air thick with its presence, but Sari pushed forward, her heart racing, her mind reeling. **She wasn’t leaving him behind.**

Not now. **Not ever.**
