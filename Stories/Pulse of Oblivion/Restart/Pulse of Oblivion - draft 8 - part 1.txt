**Preface: The Pulse**

---

Talon’s breath was ragged, shallow, the rhythm of his heart syncing with the earth beneath him. 

**Thump-thump.**

He was running—*again*—but the pulse had already crawled inside him, winding through his bones, sinking its claws into his chest. The darkness was closing in, the forest swallowing him whole. There was no sky anymore, no stars, just an endless stretch of black, thick as oil. His flashlight flickered, a weak beam of light that barely held back the shadows.

“Sari,” he gasped, reaching out into the dark, but there was nothing—just the pulse. Louder now, deeper.

**Thump-thump.**

The ground shifted beneath his feet, sinking, sagging, pulling him down. His legs were heavy, too heavy, as if the pulse was dragging him toward it. Heat surged up from the ground, searing through his boots, scorching the air. He couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t see. All he could feel was the pulse, inside him, around him, *consuming* him.

In the distance—just beyond the edge of his vision—he saw it. Something moved. A shadow. A shape. Warped and twisted, like smoke, like nothing he could understand. But it was there, waiting, watching.

**Thump-thump.**

It was getting closer.

And then he heard it—her voice. Barely a whisper, faint, so distant he could hardly make it out.

“Talon…”

He turned, desperate, his eyes straining against the black, but the pulse was drowning everything out. The darkness pressed in, thick and suffocating, and he couldn’t tell if it was coming from the forest, or from inside him.

“Sari,” he whispered, but she was already gone.

The pulse… the pulse was all that was left.

---

 **Chapter 1: Into the Forest**

---

The air was still. Too still. 

Sari could feel it pressing against her skin, thick and heavy, like the world was holding its breath. No wind, no birds, no rustling leaves—just the silence, stretching out in all directions, deep and unnatural. It felt like the forest itself was watching them.

“Talon, I don’t like this,” she muttered, her voice barely cutting through the stillness. She glanced over her shoulder, her grip tightening around the flashlight. “Something’s wrong.”

Talon didn’t answer. He was a few paces ahead, his flashlight beam slicing through the trees. His face was tense, eyes focused on the path in front of him. He’d been like this since they arrived—quiet, distant, as if he was already miles away from her.

“Talon.” She caught up to him, her breath shallow. “Did you hear me? We should turn back.”

“I heard you,” he said, his voice flat. “But we’re not turning back.”

Sari felt her pulse quicken, a knot of unease tightening in her chest. “Why are we even here? What are you looking for?”

Talon stopped, his eyes scanning the trees. He was silent for a moment, and when he finally spoke, his voice was low, almost a whisper. “You feel it, don’t you?”

Sari’s stomach churned. She didn’t want to admit it, but yes—she felt it. The strange warmth beneath her feet, the weight in the air. It was like the forest itself was *alive*, breathing beneath them.

“This is what we came for,” Talon said, his voice tight. “This is what I need to see.”

“What *you* need to see?” She crossed her arms, her eyes narrowing. “You dragged me out here because you need to prove something to yourself?”

Talon turned to her, his face hard, eyes shadowed by the fading light. “I didn’t drag you anywhere. You chose to come.”

Sari felt a sting in her chest at the coldness in his voice. “Yeah, because I didn’t want you running off alone again. After what happened last time—”

“That was different,” Talon snapped, cutting her off. His voice was sharp, defensive. “This isn’t like last time.”

“Isn’t it?” Sari’s voice softened, her anger giving way to fear. “You’ve been chasing this—*thing*—for months. Ever since… ever since that night. And you’re not telling me why.”

Talon’s jaw tightened. “I can’t—”

“*Why?*” Sari’s voice cracked, the frustration bubbling to the surface. “Why can’t you just tell me what’s going on? Why we’re here? Why I’m standing in the middle of the damn woods with you?”

“Because you wouldn’t understand,” Talon said, his voice low and cold.

“Try me.”

Talon exhaled, his shoulders sagging for a moment, and when he spoke, his voice was softer, quieter. “It’s real, Sari. The pulse. I’ve felt it before. And I can’t explain it… but it’s pulling me back here. It’s like it’s inside me, and I can’t… I can’t stop it.”

Sari stared at him, her heart pounding in her chest. She wanted to tell him he was wrong, that he was just chasing ghosts, but she could see the fear in his eyes. The pulse. She had heard the rumors, the whispers, but she had never really believed it. Not until now.

“I’m not letting you do this alone,” she whispered.

Talon looked at her, his expression softening for the first time since they arrived. “You don’t have to be here. You can leave if you want.”

Sari hesitated, her throat tightening. She could leave. She *should* leave. But she didn’t move.

“I’m not leaving you,” she said, her voice firm.

They stood there in silence for a moment, the tension between them crackling like static. The air was growing thicker, the warmth in the ground more pronounced. Sari could feel the weight of the forest pressing down on them, the silence growing heavier, more suffocating.

“We should keep moving,” Talon said finally, his voice tight. He started walking again, his flashlight beam cutting through the trees. Sari followed, her heartbeat syncing with the quiet thrum beneath her feet. She didn’t know where they were going, or what they would find, but the feeling of unease was growing stronger with every step.

And then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw it.

A flicker of movement. A shadow, shifting between the trees.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon stopped, his eyes narrowing as he followed her gaze. The shadow was there, moving just beyond the reach of their flashlights. It was too fast, too fluid, like it wasn’t really there. But it was. Sari could feel it.

“We need to go,” she said, her voice trembling.

“No.” Talon’s voice was firm, his jaw clenched. “We need to see it.”

Sari’s pulse quickened, her heart pounding in her chest. She could feel the heat rising from the ground, could hear the faint hum of something… *alive*.

“Talon, please—”

“It’s too late,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “It’s already here.”

Absolutely! With the new structure in place—starting with the mysterious and suspenseful preface, followed by the character-focused buildup in Chapter 1—the flow of the story has shifted. The next chapter (formerly Chapter 2, but now Chapter 3) needs to build on the emotional tension between Talon and Sari while diving deeper into the pulse’s presence and danger. 

This chapter will need to continue raising the stakes, transitioning from subtle foreshadowing to direct confrontation with the supernatural threat. Let’s keep the eerie, atmospheric tone while pushing both the internal and external conflicts further.

---

 **Chapter 2: The Pulse Stirs**

---

The pulse was stronger now.

Sari could feel it. Every step she took seemed heavier, like the ground was pulling her in, dragging her deeper into the forest. Her breath was shallow, her chest tight. The warmth under her feet was rising, spreading up her legs, into her bones. 

She didn’t want to think about what Talon had said—*I’ve felt it before.* She had never truly believed him. Not until now.

“This isn’t right,” Sari muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. She glanced over at Talon, who was walking just ahead, his shoulders rigid, his flashlight beam flickering weakly in the growing dark. “We shouldn’t be here.”

Talon didn’t respond. His eyes were fixed ahead, his jaw set, his expression unreadable. He had been like this since they saw the shadow—focused, determined, like nothing else existed but the pulse.

Sari’s stomach churned. She could feel the tension between them, thicker than the air around them. It was always there, lurking beneath the surface, but now it was suffocating.

“You can still leave,” Talon said suddenly, his voice cutting through the silence. He didn’t turn to look at her, but his words were sharp, as if he knew exactly what she was thinking. “No one’s forcing you to stay.”

Sari clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. “I’m not leaving you.”

Talon didn’t answer. He kept walking, the beam of his flashlight cutting through the shadows.

Sari swallowed the lump in her throat. She wasn’t sure if she was more frustrated or scared. Maybe both. Talon was obsessed—*possessed*, almost—with finding whatever it was that had brought them here. The pulse. She didn’t understand it, didn’t want to understand it. All she knew was that it felt *wrong*. All of it.

“Talon, stop,” she said, grabbing his arm. He halted, his body tensing under her touch. “We need to turn back.”

“We can’t,” he said, his voice low and controlled. “We’re too close.”

“Close to what? You don’t even know what’s out here!” Sari’s voice cracked, the fear bubbling to the surface. “We’ve been chasing shadows, Talon. And now… now you’re acting like—”

“Like what?” Talon turned to face her, his eyes cold, his voice tight. “Like I actually know what I’m doing?”

“No. Like you’re walking into something we can’t handle.” Sari’s breath hitched. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching them, something that was getting closer. “This isn’t just some experiment. This is real.”

Talon’s jaw clenched, but he didn’t respond. He turned away from her again, his eyes scanning the darkness. “I can feel it.”

Sari stared at him, her heart pounding in her chest. He looked different. Or maybe he was different. The Talon she knew—the one who had been reckless, yes, but never this cold, never this *detached*—was slipping away, and she didn’t know how to pull him back.

“Talon…” Sari’s voice softened, her anger fading into worry. “This isn’t about proving something to yourself anymore. This is about—”

Before she could finish, the ground shifted beneath her feet. 

It was subtle at first, like a tremor, but then it grew, rolling like a wave, the earth sagging under her boots. Sari gasped, stumbling forward, her hands flying out to catch her balance. The warmth beneath the ground flared, searing through her boots, burning her skin.

“Talon!” She reached out for him, her voice trembling, but he didn’t move. He was standing still, his head tilted slightly, his eyes wide. “Talon, what the hell is happening?!”

“The pulse…” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “It’s here.”

Sari’s stomach dropped. She could feel it now—*really* feel it. The pulse wasn’t just beneath them. It was *in* the ground, in the air, in her bones. It was everywhere.

**Thump-thump.**

The sound was deep, reverberating through the earth, through her body. Her heartbeat synced with it, faster and faster, until she couldn’t tell where her own pulse ended and the pulse began.

“Talon, we need to move. Now.”

But Talon wasn’t listening. He was staring into the darkness, his eyes unfocused, his breath shallow. The ground shifted again, harder this time, the earth beneath them rippling like water. Sari stumbled, her flashlight slipping from her hand and rolling into the undergrowth.

“Talon!” She grabbed his arm, shaking him. “We need to go. *Now*!”

Talon blinked, his eyes snapping back to hers. For a moment, he looked confused, lost, like he didn’t know where he was. But then the coldness returned, and he pulled his arm free from her grip.

“We’re close,” he muttered, his voice distant. “I can feel it.”

Sari felt a chill run down her spine. She didn’t know what was happening, but she knew one thing for sure—they needed to get out of there.

“We need to leave,” she said, her voice firm, even though her heart was pounding in her chest. “Talon, this isn’t—”

And then she saw it.

A shadow, flickering between the trees, just out of reach. It was moving fast, too fast to be anything human. But it wasn’t just a shadow. It was *something more*. Something that twisted and shifted, like smoke, like a nightmare made real.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, she couldn’t move. The pulse was louder now, almost deafening, the ground beneath her feet trembling with its force.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “There’s something—”

“I know,” he said, cutting her off. “I see it too.”

The shadow shifted again, closer this time, its form warping and twisting, as if the darkness itself was alive. Sari’s stomach twisted, her legs trembling. She wanted to run, to turn and bolt out of the forest, but her feet were glued to the ground.

And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the shadow was gone.

Sari gasped, her heart hammering in her chest. She turned to Talon, her hands shaking. “We need to go. Right now.”

Talon didn’t move. He was staring at the spot where the shadow had been, his face pale, his eyes wide. “It’s too late,” he whispered, his voice hollow. “We can’t leave now.”

Sari’s pulse quickened, fear twisting in her gut. “What do you mean we can’t leave?”

Talon’s gaze snapped to hers, and for the first time since they had arrived, Sari saw something in his eyes that terrified her more than the pulse or the shadows.

Resignation.

---

Let’s continue the suspense and emotional tension with Chapter 3, where the pulse’s influence becomes even stronger and more dangerous. Talon and Sari will face increasingly unsettling experiences as they delve deeper into the forest and the pulse begins to take its toll on their minds and bodies. We’ll deepen the external and internal conflict, heighten the danger, and start unraveling more of the mystery behind the pulse.

---

 **Chapter 3: The Shadows Within**

---

The pulse was changing.

It wasn’t just a steady rhythm beneath their feet anymore. It was shifting, growing louder, deeper, as if the earth itself was breathing. Sari felt it in her chest, her heartbeat quickening to match the pulse’s rhythm. The warmth beneath the ground had turned into heat—intense and burning, like the forest was alive and angry.

“Do you hear that?” Talon’s voice was low, tight. He had stopped walking, his flashlight beam trembling in the thick darkness ahead. His hand gripped the handle tighter, and Sari noticed how pale his knuckles had become.

“Hear what?” she whispered, her voice barely cutting through the heavy air. Her heart pounded in her chest, her skin prickling with a cold sweat. 

“The whispers,” Talon said, his gaze fixed on the trees. “They’re getting louder.”

Sari froze, straining to hear what he was talking about, but all she could hear was the deep, relentless **thump-thump** of the pulse in her ears. She opened her mouth to argue, to tell him that there was nothing, that they were alone out here. But then she heard it too.

A faint, almost imperceptible murmur—just on the edge of her hearing. Soft, like wind rustling through the leaves. But there was no wind. The air was still, heavy, like the forest was suffocating under the weight of the pulse.

Sari’s pulse quickened. She swallowed hard, her throat dry. “Talon… I don’t like this.”

“It’s them,” Talon said quietly, his voice distant, like he wasn’t fully there. His eyes were wide, unfocused, and his face had grown paler in the dim light. “They’re close. The ones who didn’t make it. They’re here.”

Sari felt her stomach drop. “What the hell are you talking about?”

Talon didn’t answer right away. He took a step forward, his hand trembling as he moved his flashlight across the path. His eyes followed something unseen, something only he could sense.

“We’re not alone,” he muttered. “They’re trying to warn us. Or… maybe they’re trying to stop us.”

Sari’s blood ran cold. She took a step back, her foot catching on a root. “Stop us from what?”

Talon stopped moving, his flashlight beam flickering as he lowered it toward the ground. His voice was barely a whisper. “From going any further.”

Sari felt a rush of panic, her breathing shallow. Her mind raced, trying to make sense of what was happening, but it was like everything had turned upside down. Talon wasn’t making sense, and she didn’t understand what he was hearing. 

But the pulse. The pulse was changing too.

It wasn’t just a rhythm anymore. It was louder, more insistent, like it was pulling at them, dragging them deeper into the forest. Her skin burned where her boots touched the ground, and she could feel the heat radiating up her legs, creeping into her bones.

“We need to leave,” she said, her voice trembling. “This is—this isn’t normal. We’re not supposed to be here.”

Talon didn’t move. His eyes were fixed on something in the distance, beyond the reach of his flashlight. His breath was shallow, his lips moving as if he was talking to someone she couldn’t see.

“We can’t leave,” he whispered. “Not yet.”

“Talon,” Sari said, her voice shaking. “Please. This is—this is wrong. We have to go. We have to—”

Before she could finish, the ground beneath them shook violently, a deep rumble tearing through the forest. Sari gasped, stumbling backward as the earth rolled like a wave beneath her feet. The pulse pounded in her chest, faster now, harder, like a heartbeat out of control. 

“Talon!” she cried out, her voice drowned out by the deep, vibrating hum of the pulse. She reached for him, but her hand caught nothing but empty air.

The ground shifted again, harder this time. Sari’s legs buckled, and she fell, her hands scraping against the rough, burning earth. Pain shot through her palms, but she barely felt it over the roar of the pulse. It was everywhere now—in the ground, in the air, in her mind.

**Thump-thump.**

**Thump-thump.**

It was inside her. Wrapping around her heart, her lungs, her thoughts. She could feel it pulsing through her veins, twisting through her muscles, pulling her closer to the earth.

“Get up,” she whispered to herself, her breath ragged. “Get up, Sari. You have to move.”

But she couldn’t. Her body felt heavy, weighed down by the pulse, like it was sinking into the ground. Her fingers clawed at the dirt, trying to pull herself up, but her arms trembled with the effort.

Then she saw it again.

The shadow.

It was moving between the trees, flickering at the edge of her vision. It wasn’t just a shadow—it was something else, something more. It twisted and warped, shifting like smoke, but with a form that was almost human. Almost, but not quite.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. She froze, her body trembling as the shadow moved closer. It didn’t make a sound, but she could feel it. The pulse grew louder, stronger, as if the shadow was connected to it. As if it *was* the pulse.

“No,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “This isn’t real. This isn’t—”

The shadow shifted, and for a moment, she thought she saw a face. Pale and twisted, the features stretched and distorted, like something trying to break free from the darkness.

Sari gasped, her hands flying to her mouth. Her heart pounded in her chest, faster and faster, until she couldn’t hear anything but the pulse.

**Thump-thump.**

The shadow moved closer, its form shifting and warping as it approached. The air around it seemed to bend and ripple, as if reality itself was being pulled apart. 

And then it stopped. 

Sari stared at it, her breath shallow, her body trembling. The pulse had gone silent. The ground had stopped shaking. The heat beneath her had vanished, replaced by an eerie, suffocating cold.

The shadow stood just a few feet away, its form still flickering, but more solid now. More real. 

She could see its face. The twisted features. The empty eyes.

“No,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “This isn’t real. This isn’t happening.”

But the shadow didn’t move. It just stood there, staring at her with those hollow, empty eyes.

And then, slowly, it reached out toward her.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. She tried to move, to scream, but her body wouldn’t respond. The pulse was gone, but she could feel it still, lurking beneath the surface, waiting.

The shadow’s hand was inches away from her now, its fingers twisted and broken, like branches from a dead tree. Sari’s heart raced, her body trembling with fear.

And then, just as the shadow’s fingers brushed against her skin, she heard it.

“Talon!”

Sari’s head snapped up, her heart pounding in her chest. She turned toward the voice—toward the sound of someone calling out in the distance.

“Talon!” The voice was closer now, louder. Familiar.

Sari’s pulse quickened. It was a woman’s voice. She was sure of it. But she didn’t recognize it.

The shadow froze, its twisted fingers hovering inches from her skin. Sari’s breath hitched as she looked back at it, her mind racing.

“Talon…” The voice was fainter now, almost drowned out by the silence.

The shadow withdrew, its form flickering again, and for a moment, Sari thought it would disappear.

But it didn’t. 

Instead, it turned, slowly, and began to move away, back into the trees, back into the darkness.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she watched it go, her body frozen with fear. She didn’t move until the shadow was gone, until the pulse returned, faint at first, but growing stronger with every second.

She gasped for breath, her body trembling. The pulse was back. But the shadow was gone.

And then, from somewhere deep within the forest, she heard it again.

The voice.

“Talon…”

Great! Let’s keep building on the momentum we've established, ensuring consistency with the earlier chapters and incorporating the changes from the feedback loop. I’ll generate **Chapters 4, 5, and 6** with the goal of maintaining tension, deepening the characters' emotional and psychological arcs, and escalating the external threats from the pulse and the shadow. We'll aim to hit 9.5 or higher on every editorial question across these new chapters.

---

**Chapter 4: Deeper into the Dark**

---

The pulse was relentless now. 

Sari’s steps faltered as they pushed deeper into the forest, the oppressive heat rising from the earth like an invisible tide. Every breath burned in her chest, the weight of the air pressing down on her like she was moving through water. Talon’s flashlight was still cutting through the thick, smoky darkness, but it felt like they weren’t making any progress. 

“We need to stop,” Sari said, her voice ragged. She grabbed at Talon’s arm, her fingers trembling as they wrapped around his sleeve. “Talon, we’re going in circles.”

“We can’t stop,” Talon muttered, shaking her hand off without even looking back at her. His voice was tight, strained, and his eyes were fixed ahead, where the shadows seemed to be shifting just beyond the reach of their light. “We’re close. I can feel it.”

Sari swallowed hard, her throat dry. She could feel it too, the pulse, throbbing through the ground and into her bones. But what Talon saw in the distance—what he was chasing—remained invisible to her. Only shadows, always moving, always just out of reach. 

“We’re not going to make it,” she whispered, half to herself. “We should’ve turned back.”

Talon stopped abruptly, and for a moment, Sari thought he’d finally heard her. But when he turned, his face was pale, his eyes wide with something she couldn’t quite place—fear, or maybe something worse. 

“Do you hear that?” he asked, his voice barely audible.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. She strained her ears, but all she could hear was the soft **thump-thump** of the pulse, echoing through the ground, through the trees, through her body. “What is it?”

Talon didn’t answer. He took a step forward, his flashlight beam flickering as he moved it slowly across the path. His breath quickened, his eyes darting from shadow to shadow.

“It’s closer,” he whispered. “The pulse… it’s changing.”

Sari’s stomach twisted. She wanted to run, wanted to pull Talon back, but her legs wouldn’t move. She was rooted to the ground, the pulse wrapping around her feet, holding her in place. 

“We need to go,” she said, her voice trembling. “Talon, we need to leave.”

But Talon wasn’t listening. His focus was entirely on the darkness ahead, where the shadows were gathering, shifting like smoke. He took another step forward, then another.

And then he stopped.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she followed his gaze. At first, she couldn’t see anything—just the endless dark. But then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw it. A shape. Flickering. Moving.

It was different from before. Bigger. More solid.

“What… what is that?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon didn’t answer. He was frozen in place, his breath shallow, his eyes wide. 

The shadow moved again, closer this time. It wasn’t like the flickering shapes they’d seen before. This one was… real. Solid. 

Alive.

Sari’s heart raced. She could feel the pulse quickening beneath her feet, the ground shifting, sagging, as if the earth itself was reacting to the presence of whatever this was. 

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “Please, we have to go.”

Talon didn’t move. His eyes were locked on the shape as it stepped into the edge of their flashlight beam. Sari gasped, her breath catching in her throat. It wasn’t human—not anymore. Its form was twisted, warped, its features distorted as though the pulse had reshaped it into something new. Something monstrous.

And then it spoke.

“You shouldn’t be here.”

Sari’s blood ran cold. The voice was low, hollow, as though it was coming from deep within the ground. Talon’s breath hitched, his body trembling as he took a step back.

“We need to run,” Sari said, her voice trembling. “Now.”

But before she could move, the ground shifted violently beneath them. The heat surged upward, scorching the air, and the pulse grew louder, faster, until it was all she could hear. **Thump-thump. Thump-thump.** It was deafening, drowning out everything else.

The shadow took another step forward, its twisted, distorted body moving in unnatural jerks. Its eyes—if they were eyes—were hollow, empty, like two pits of darkness.

“You’ve come too far,” it whispered, its voice rumbling through the air like thunder. “Now you can never leave.”

Sari’s body moved before her mind could process what was happening. She grabbed Talon’s arm and yanked him back, her feet slipping on the soft, burning earth. “Run!”

Talon didn’t resist. For the first time, he didn’t argue, didn’t push forward. He turned and ran, his breath coming in short, sharp bursts. Sari followed, her heart pounding in her chest, the pulse still roaring in her ears.

But the shadow followed them.

They ran through the forest, the trees blurring together, the ground shifting and rolling beneath them like waves. The pulse was everywhere, in the air, in the ground, in their bodies. And the shadow was right behind them, moving faster, closer, with every step they took.

“We can’t outrun it,” Talon gasped, his voice ragged. “We have to—”

Before he could finish, the ground collapsed beneath him.

“Talon!” Sari screamed, skidding to a stop as Talon disappeared into the earth. She scrambled to the edge of the pit, her heart hammering in her chest. The hole was deep, dark, the pulse louder than ever as it echoed up from below.

“Talon!” she shouted, her voice trembling. “Talon, are you okay?”

There was no response. Just the pulse, louder, faster, drowning out everything else.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. She couldn’t see him. The darkness was too thick, too deep. And the shadow was getting closer.

Without thinking, she lowered herself into the hole, her feet sliding on the soft, burning earth. The heat was unbearable, scorching her skin, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop. Talon was down there, somewhere.

As she descended into the pit, the pulse grew louder, deeper, vibrating through the walls of the earth. The shadows shifted around her, flickering in and out of existence, like they were watching her, waiting.

And then she saw him.

Talon was lying at the bottom of the pit, his body still, his eyes closed. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she dropped to her knees beside him, her hands shaking.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Talon, please. Wake up.”

He didn’t move.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. The pulse was deafening now, pounding through her body, shaking the ground beneath her. The shadows were closing in, the heat pressing down on her like a weight.

“Talon,” she whispered again, her voice barely audible. She reached out, her fingers trembling as she touched his shoulder.

And then, slowly, Talon’s eyes opened.

But they weren’t his eyes anymore.

---

 **Chapter 5: The Pulse Takes Hold**

---

Talon’s eyes were hollow. Empty. 

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat as she stared down at him. His body was still, but his eyes… there was something wrong. Something missing.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Please… say something.”

But he didn’t speak. He just stared up at her, his face expressionless, his eyes cold. The pulse was deafening now, pounding through the ground, through her body, through her mind. **Thump-thump. Thump-thump.** It was everywhere, filling the pit, vibrating through the walls.

Sari’s hands shook as she reached for him, her fingers trembling. She needed to pull him out of here, to get him away from the pulse, from the shadows, from whatever had taken hold of him.

But as soon as her fingers brushed against his skin, Talon’s hand shot up and grabbed her wrist.

Sari gasped, her heart pounding in her chest. His grip was cold, unyielding, like iron. She tried to pull away, but he held on tight, his eyes locked on hers.

“You can’t leave,” he whispered, his voice low, hollow. “You’re part of this now.”

Sari’s blood ran cold. “What… what are you talking about? Talon, we need to go. We need to—”

“You’ve felt it, haven’t you?” Talon’s voice was soft, almost gentle, but there was something off about it. Something wrong. “The pulse. It’s inside you now. Just like it’s inside me.”

Sari shook her head, her breath coming in short, sharp bursts. “No. No, I—”

“The pulse has chosen us,” Talon said, his grip tightening. “We’re part

 of it now. There’s no going back.”

Sari’s stomach twisted. She could feel the pulse in her chest, in her veins, in her mind. It was everywhere, wrapping around her like a vice, squeezing tighter and tighter with every beat.

But she couldn’t let it take her. She couldn’t.

“Talon, listen to me,” she said, her voice shaking. “We can fight this. We can get out of here. But we have to go. Right now.”

Talon’s eyes flickered, just for a moment, and for the briefest second, Sari thought she saw something—recognition, fear, something human. But then it was gone, replaced by the cold, empty stare of someone who had already given up.

“You don’t understand,” Talon whispered. “The pulse… it’s everything. It’s part of us now. It’s who we are.”

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest. She could feel the pulse tightening around her, pulling her deeper into the ground, into the heat, into the darkness. But she couldn’t let it take her. She wouldn’t.

With a burst of strength, she yanked her wrist free from Talon’s grip and scrambled to her feet. The pulse roared in her ears, vibrating through the ground, through her bones, but she forced herself to move, to climb out of the pit.

“Talon!” she shouted, her voice cracking as she reached the top. “I’m not leaving you!”

But he didn’t move. He just lay there, staring up at her, his eyes hollow, his face expressionless.

And then the ground shook.

Sari stumbled, her hands flying out to catch her balance as the earth shifted beneath her feet. The pulse was deafening now, roaring through the forest, through the trees, through the ground. The shadows were closing in, flickering and twisting like smoke.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. She couldn’t stay here. She couldn’t stay in the pit. The pulse was taking over. It was taking Talon, and it would take her too if she didn’t move.

With a final, desperate glance at Talon, Sari turned and ran.

 **Chapter 6: The Forest of Shadows**

Sari’s legs burned as she ran through the forest, the pulse still roaring in her ears. The ground shifted beneath her feet, the heat rising in waves, making every step harder than the last. But she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop.

The shadows were everywhere now, flickering between the trees, twisting and warping like living things. They weren’t just following her—they were surrounding her, closing in, blocking her path at every turn. The pulse was in them too. She could feel it, vibrating through the air, through the ground, through her body.

“Please,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Please, let me go.”

But there was no answer. Only the pulse. **Thump-thump. Thump-thump.**

Sari’s breath came in short, sharp bursts as she pushed forward, her heart pounding in her chest. She didn’t know where she was going. She didn’t know if there was anywhere left to go. All she knew was that she had to keep moving.

But then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw it.

A light.

Faint, barely visible through the thick trees, but it was there. A flicker of hope in the darkness.

Sari’s heart leaped in her chest. She turned toward the light, her legs trembling as she forced herself to move faster, to push through the pain, through the heat, through the pulse.

The light grew brighter as she approached, cutting through the darkness like a beacon. Sari’s breath hitched in her throat as she stumbled forward, her hands reaching out toward the light.

But when she broke through the trees and into the clearing, she stopped dead in her tracks.

The light wasn’t what she thought it was.

It wasn’t a beacon. It wasn’t a sign of safety.

It was a fire. A massive, roaring fire, burning in the center of the clearing, its flames licking at the sky, casting long, twisted shadows across the ground.

And standing in front of the fire, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames, were people.

Dozens of them.

But they weren’t people. Not anymore.

Their bodies were twisted, distorted, just like the shadow she and Talon had seen earlier. Their faces were hollow, their eyes empty, their skin charred and blackened by the flames.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she took a step back, her breath trembling. The pulse was louder than ever now, vibrating through the ground, through her bones, through her mind.

And then, one by one, the twisted figures turned to face her.

**Chapter 7: The Circle of Flames**

---

The fire blazed, casting long, twisting shadows across the clearing. The heat was oppressive, pressing down on Sari like a physical weight. She stood frozen at the edge of the clearing, her breath coming in ragged gasps, her heart pounding in her chest.

The figures around the fire—dozens of them, their bodies twisted and burned—turned to face her. Their hollow eyes glinted in the flickering firelight, empty and lifeless, just like Talon’s had been.

“Sari…” The voice was unmistakable, even though it was faint, distorted. It was Talon.

Her breath caught in her throat. “Talon?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

One of the figures, taller than the others, stepped forward. Its body was blackened and charred, its skin cracked and peeling. But its eyes—those empty, hollow eyes—were fixed on her. 

“Sari…” the figure whispered again, and this time, there was no mistaking it. It *was* Talon’s voice.

Sari’s heart raced as she took a step back, her entire body trembling. “No… no, this isn’t real. This isn’t—”

But the figure took another step toward her, its hand reaching out. “You can’t leave,” it said, its voice a low, guttural whisper. “We’re part of it now. We all are.”

Sari’s pulse quickened. The ground beneath her feet was vibrating, pulsing in rhythm with her own heartbeat. The heat from the fire was unbearable, scorching her skin, but she couldn’t move. She couldn’t look away from the figure—*from Talon*—as it drew closer.

“This isn’t real,” she whispered again, her voice trembling. “This can’t be happening.”

But the pulse was there, inside her, wrapping around her heart, squeezing tighter with every beat. She could feel it now, more than ever. It was in the ground, in the air, in her blood. It was consuming her.

“You feel it, don’t you?” the figure whispered, its voice soft, insidious. “The pulse. It’s inside you too.”

Sari shook her head, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. “No. No, I—”

“You can’t fight it,” the figure said, its hand almost touching her now. “It’s part of you. It’s part of everything.”

Sari’s stomach twisted. She wanted to run, to scream, to fight back, but her body wouldn’t listen. The pulse was too strong, too overwhelming. It was dragging her down, pulling her deeper into the darkness.

And then, just as the figure’s hand brushed against her skin, Sari’s instincts kicked in.

She lashed out, her hands connecting with the figure’s chest, shoving it backward with all the strength she could muster. The figure stumbled, its body jerking awkwardly as it tried to regain its balance.

Sari didn’t wait. She turned and ran, her legs trembling beneath her, her breath ragged. The pulse was still pounding in her ears, louder than ever, but she forced herself to move, to keep running.

Behind her, she could hear the figures stirring, their footsteps heavy and unsteady as they followed her. She didn’t look back. She couldn’t. All she could do was run.

The trees closed in around her as she sprinted through the forest, the ground shifting and rolling beneath her feet. The pulse was still there, still pulling at her, but she fought against it with every step.

She didn’t know where she was going. She didn’t know if there was anywhere left to go. But she couldn’t stop. She wouldn’t stop.

Not until she was free.

**Chapter 8: Echoes of the Pulse**

---

Sari’s breath came in ragged gasps as she pushed through the dense underbrush, her heart pounding in her chest. The shadows flickered at the edge of her vision, twisting and warping like smoke, but she kept moving. She had to keep moving.

The pulse was relentless now, thrumming through the ground, through the trees, through her bones. It was louder than ever, shaking the earth beneath her feet, vibrating through her body. She could feel it, deep inside her, wrapping around her heart, her lungs, her mind.

But she wasn’t going to let it win. She couldn’t.

Sari stumbled over a root, her foot catching in the uneven ground. She fell, her hands scraping against the rough earth as she hit the ground hard. Pain shot through her palms, but she barely felt it over the roar of the pulse.

She lay there for a moment, gasping for breath, her entire body trembling. The pulse was still there, pounding in her ears, shaking the ground beneath her. But something else was there too—something deeper, something more.

A voice.

Faint, distant, but unmistakable. 

“Sari…”

Her heart stopped. She knew that voice.

“Talon?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The voice didn’t answer. But it was there, somewhere in the distance, echoing through the forest.

Sari pushed herself to her feet, her legs shaking beneath her. “Talon?” she called out again, her voice trembling. “Where are you?”

There was no answer. But the voice was there. She knew it. She could feel it.

Sari stumbled forward, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The forest seemed to close in around her, the trees warping and twisting under the influence of the pulse. The ground was shifting again, the earth rolling beneath her feet like waves.

But she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop.

“Talon!” she shouted, her voice cracking. “Please… answer me!”

The pulse grew louder, more insistent, pounding through her body, through her mind. The shadows flickered and twisted around her, but she ignored them. She had to find him. She had to—

There.

Up ahead, through the trees, she saw it. A figure, standing motionless in the distance, its body barely visible through the thick undergrowth.

Sari’s heart leaped in her chest. “Talon!”

She pushed forward, her legs trembling, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The pulse was deafening now, drowning out everything else, but she didn’t care. She had to reach him. She had to—

But when she broke through the trees and into the clearing, she stopped dead in her tracks.

It wasn’t Talon.

It was one of them.

The twisted figures she had seen at the fire. Its body was blackened and charred, its skin cracked and peeling. Its hollow eyes glinted in the dim light, empty and lifeless.

Sari’s stomach twisted. She tried to back away, but her legs wouldn’t move. The pulse was too strong. It was pulling her in, dragging her down.

And then, just as the figure took a step toward her, it spoke.

“You can’t escape.”

**Chapter 9: Convergence**

---

The forest was suffocating, the air thick with heat and smoke. The pulse was everywhere now—thundering in her ears, shaking the ground beneath her feet, wrapping around her like a vice.

Sari stood frozen, her heart pounding in her chest, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The figure—the twisted, charred figure—was moving closer, its hollow eyes fixed on hers.

“You can’t escape,” it said again, its voice low and guttural.

Sari’s stomach lurched. “No,” she whispered, shaking her head. “No, I can. I will.”

The figure tilted its head, its empty eyes glinting in the dim light. “You’re part of it now. You always have been.”

Sari’s heart raced. “That’s not true,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I’m not like you.”

The figure took another step forward, its twisted body jerking unnaturally as it moved. “The pulse is inside you,” it said. “It’s inside all of us. There’s no escape.”

Sari’s hands clenched into fists at her sides. She could feel the pulse tightening around her, squeezing the breath from her lungs, but she fought against it with everything she had. She wasn’t going to let it take her. She wasn’t going to let it win.

“No,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “You’re wrong.”

The figure stopped, its head tilting again, as if it was considering her words. Then, slowly, it raised its hand, pointing toward the trees behind her.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat. She didn’t want to turn around. She didn’t want to see what was there. But she had to.

Slowly, hesitantly, she turned.

And there, standing at the edge of the clearing, was another figure. This one was different from the others—its body was whole, its skin unburned. But its eyes… its eyes were hollow, empty.

It was Talon.

Sari’s heart stopped. “Talon?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

He didn’t answer.

 He just stood there, his eyes fixed on hers, his body motionless.

“Talon, please,” Sari whispered, taking a step toward him. “Please, tell me this isn’t real.”

But he didn’t move. He didn’t speak.

And then, slowly, he raised his hand, pointing toward the fire.

Sari’s stomach twisted. The pulse was roaring in her ears, louder than ever, shaking the ground beneath her feet. She didn’t understand what was happening. She didn’t understand *why* this was happening.

But then Talon spoke.

“We’re all part of it now,” he whispered, his voice hollow. “There’s no escape.”

**Chapter 10: The Path of Shadows**

---

The shadows were relentless.

Sari stumbled through the forest, her breath ragged and her legs burning. The pulse was pounding through her chest, an insistent rhythm that refused to let her go. It wasn’t just in the ground anymore—it was in the air, in her blood, in her thoughts. Every step she took felt heavier, harder, as though the pulse was trying to drag her back.

“Talon!” she screamed, her voice barely audible over the roaring in her ears. She didn’t know if she was calling to him out of desperation or if she was begging for him to stop.

He was still there, somewhere behind her. The version of him that was no longer *him*. The version the pulse had stolen.

She had seen it in his eyes when he pointed to the fire—the hollow look, the emptiness that had replaced the man she knew. Sari’s heart twisted in her chest. Talon wasn’t just lost—he was *gone*.

The trees warped and twisted as she ran, the shadows stretching and bending unnaturally, as though the forest itself was alive. She could feel them closing in on her, the dark figures from the fire creeping closer, their hollow eyes watching, waiting.

She needed to find a way out. She needed to escape before it was too late.

But the pulse was everywhere. It was pulling at her, wrapping around her thoughts, clouding her mind. She could barely think anymore, barely breathe.

**Thump-thump. Thump-thump.**

It was getting louder. Closer.

Sari’s foot caught on a root, and she fell hard, her hands scraping against the rough earth. Pain shot through her palms, but she barely registered it. She lay there for a moment, gasping for breath, her body trembling from exhaustion and fear.

The pulse pounded in her ears, drowning out everything else. But beneath the deafening rhythm, she heard it—footsteps.

Slow. Deliberate.

Coming closer.

Sari’s breath hitched in her throat as she forced herself to her feet. She had to keep moving. She couldn’t let them catch her. She couldn’t let the pulse take her.

She stumbled forward, her legs trembling beneath her. The trees seemed to stretch endlessly ahead, warping and shifting as the pulse tore through the forest.

And then, suddenly, she heard it.

A voice.

Faint, distant, but unmistakable.

“Sari…”

Her heart froze.

It wasn’t Talon’s voice.

It was hers.

Sari turned, her breath catching in her throat. There, standing just a few feet behind her, was a figure. Twisted, blackened, its body cracked and charred like the others. Its hollow eyes glinted in the dim light.

But its face—it was her face.

The figure took a step toward her, its movements slow, unnatural.

“You can’t escape,” it whispered, its voice an eerie echo of her own. “The pulse is inside you. You’re already one of us.”

Sari’s pulse quickened. She stumbled back, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. “No… no, I’m not like you. I’m not—”

But the figure stepped closer, its hand outstretched. “You can’t run from it. You’re already part of it.”

Sari’s heart raced as she turned and bolted into the forest. The pulse was deafening now, roaring in her ears, shaking the ground beneath her feet. The figure’s voice echoed behind her, but she didn’t look back. She couldn’t.

She had to keep running.
