**Chapter 1: The Pulse Awakens**

The air itself seemed to tighten, clinging to every surface with an unnatural stillness. The stars above Brookridge, usually sharp and clear, were muted, receding into the night as if in retreat. Talon Mercer stood at his window, his hand resting on the barometer, the needle still as death. Something was coming—he could feel it—but the tools at his disposal offered no warnings. The tension in the atmosphere wasn't something that could be measured.

He exhaled slowly, watching his breath fog the glass. A faint, rhythmic hum seemed to vibrate beneath his feet, not loud enough to hear but tangible enough to make the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. It wasn’t just sound—it was a pressure, a force, threading its way through his bones. He didn’t know what it was, but the feeling burrowed under his skin, leaving him unsettled.

In the town square, Sari Greysun fumbled with the key to her antiques shop, her hands trembling slightly. She was used to quiet nights, but not like this. Tonight, Brookridge felt empty—too empty. She paused, her hand resting against the cold wood of the door, and for a moment, everything was silent. Then she felt it—a low, steady thrum, like a heartbeat buried deep beneath the earth. It pulsed in perfect time with her own, syncing so perfectly that it sent a shiver down her spine.

Her breath hitched, and she withdrew her hand as if the door had burned her. Sari pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders, casting a glance over her shoulder toward the deserted streets. She quickened her pace, every step in sync with the persistent hum beneath her feet, each beat seeming to follow her home. She didn’t know what it was, but it wasn’t something natural. It wasn’t right.

Across town, Dystiny Smith sat in her dimly lit apartment, neon markers scattered across the table as she drew chaotic strokes on a sheet of paper. The colors clashed, a reflection of the whirlwind inside her mind. She’d been restless all evening, the bright bursts of color doing little to soothe her. Tonight, something was wrong—she could feel it in the air, thick and suffocating.

She paused mid-stroke, her hand hovering above the paper. The apartment was eerily silent. Dystiny pulled her headphones out, but the silence pressed in, heavy and stifling. Her breath caught as a tremor vibrated through the floor, rattling the pencils on her desk. The vibration wasn’t violent, but it was steady, persistent, like a war drum in the distance, growing louder with each passing second.

She shot up from her seat, sending the markers scattering. Her heart raced as the pulse seemed to surge inside her, as if it was calling her, pulling her toward something unknown. She pressed her hand against the windowpane, feeling the cool glass beneath her palm. The pulse throbbed again, resonating through her bones, a rhythm she couldn’t shake.

Then came a sharp knock on her door, startling her back to reality. She jumped, her heart pounding. Who would be visiting at this hour?

---

At the other end of town, **Pastor Nathan O'Connell** knelt at the altar of St. Joseph’s Church, his hands clasped in fervent prayer. The flickering candlelight cast long, twisting shadows along the walls, dancing with the unnatural tension that filled the air. His dreams had been dark for weeks now, filled with ominous visions of shadows swallowing the town. He couldn’t help but feel that something was coming—something far beyond his understanding.

He ran his thumb along the worn leather of his Bible, the familiar weight offering no comfort this time. His voice trembled as he whispered, “Where is God in all of this?” He had never questioned his faith before, not like this. But now, standing at the edge of something he couldn’t name, he felt his prayers faltering.

Beneath his knees, the wooden floor of the church vibrated, a slow, rhythmic pulse like the heartbeat of something ancient stirring beneath the earth. It wasn’t just a sound—it was a pressure, building with every passing second. The walls seemed to shift in time with the beat, the old pews creaking as if alive.

Nathan stood abruptly, his hands trembling. Whatever this was, it wasn’t divine. The Virgin Mary’s image in the stained glass glowed eerily under the full moon’s light, but the pulse didn’t feel like a test of faith. It felt wrong. Dark. Something that had no place in God’s world.

His mind raced, and he turned toward the door. Whatever this was, he needed to warn the others. The town had to be prepared.

---

Talon stood at the edge of the woods, the barometer flickering wildly in his hand. The pulse had drawn him here, pulling him deeper into the forest like a moth to a flame. He wasn’t sure why he had followed it, but the air around him seemed alive with energy, crackling with something unseen.

He gripped the hunting knife at his belt, his eyes scanning the dense thicket. The vibration was growing stronger now, louder, more insistent. His breath came out in short gasps as he muttered, “What the hell is going on?”

A rustling behind him made him whirl around, knife raised instinctively. Sari stepped out from between the trees, her eyes wide and fearful.

“Did you feel it too?” she asked, breathless.

Talon nodded, his grip tightening on the knife. “It’s not natural.”

“No,” she agreed, glancing over her shoulder. “It’s... alive.”

Before they could say more, Dystiny appeared at the edge of the clearing, her face pale and drawn. She rubbed her arms, her eyes darting around as if she couldn’t trust what she was seeing.

“Do you feel like it’s pulling you?” she whispered. “Like it’s in your head?”

Sari shuddered, nodding. Talon clenched his jaw. Whatever this was, it wasn’t just affecting the ground beneath their feet—it was inside them, twisting their thoughts, pulling them toward something unknown.

“We need to figure out where it’s coming from,” Talon said, his voice low and steady, though his heart pounded in his chest.

From the shadows, **Pastor Nathan** emerged, his robes billowing in the sudden breeze. His face was pale, his eyes alight with conviction.

“This is a test,” he declared, his voice louder than it needed to be. “We must prepare ourselves. The Lord has sent us this challenge.”

“Or something else has,” Dystiny muttered, her voice edged with fear.

The group stood in uneasy silence as the pulse continued to thrum beneath them, growing stronger with every beat.

Brookridge was changing, and none of them knew how—or if—they would survive it.

Certainly! Here’s the rewritten version of **Chapter 2: Unsettling Changes** based on the enhancements:

**Chapter 2: Unsettling Changes **

The pulse didn’t stop. If anything, it grew more insistent as the night wore on, a steady, rhythmic thrum that seemed to pulse not just through the ground but through the air itself. By the time morning came, the town of Brookridge felt different—off-kilter in a way that Talon couldn’t put into words.

The sky was a pale, sickly color, too bright for the early hour, and the air was unnervingly still, as though the world itself was holding its breath. Talon rubbed his eyes and glanced at the barometer again, but the needle hadn’t budged. It was stuck, as if refusing to acknowledge what was happening.

Throwing on his jacket, he stepped outside. The pulse was still there, vibrating beneath his boots, a low hum that seemed to reverberate through his bones. It was growing stronger, more pronounced, but the town remained eerily quiet.

The town square, usually buzzing with morning activity, was deserted. No one was heading to the market, and the children who would normally be playing near the fountain were nowhere to be seen. The silence was heavy, unnatural. Talon felt it under his skin, an itch he couldn’t scratch.

Across the square, Sari stood at the door of her shop, her eyes unfocused as if she were miles away. She’d been awake all night, plagued by strange, vivid dreams that left her feeling as though she’d been somewhere else entirely—places she’d never been but could somehow almost remember. The pulse had been there too, whispering to her, pulling her deeper into the recesses of her own mind.

Talon approached her cautiously. “It’s worse,” he said, his voice barely louder than a whisper.

Sari didn’t look at him. She was still staring at the horizon, her hand absently brushing her hair out of her face. “I don’t know what’s happening, Talon. I feel... wrong. Like something’s inside me. I didn’t sleep at all. And the dreams... they don’t even feel like mine.”

Talon clenched his jaw. “I had them too. So did Dystiny.”

Sari shuddered, her arms wrapping tightly around herself. “This isn’t just us. It’s the whole town. It’s like... like the pulse is inside us now, not just outside.”

Just as she finished speaking, a low growl echoed from the alley behind her shop. Talon’s muscles tensed. He motioned for Sari to stay back as he crept toward the sound, his hand instinctively hovering over the knife at his belt.

What he saw made his stomach drop.

A stray dog, its fur matted and its eyes wild, staggered out of the shadows. Its movements were jerky, erratic, as if it were being pulled by invisible strings. Its mouth hung open, saliva dripping from its jaw, and its body convulsed with every step, as though the pulse had burrowed inside it, warping its very being.

“Jesus,” Talon muttered, backing away slowly.

The dog froze, its head snapping up to lock eyes with him. For a moment, they stood in tense silence, the pulse drumming louder and louder in Talon’s ears. The dog’s eyes, bloodshot and glazed, looked through him as if it didn’t recognize the world around it. Then, without warning, the dog bolted, disappearing into the shadows with a speed that defied its previous sluggishness.

Talon turned back to Sari, his face pale. “It’s affecting animals too,” he said quietly.

Sari swallowed hard, her hands trembling. “What do we do?”

“We find out where it’s coming from,” Talon replied, his voice firm, though inside, his heart was racing.

---

Dystiny was already awake when they arrived at her apartment. She hadn’t slept either. The pulse had taken root in her mind, filling it with fragmented images and flashes of half-formed thoughts that seemed to make no sense. She hadn’t been able to concentrate on anything except the ever-present hum, which was now a constant in her life, louder than her own heartbeat.

When she opened the door to Talon and Sari, her eyes were wide, manic. “You feel it too,” she said without preamble. It wasn’t a question.

Talon nodded. “We need to figure out what’s going on. It’s getting worse.”

Dystiny laughed, a short, sharp sound that held no humor. “Getting worse? It’s already broken everything. The pulse is... it’s inside me. I can’t think straight. I keep seeing things. Colors, shapes, memories that aren’t mine.” She gestured vaguely to the walls of her apartment, where her frantic drawings had taken over, neon lines crisscrossing haphazardly as though she had been trying to map the chaos inside her mind. “It’s like it’s in everything now. Not just the ground. Not just the air.”

Sari stepped forward, her voice soft with concern. “Dystiny, we’re all feeling it, but we have to stay focused. We need to understand what this thing is.”

“I’m *trying*,” Dystiny snapped, her hands shaking. “But it’s too much. Every time I close my eyes, I see... things. Things that don’t make sense.”

Talon folded his arms. “We’re all having the same dreams. This isn’t just coincidence. Whatever the pulse is, it’s in our heads now. It’s trying to tell us something—or control us.”

Dystiny’s manic energy seemed to falter for a moment. “Control us?” she whispered. “What does it want?”

Talon shook his head. “We don’t know yet. But we need to find out.”

Before anyone could respond, a loud crash echoed from outside. The three of them rushed to the window, their breath catching as they saw a group of people gathered in the town square. It wasn’t the usual morning crowd. They were shouting, pushing, their faces pale with fear. In the middle of the square, two men were grappling with each other, their movements frantic and violent. The rest of the crowd stood frozen, watching in stunned silence.

“It’s affecting them too,” Sari whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon’s expression hardened. “We need to get them inside before this gets worse.”

Dystiny grabbed her coat and followed them outside. As they approached the square, the scene became clearer. The pulse had intensified, warping people’s emotions, twisting their fears until they turned on each other. Some were shouting about divine punishment, others about government conspiracies, their voices frantic with desperation.

At the center of the chaos stood **Pastor Nathan**, his arms raised as if in prayer, trying to calm the crowd. But even from a distance, Talon could see the strain on his face, the cracks in his calm exterior.

“This is a test!” Pastor Nathan’s voice rang out over the din, his tone filled with conviction. “We must not give in to fear! The Lord is with us!”

But the crowd wasn’t listening. The pulse’s grip was too strong, feeding on their panic and uncertainty, turning the town square into a boiling pot of confusion and chaos.

Talon, Sari, and Dystiny pushed through the mass of bodies, trying to reach Pastor Nathan. “Father!” Sari called out, grabbing his arm. “We need to get everyone inside. It’s not safe out here.”

Pastor Nathan turned to her, his eyes wild with a mixture of fear and determination. “This is judgment, Sari. The pulse... it’s testing our faith.”

“No,” Talon interrupted, his voice sharp. “This isn’t divine. It’s in our heads. You can feel it, can’t you?”

The pastor shook his head stubbornly. “I refuse to believe that. The Lord does not abandon us in times of need.”

Before they could argue further, a piercing scream cut through the air. The crowd parted, revealing a woman stumbling forward, her hands covered in blood. Behind her, a man lay motionless on the ground, his head twisted at an unnatural angle.

The pulse had claimed its first victim.

For a moment, everything went silent. Then the square erupted into chaos.

Sari grabbed Dystiny’s arm, pulling her toward the safety of her shop. “We need to go!”

Talon’s mind raced as the pulse surged through him, almost deafening now. Whatever was happening to Brookridge, this was only the beginning.

---

**Chapter 3: The First Expedition**

The pulse hadn’t let up. If anything, it had only grown stronger, more insistent. By the time the sun rose, a heavy fog clung to the ground, as if the earth itself was trying to smother whatever malevolent force had taken root beneath Brookridge. It was early, too early for anyone to be awake, yet Talon, Sari, Dystiny, and Pastor Nathan found themselves gathered at the edge of the woods.

No one had spoken much since the incident in the square. The sight of the dead man had left a mark on all of them. Talon could still see his lifeless eyes staring into nothingness, his face frozen in a twisted scream. The memory gnawed at him, making the pulse’s rhythm seem louder, as if it were pulsing directly in his skull.

“We shouldn’t be here,” Sari whispered, pulling her coat tighter against the morning chill. Her breath hung in the air, lingering longer than it should have. “Not without a plan.”

Talon frowned but didn’t argue. She was right, but they had to do something. Waiting wasn’t an option anymore. “We need to figure out where this thing is coming from,” he said. “We’re running out of time.”

Pastor Nathan shifted uneasily, his gaze fixed on the fog-shrouded trees. He hadn’t been the same since last night. His faith had wavered, if only for a moment, and that doubt gnawed at him just as much as the pulse did. But he wouldn’t let it show. He had to stay strong, for their sake.

“We’re not alone in this,” Nathan said softly, his voice quieter than usual. “God is still with us, even if it feels... distant.”

Dystiny snorted but said nothing. She’d stopped arguing with Nathan’s insistence on divine intervention after the incident in the square. What good would it do? The pulse was far beyond anything human or divine. It was something else entirely.

Talon took the lead, his flashlight cutting a narrow path through the fog. The woods were unnervingly quiet, the usual sounds of birds and rustling leaves replaced by an oppressive silence. Each step felt heavier than the last, as though the ground itself resisted them. The pulse throbbed beneath their feet, more than just a sound now—it was a presence, coiled tight in the air, pressing down on them with invisible weight.

Dystiny trailed behind, her hand trailing along the trunks of the trees as if grounding herself. “It’s getting louder,” she murmured. “It’s pulling us.”

Talon glanced over his shoulder at her, his brow furrowed. “Pulling us where?”

She didn’t respond, but the far-off look in her eyes told him she knew something. Or maybe it was just the pulse messing with her head. It was hard to tell anymore. He didn’t trust his own thoughts either.

Sari suddenly stopped short, her eyes narrowing at something on the ground. “Wait.” She knelt, brushing aside the fallen leaves to reveal strange markings etched into the earth. They were faint, barely visible, but unmistakable.

“What is it?” Nathan asked, his hand resting on the worn leather of his Bible as if it could offer some protection from whatever they were about to face.

Sari traced the markings with her finger. “It’s old. Really old. These don’t look natural.”

Talon crouched beside her, his eyes scanning the symbols. He couldn’t make sense of them, but they felt wrong, like they didn’t belong here. He pressed his hand against the ground, half-expecting it to pulse beneath his palm, but all he felt was cold dirt.

“These are ancient,” Dystiny muttered from behind them. Her voice was distant, almost hollow. “This isn’t the first time something like this has happened.”

Talon looked up at her sharply. “What do you mean?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her eyes were glazed over, staring at the markings as though they were speaking to her in some language only she could understand. “The pulse... it’s been here before. Maybe not here, exactly, but somewhere. It’s been waiting. Waiting for someone to disturb it.”

Sari exchanged a glance with Talon, her face pale. “Disturb it? How?”

Dystiny’s lips twitched into a faint smile, but it wasn’t one of joy. It was bitter. “We woke it up. All of us. We didn’t even know we were doing it, but now it’s awake. And it’s hungry.”

Nathan’s hand tightened on his Bible. “This is madness,” he muttered, but there was no conviction in his voice.

Talon stood, dusting off his hands. “Madness or not, it’s real. And if this thing has been here for centuries, we need to find out why. Maybe these markings can lead us to the source.”

Sari rose to her feet, casting a wary glance at the trees surrounding them. The fog seemed thicker now, as if closing in around them. “Do you think it’s... alive?” she asked quietly. “The pulse, I mean. It feels like it has intent.”

Talon didn’t know how to answer that. It certainly felt alive, like it was watching them, waiting for the right moment to strike. But could something like this really have intent? Or was it just a force of nature, as indifferent to them as a storm or an earthquake?

“We keep moving,” he said, his voice hardening. “The sooner we figure out what’s going on, the sooner we can stop it.”

Nathan, Sari, and Dystiny fell in behind him as they continued deeper into the woods. The fog swirled around their feet, and the pulse grew louder with each step, a constant pressure against their minds. It was getting harder to think, harder to focus on anything but the thrum of energy that seemed to fill the air.

Dystiny stumbled suddenly, her hand flying to her head. “It’s too much,” she gasped. “It’s... it’s in my head.”

Talon grabbed her arm, steadying her. “Stay with me,” he said, though the pulse was starting to worm its way into his own thoughts, whispering things he couldn’t quite make out. “We’re almost there.”

“Almost where?” Nathan asked, his voice strained. “How do we even know where we’re going?”

Talon didn’t have an answer for that either. He was following instinct now, something deep in his gut telling him they were on the right path. Or maybe it wasn’t instinct. Maybe it was the pulse.

As they trudged on, the ground began to change beneath their feet. The earth was softer here, more pliable, and the trees loomed taller, their trunks twisted into unnatural shapes. The air felt heavier, thick with moisture, and the pulse was almost deafening now, a steady beat that drowned out everything else.

And then they saw it.

A clearing in the trees, bathed in a strange, flickering light. At the center of the clearing stood an ancient stone altar, weathered by time but still intact. The markings on the ground led straight to it, glowing faintly in the dim light.

“This is it,” Dystiny whispered, her voice trembling. “This is where it started.”

Nathan crossed himself instinctively, his face pale. “What is this place?”

Talon approached the altar cautiously, his heart pounding in his chest. The pulse was stronger here, almost unbearable, but he forced himself to keep moving. As he neared the altar, he could see strange symbols etched into the stone, similar to the ones they had found in the forest. But these were clearer, more deliberate, like they were meant to be seen.

“This isn’t just an altar,” Talon murmured. “It’s a trigger. This is what woke the pulse.”

Dystiny shuddered, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to leave. Now.”

But Talon couldn’t move. His hand hovered above the stone, drawn to it like a magnet. He could feel the pulse thrumming through the air, calling to him, pulling him closer.

“We have to stop it,” Sari said, her voice trembling. “We have to destroy it.”

Talon’s fingers brushed the surface of the stone, and the pulse surged through him, filling him with a blinding light.

---

**Chapter 4: Disappearance**

The sky hung heavy over Brookridge, a slate gray mass that seemed to trap the town beneath its weight. It was quiet again, the stillness broken only by the faint, ever-present hum of the pulse. Talon, Sari, and Dystiny returned from the woods in silence, the weight of their discovery pressing down on their shoulders like a secret too dark to share.

Talon had barely slept. Every time he closed his eyes, flashes of light, twisted shapes, and echoes of that unnatural energy from the object haunted him. He’d wake in a cold sweat, the pulse thrumming beneath his skin, reminding him that it was still out there, waiting.

The others weren’t faring much better. Sari sat in her shop, staring blankly at the postcards she had once cherished. The images of serene beaches and quiet countryside villages now seemed alien, as if they belonged to a world far removed from their own. Her hands trembled as she tried to arrange them, but she couldn’t focus. Her mind kept drifting back to the clearing, to the moment when Talon had touched the object.

Dystiny, for her part, was quiet. Too quiet. She sat at the diner, nursing a cup of coffee she didn’t drink, her markers forgotten in her bag. Every so often, her fingers would twitch as if reaching for them, but she never pulled them out. The pulse echoed in her head, louder now, a drumbeat that wouldn’t let up.

“What do we do now?” Sari had asked them when they parted ways after returning to town. But no one had an answer. Not yet.

***

The day passed in a haze, time slipping by in a way that felt wrong. Hours bled into one another, and by the time the sun began to set, Talon realized he had barely moved from his spot by the window. He stared out at the empty street, waiting. For what, he didn’t know.

When the knock came at his door, it startled him out of his trance. He stood, his muscles stiff, and opened it to find Sari standing there, pale and wide-eyed.

“Talon,” she said, her voice thin, almost fragile. “Something’s wrong.”

He didn’t need to ask what. He could see it in her face.

“It’s Dystiny,” Sari continued, wringing her hands. “She’s gone.”

Talon’s stomach dropped. “Gone? What do you mean, gone?”

“She... she went back to the woods,” Sari whispered. “I went to check on her at the diner, but no one’s seen her since this afternoon. I found her jacket in the clearing.”

Talon’s mind raced. “Why would she go back? We agreed we wouldn’t...”

Sari shook her head, tears brimming in her eyes. “I don’t know. But something’s wrong. I can feel it.”

The pulse throbbed louder, as if mocking them. Talon grabbed his coat and nodded to Sari. “Let’s go.”

***

The woods were darker now, the shadows longer, the trees seeming to close in on them as they made their way to the clearing. The pulse had grown stronger here, its rhythm almost erratic, as if the object was waking up. The wind rustled the leaves, but there was no sound beyond that—no birds, no animals, just the pulse and the creaking of branches.

“Do you see anything?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Talon shook his head. His eyes scanned the treeline, searching for any sign of Dystiny. But there was nothing. No movement. No sound. Only the pulse, louder now, vibrating through the ground beneath their feet.

Then, they saw it.

In the center of the clearing, where the object had been half-buried in the earth, there was a disturbance. The ground looked... wrong. Warped, as if something had pushed its way out from underneath. The pulse was deafening here, a constant thrum that made Talon’s head ache.

Sari stepped forward cautiously, her breath coming in shallow gasps. “Talon... what happened?”

He didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the spot where the object had been. It was gone.

The earth had swallowed it—or it had moved. Either way, it wasn’t there anymore. And Dystiny was nowhere to be found.

“Dystiny!” Sari called out, her voice trembling.

No answer. Just the pulse, pounding in Talon’s skull.

“We need to go,” he said, grabbing Sari’s arm. “Now.”

“But what about Dystiny?” Sari’s voice was laced with desperation.

Talon clenched his jaw. “She’s not here. And whatever took her... we’re not equipped to handle it.”

They turned to leave, but before they could take more than a few steps, the air around them shifted. Talon froze, his body tensing as a strange sensation washed over him—a distortion, like the fabric of reality itself had been twisted. Time seemed to stutter, the trees flickering in and out of focus, their edges blurring.

“Talon, what’s happening?” Sari’s voice was barely audible over the pulse, which had become a cacophony of sound, crashing through their minds like a tidal wave.

Talon’s vision swam, and for a moment, he wasn’t sure if he was standing in the woods or somewhere else entirely. The trees flickered again, replaced by ghostly afterimages—shadows of places he didn’t recognize. And then, just as quickly as it had started, the distortion stopped.

The woods returned to normal, the pulse fading back to its familiar rhythm. Talon blinked, trying to steady himself. Sari was beside him, her face pale and drawn, her breath coming in quick gasps.

“Did you... did you see that?” she asked, her voice shaky.

Talon nodded, swallowing hard. “Yeah. I saw it.”

The pulse had done something to the fabric of reality. He didn’t know how or why, but he could feel it. Time had bent, flickered, leaving them disoriented and unsure of what was real.

And Dystiny was still gone.

***

The walk back to town was a blur. Talon’s mind raced, his thoughts tangled with questions he couldn’t answer. Dystiny had vanished—taken by the pulse, or by whatever force was behind it. The object had moved, or disappeared entirely, leaving only chaos in its wake.

When they reached the town square, the air was thick with tension. People were gathered in small clusters, their faces pale, eyes wide with fear. They had felt it too—the distortion, the pulse growing stronger. Whispers of missing time, ghostly images, and lost hours rippled through the crowd like wildfire.

Talon and Sari pushed their way through the throng, heading straight for Father Nathan, who stood at the steps of the church, his brow furrowed in concern.

“You felt it, didn’t you?” Talon asked as they approached.

Father Nathan nodded, his face grim. “I did. The pulse... it’s growing more powerful. People are reporting strange things—lost time, visions of places that don’t exist.”

Sari’s voice wavered. “Dystiny’s gone. We went to the clearing, and she wasn’t there. The object... it’s moved, or disappeared. Something’s happening out there, and it’s getting worse.”

Father Nathan looked down, his hands gripping his rosary tightly. “The Lord is testing us. But we must stay strong. Dystiny... we will find her. We must keep our faith.”

Talon clenched his fists, frustration bubbling inside him. Faith wasn’t enough. Not now. Not when the pulse was tearing reality apart. But he bit back his words, knowing they wouldn’t help. Father Nathan was doing what he could, but they needed more than prayers.

They needed answers.

As the night deepened, the pulse continued, its grip tightening on the town. Talon knew that whatever had taken Dystiny wasn’t finished. This was only the beginning.

And soon, the pulse would demand more.

---

**Chapter 5: Panic in Town**

By the time they returned to Brookridge, the town had descended into chaos. The pulse wasn’t just a hum in the background anymore. It was everywhere, rattling windows, making the ground tremble with each beat. It was like the very air had taken on a life of its own, pressing down on the townspeople, warping their senses.

The square was packed with people, most of them yelling or arguing, their voices blending into an overwhelming cacophony. It was impossible to tell where one argument ended and another began. The pulse had amplified everything—their fears, their doubts, their anger—and now, it was boiling over.

Talon stopped at the edge of the square, his eyes scanning the crowd. The pulse buzzed in his skull, louder here than it had been in the woods. It was hard to focus, hard to think. He could feel it gnawing at him, fraying the edges of his thoughts, trying to pull him into the madness.

Sari stood beside him, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to get them inside,” she said, her voice barely audible over the noise. “It’s not safe out here.”

He nodded but didn’t move. Part of him wondered if there was anywhere safe left in Brookridge. The pulse had its claws in everyone now. He could see it in the way people moved, the way they spoke—jerky, erratic, their eyes darting around as if searching for something they couldn’t find.

At the center of the square, **Pastor Nathan** stood on the steps of St. Joseph’s Church, his arms raised in an attempt to calm the crowd. His voice rang out over the din, loud and firm, but there was a tremor in his words, a hint of doubt that hadn’t been there before.

“Everyone, please!” Nathan shouted, his voice cracking slightly. “We must stay calm! This is a test of faith!”

But the crowd wasn’t listening. The pulse had made sure of that. Their fear and confusion were too strong, too overwhelming. It fed on their emotions, twisting them, warping them until reason no longer had a place here.

Talon pushed through the mass of bodies, his heart pounding as the pulse throbbed louder in his ears. He could feel it trying to push him over the edge, trying to make him lose control. But he fought against it, forcing himself to focus.

“Nathan!” he shouted, finally reaching the pastor. “This isn’t helping. We need to get these people inside!”

Nathan turned toward him, his face pale, sweat beading on his forehead. For a moment, he looked lost, as though he didn’t recognize Talon at all. Then his eyes cleared, and he shook his head. “We can’t just hide, Talon. We need to stand firm. The Lord is testing us.”

Talon clenched his fists, frustration bubbling up inside him. “This isn’t a test, Nathan. This is something else—something we don’t understand. The pulse isn’t divine. It’s a force, and it’s tearing this town apart.”

Nathan’s eyes hardened, his grip tightening on the worn leather of his Bible. “You’ve lost your way, Talon. You need to have faith.”

Talon opened his mouth to argue, but before he could say anything, a woman’s scream pierced the air. The crowd parted, revealing a young mother clutching her child, her face twisted in terror. The little boy in her arms was limp, his eyes wide and unblinking.

“He’s not breathing!” she sobbed, shaking the boy frantically. “Someone, please help!”

Nathan rushed forward, pushing through the crowd to reach her. He placed a hand on the boy’s forehead, whispering a quiet prayer. But the pulse pulsed harder, deeper, making the ground quake beneath their feet. The boy’s eyes fluttered, his chest heaving, but the strange rhythm continued.

The pulse was inside him too.

“We need to get him inside!” Nathan barked, his voice full of desperation now. “We can’t lose him!”

Talon and Sari helped carry the boy toward the church, but the crowd wasn’t moving anymore. People stood frozen in place, their eyes wide with fear, their breaths shallow. Some murmured to themselves, others trembled. The pulse had wrapped its tendrils around each one of them, pulling them deeper into their own madness.

As they reached the steps of the church, Talon looked back over the square. He could see the fear growing in everyone’s eyes, see how the pulse was feeding on it, growing stronger with each heartbeat. The longer they waited, the worse it would get.

Inside the church, the air was cooler, quieter. The stone walls seemed to muffle the pulse’s presence, though it was still there, lurking just beneath the surface. Nathan laid the boy down on a pew, his hands trembling as he continued to pray over him.

Talon paced back and forth, his mind racing. “We can’t stay here. The pulse is getting stronger, and it’s feeding on them—on all of us.”

Sari sat down beside the boy, her face pale. “What are we supposed to do, Talon? We don’t even know what this thing is, or how to stop it.”

Dystiny appeared in the doorway, her eyes wild, her breath coming in short, rapid gasps. “We don’t stop it,” she said, her voice trembling. “We can’t stop it.”

Nathan looked up sharply. “What do you mean? There’s always a way. The Lord will provide.”

But Dystiny shook her head, her hands shaking as she clutched the doorframe for support. “It’s too strong. It’s inside us now. It’s... it’s changing us. Can’t you feel it?”

Nathan frowned, but his eyes flickered with uncertainty. “No. We’re stronger than this. We have to be.”

“We’re not,” Dystiny snapped, her voice rising. “This isn’t just fear or doubt. The pulse is in our heads. It’s twisting our thoughts, feeding on our emotions. It wants us to tear each other apart.”

Talon stopped pacing, his heart sinking as her words hit home. He had felt it too—the way the pulse had wormed its way into his mind, whispering things he couldn’t quite make out. It was subtle, but it was there, always there, nudging him toward something darker.

“We need to leave,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We can’t stay in town. Not while this thing is getting stronger.”

Nathan stood, his jaw set in determination. “We can’t just abandon the people, Talon. They need us.”

“They need us alive,” Sari interjected, her voice quiet but resolute. “We won’t be any help to them if we’re dead or worse.”

The church fell into a tense silence as Nathan weighed his options. The pulse continued to beat, steady and unrelenting, a constant reminder of the threat closing in on them. Finally, Nathan exhaled, his shoulders sagging in defeat.

“Fine,” he muttered, “but we can’t leave everyone here. We’ll take as many as we can.”

Talon nodded, though he knew it wouldn’t be enough. They couldn’t save everyone. The pulse was too strong, too far-reaching. But they had to try.

As they prepared to leave, the church doors slammed open, and a group of people from the square burst inside, their faces twisted in fear and desperation. They swarmed toward Nathan, their hands reaching out as they begged for answers, for salvation.

“Please, Pastor!” a man cried, his voice shaking. “You have to help us! You have to stop this!”

Nathan hesitated, glancing back at Talon. His eyes were filled with uncertainty, but he couldn’t turn them away. Not now.

“We’ll do what we can,” Nathan said, though the words sounded hollow, even to him.

The pulse throbbed again, louder this time, shaking the very foundation of the church. Dust fell from the rafters, and the crowd recoiled in terror.

Talon gritted his teeth, his hand tightening on the knife at his belt. “We need to move. Now.”

As they began herding the townspeople toward the back of the church, the pulse surged again, more powerful than ever before. It wasn’t just a sound anymore—it was a force, an overwhelming pressure that seemed to wrap around them, squeezing tighter with every second.

Talon could feel it closing in, pulling them toward something darker, something they couldn’t see but knew was there, waiting.

And the worst part was, it wasn’t just out there.

It was inside them too.

**Chapter 6: The Pulse Reveals Secrets**

The church was eerily silent, save for the low hum of the pulse that had woven itself into the very foundation of the building. Talon sat slumped against the cold stone wall, trying to catch his breath. Sari was beside him, her face pale, her hands trembling as she stared at the heavy wooden doors that now separated them from the chaos outside.

Father Nathan stood at the altar, his back to them, gripping the edge of the pulpit as though he might fall if he let go. His lips moved silently in prayer, but Talon could sense the doubt creeping into the man’s heart. The pulse had shaken everyone, even those whose faith seemed unshakable.

“What do we do now?” Sari asked, her voice barely more than a whisper.

Talon shook his head, staring at the floor. “I don’t know. This thing... it’s not just a sound. It’s affecting us. Warping us.”

“It’s not just warping,” Sari muttered, running a hand through her tangled hair. “It’s... pulling things out of us. I felt it earlier—memories, thoughts, stuff I hadn’t thought about in years. It’s like it’s digging inside of us.”

Talon’s gaze shifted to her. He hadn’t told anyone, but he had felt it too. Ever since he’d touched that object in the woods, his dreams had been plagued by fragments of memories—things he had buried long ago. Things he didn’t want to remember.

Sari continued, her voice trembling, “I keep seeing my parents. They were strict—too strict. I grew up under the weight of their expectations, and now... it’s like I’m back there again, trapped in that house, never good enough. Every time the pulse hits, I feel it, as if it’s pulling me back into those moments.”

Talon reached out, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You’re not alone. It’s doing the same to me. I’ve been seeing... my brother.” He paused, swallowing hard. “He died when we were kids. I’ve tried to forget, but now it’s like the pulse is forcing me to relive it, over and over.”

Sari’s eyes softened with empathy, but there was no time for comfort. A sudden creaking sound echoed through the church, and they both turned to see Father Nathan stumbling away from the altar, his face pale and drawn.

“It’s not just us,” Father Nathan murmured, his voice shaky. “It’s... it’s everyone. The pulse—it’s pulling out our sins, our fears, our guilt. This is a test of faith, yes, but it’s also... a reckoning.”

Talon frowned. “A reckoning?”

Father Nathan nodded, his hands trembling as he held his rosary close to his chest. “I’ve been seeing things, too. Visions of the past. My failures, my weaknesses... they’re all coming back to haunt me. I thought I had left them behind, but the pulse... it’s unearthing them. I think it’s showing us who we truly are.”

“That doesn’t explain why,” Talon said, standing. “Why now? Why is it happening here?”

Before anyone could answer, the door to the church burst open with a loud crash. Talon spun around, his heart racing, half expecting the shadows to pour in. But instead, a figure staggered through the doorway, collapsing onto the cold stone floor.

It was Dystiny.

Sari gasped and rushed to her side, kneeling beside her. Dystiny was pale, her clothes torn and dirty, her eyes wide and unfocused. She was breathing heavily, her body shaking as though she had been running for days.

“Dystiny! Are you okay?” Sari asked, gently shaking her.

Dystiny’s eyes fluttered, and for a moment, it seemed as if she didn’t recognize them. Then, slowly, her gaze focused on Sari, and her lips parted, though no sound came out at first. She looked haunted, like she had seen things no one should ever see.

“Dystiny, where have you been?” Talon asked, crouching beside her. “We thought you were gone.”

“I... I was,” Dystiny rasped, her voice barely audible. “I... don’t know where I went.”

Talon’s stomach churned. “What do you mean?”

Dystiny’s eyes darted to the ceiling, her hands gripping the floor as though she needed to hold on to something solid. “I went back to the clearing... to the object. It was calling me. I couldn’t resist. When I touched it... everything changed.”

Sari’s hand froze. “What do you mean ‘everything changed’?”

Dystiny blinked, and a single tear slid down her cheek. “I wasn’t here anymore. I don’t know where I was, but... it wasn’t here. It was like... another version of this place. But twisted. Dark. The sky was black, the air was thick, and the pulse... it was everywhere.”

Talon exchanged a glance with Sari. “Another version of Brookridge?”

Dystiny nodded weakly. “And I wasn’t alone. I saw... people. People from town. But they were different. Hollow, like they weren’t real. Like they were just... echoes.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his eyes wide with concern. “What you’re describing... it sounds like a vision. But visions aren’t supposed to be this real.”

“It wasn’t just a vision,” Dystiny whispered, her voice breaking. “It was real. I was there for days. I... I lost track of time. And then, just as suddenly as I arrived, I was back. But I’m not the same. I feel... older.”

Talon’s eyes narrowed. “Older?”

Dystiny nodded. “I don’t know how long I was there, but it felt like... years. Decades, maybe. And I saw things. Horrible things. Brookridge was gone, swallowed by the pulse. And the people... they were consumed by it.”

Sari covered her mouth, her eyes wide with horror. “That can’t be...”

“It’s true,” Dystiny insisted, her voice growing stronger. “I don’t know what the pulse is, but it’s not just a sound or an energy. It’s alive. It’s... feeding on us. On our memories, our fears, our sins. It wants more.”

Father Nathan looked pale, his rosary clutched tightly in his hands. “This is... a test of faith. It must be.”

“No,” Dystiny whispered, shaking her head. “It’s not a test. It’s a warning. And if we don’t stop it, the pulse will consume everything. It already has... in that other place.”

Talon stood, his mind racing. “We need to figure out how to stop it. If the pulse is alive, if it’s feeding on us, we have to find a way to cut it off.”

“But how?” Sari asked, her voice trembling. “We don’t even know where it’s coming from.”

Dystiny closed her eyes, her breathing slow and labored. “It’s... in the earth. Deep underground. That’s where it’s strongest.”

Talon’s gaze hardened. “Then that’s where we’ll go.”

Father Nathan shook his head, his voice soft but firm. “No. We cannot face this alone. We need the strength of the Lord.”

Talon clenched his fists. “We need more than faith to stop this.”

The pulse throbbed in the air, louder now, like a living thing breathing just beneath the surface.

The time for decisions was over.

They had to act.

**Chapter 7: Reality Fractures**

By the time the sun set again, Brookridge felt like a place suspended between two worlds. The pulse had warped reality, twisting the very air, bending time and space until nothing felt solid anymore. The streets stretched out in ways that shouldn’t have been possible, the buildings casting long, distorted shadows across the ground. 

Talon felt it the moment he stepped outside. The town didn’t look right—angles were sharper, colors too vivid, as if someone had turned the saturation up on the entire world. The pulse wasn’t just a vibration beneath the earth anymore. It was in everything: the trees, the houses, the sky. It was inside them too, whispering at the edges of their minds, pushing them toward the brink.

He tightened his grip on the flashlight, casting its beam into the unnatural darkness. The streets were empty, but not silent. Every so often, he’d catch a glimpse of something moving just out of sight—a shadow that darted too quickly to be real, a whisper of sound that disappeared as soon as he focused on it.

Behind him, Sari and Dystiny followed closely, their faces pale and drawn. None of them had slept in over 24 hours. The pulse had seen to that. It didn’t allow for rest anymore. Whenever they closed their eyes, it was there, waiting, pulling them into strange, fragmented dreams that felt more like memories than figments of imagination. 

Dystiny rubbed her temples, her steps slowing. “It’s warping everything,” she muttered, her voice barely audible over the constant hum. “I can’t... I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”

Sari glanced at her, worry etched into her features. “We’re still here, Dyst. Stay with us.”

“I’m trying,” Dystiny whispered, but her voice sounded distant, as if she were already slipping away.

Talon stopped at the corner of the street, his eyes scanning the darkness. He could feel the pulse more strongly now, pressing against his mind, making it harder to think, harder to focus. “We need to get to the church,” he said, though even that plan felt tenuous now. The church had once been a refuge, but how long would that last with the pulse growing stronger by the hour?

They made their way through the distorted streets, the pulse echoing in their heads like a heartbeat that wasn’t their own. Talon could feel it, crawling through his thoughts, twisting them, making him question everything he saw. The shadows seemed to lengthen with every step, the buildings looming over them like giants, watching, waiting.

Finally, they reached St. Joseph’s, the doors still open, beckoning them inside. Pastor Nathan stood in the entryway, his face pale and gaunt, the weight of his doubt written in every line of his body. He didn’t say anything as they approached, just stepped aside to let them pass.

Inside, the church was dimly lit, candles flickering on the altar. The pulse was quieter here, but not gone. It lurked in the corners, a steady thrum just beneath the surface, waiting for its moment to strike.

Talon collapsed onto one of the pews, rubbing his temples. His head felt like it was being squeezed in a vice, the pressure unbearable. “This is getting worse,” he muttered. “I don’t know how much more of this we can take.”

Nathan sat down beside him, his Bible clutched tightly in his hands. “It’s testing us,” he said, though there was little conviction in his voice. “We have to stay strong.”

Talon glanced at him, exhaustion clouding his vision. “It’s not a test, Nathan. It’s not divine. It’s... something else.”

Nathan didn’t respond. He just stared straight ahead, his fingers tracing the worn leather of his Bible, his lips moving in a silent prayer. 

Sari sat across from them, her eyes fixed on the door. “Do you think it’s... changing us?” she asked quietly. “I mean, really changing us. Not just in our heads.”

Talon frowned, but before he could answer, Dystiny spoke up from the back of the church, her voice a trembling whisper. “It is.”

They turned to see her standing near the altar, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She was shaking, her eyes wide with fear. “I’ve been seeing things. Things that shouldn’t be there. Memories that aren’t mine.”

Nathan stood abruptly, his face pale. “What do you mean?”

Dystiny shook her head, her breath coming in short, rapid gasps. “It’s not just warping the town. It’s warping us. Our minds, our memories. I’m seeing... I’m seeing things from years ago. Things I’ve never experienced. But they feel real.”

Talon exchanged a glance with Sari, his stomach twisting in unease. The pulse was doing more than just distorting reality—it was digging into their minds, pulling out pieces that didn’t belong, blurring the line between what was real and what wasn’t.

“We need to figure out how to stop it,” Talon said, though the words felt hollow. How could they stop something like this? Something that was everywhere and nowhere at once, something that had seeped into their very being?

Before anyone could respond, the pulse surged again, stronger than before. The candles flickered wildly, the air thickening with a pressure so intense it felt like the walls themselves were closing in. Talon gasped, clutching his head as the pulse bore down on him, pressing into his skull with relentless force.

Dystiny collapsed to her knees, her hands gripping the edge of the altar. “It’s too strong!” she cried, her voice strained. “It’s... it’s inside me!”

Nathan rushed to her side, but Talon knew there was nothing they could do. The pulse was feeding on them, twisting their thoughts, pulling them further into its grasp. It wasn’t just a force anymore—it was a presence, alive and malevolent, and it wasn’t going to stop until it had consumed them completely.

The room spun as the pulse grew louder, drowning out everything else. Talon’s vision blurred, his thoughts fracturing under the weight of it all. He could feel it pressing deeper into his mind, twisting his memories, making him question everything he knew. Was this real? Was any of it real?

He staggered to his feet, barely able to stay upright as the pulse surged again, shaking the very foundation of the church. The walls seemed to warp, bending inward as the pulse tried to crush them, to break them.

Nathan stood, his voice rising above the chaos. “We can’t give in!” he shouted, though his voice trembled with fear. “We have to hold on!”

But Talon could barely hear him anymore. The pulse had taken over everything, drowning out all sound, all thought. It was in his head, pulling him down into a darkness that had no end.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the pulse stopped.

The pressure lifted, the air clearing as if nothing had happened. Talon collapsed onto the floor, gasping for breath, his heart pounding in his chest. His mind was still reeling, the edges of his thoughts frayed and tattered, but for the first time in what felt like days, the world seemed still.

Nathan helped him to his feet, his face pale but determined. “We need to find the source,” he said quietly. “Before it starts again.”

Talon nodded, though he wasn’t sure how much more they could take. The pulse had pushed them to their limits, fractured their reality, and now, it was only a matter of time before it returned, stronger than ever.

---

**Chapter 8: The Underground Discovery**

The descent into the earth was slow and treacherous. The narrow path twisted and turned, the walls pressing in on all sides, as if the earth itself was trying to swallow them whole. The deeper they went, the colder the air became, until it felt like they were walking into the belly of a beast. The pulse was louder here, no longer a faint vibration beneath their feet but a living, breathing thing, thrumming through the stone, echoing off the walls.

Talon led the way, his flashlight cutting through the darkness. Behind him, Sari followed closely, clutching a rope tied to her waist, her face pale but determined. Jack and Dystiny brought up the rear, their eyes darting around as if they expected the walls to close in on them at any moment.

“We’re close,” Jack whispered, his voice barely audible over the steady beat of the pulse. “I can feel it.”

Talon glanced back at him, his jaw tight. He could feel it too—something was drawing them deeper, pulling them toward the heart of the pulse. The air around them was thick with tension, every step heavier than the last. It felt as if time itself was bending, warping around them, making it impossible to know how long they had been walking.

Sari stumbled slightly, catching herself against the wall. “This place... it feels wrong.”

Talon nodded, his eyes scanning the darkness ahead. “We’re not supposed to be here.”

Jack slowed his pace, his hand brushing the stone wall beside him. “It’s ancient. I don’t think anyone has been down here for centuries.”

Dystiny shivered, pulling her coat tighter around her. “Maybe there’s a reason no one’s been down here.”

Talon didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. They all knew that whatever they were walking into, it was far older and far more dangerous than they could imagine.

After what felt like an eternity, the tunnel finally opened up into a vast underground chamber. Talon’s breath caught in his throat as his flashlight illuminated the space. It was massive, the ceiling soaring high above them, the walls carved with strange symbols that seemed to shimmer in the light.

At the center of the chamber stood a large stone structure, half-buried in the ground. It pulsed with energy, the same rhythmic beat that had haunted them for days, only now it was stronger—so strong that Talon could feel it vibrating through his bones.

“This is it,” Jack whispered, stepping forward. His eyes were wide with a mix of awe and fear. “This is the source.”

Talon approached the stone structure cautiously, his flashlight casting long shadows across the floor. The closer he got, the more he could feel the pulse pressing against him, like a physical weight. He reached out, his fingers brushing the surface of the stone. It was cold, but it thrummed with life, like a heartbeat.

“It’s alive,” Sari whispered, her eyes wide as she took in the strange carvings on the walls. “This whole place... it’s part of something bigger.”

Talon stepped back, his heart pounding. “We need to figure out what this is—what it’s doing to the town.”

Dystiny approached the stone, her hands trembling. “It’s not just doing something to the town. It’s doing something to us. I can feel it... pulling at me.”

Jack moved closer to the stone, his hand tracing the symbols carved into its surface. “These symbols... they’re ancient. I don’t recognize the language, but it’s like they’re... alive.”

Talon’s stomach churned as he looked around the chamber. The walls seemed to shimmer, as if they were shifting, warping in and out of focus. The pulse was getting stronger, its rhythm pounding in his ears.

“What do we do?” Sari asked, her voice trembling.

“We destroy it,” Talon said, his voice steady despite the fear clawing at his chest. “We can’t let this thing keep feeding on us.”

Jack shook his head, his eyes wide. “You can’t destroy it. This isn’t just a piece of rock. It’s part of something much larger—something we can’t even begin to understand.”

Talon turned to him, his fists clenched. “If we don’t destroy it, it’s going to destroy us. You’ve seen what it’s doing to the town.”

Before Jack could respond, the pulse surged, sending a shockwave through the chamber. Talon staggered, nearly losing his balance as the ground trembled beneath his feet. The walls shimmered violently, and for a brief moment, the chamber flickered—reality bending and warping around them.

When the world snapped back into focus, Talon’s breath caught in his throat. The chamber hadn’t changed, but something was different—something was watching them. He could feel it, a presence lurking just beyond the edge of his perception, waiting.

“We’re not alone,” Dystiny whispered, her voice barely audible.

Talon scanned the darkness, his flashlight shaking in his hand. “What is it?”

“I don’t know,” Dystiny said, her eyes wide with fear. “But it’s... watching us.”

The pulse throbbed again, and Talon felt a cold sweat break out across his skin. The air around them seemed to ripple, and suddenly, shadows began to move along the walls, twisting and writhing like living things.

Sari gasped, stumbling back. “What is that?”

Talon’s heart raced as the shadows coalesced into vague shapes—figures that flickered in and out of existence, like ghosts caught between worlds. They weren’t human. They weren’t even alive, but they were watching, their eyes fixed on the group with a cold, hungry gaze.

“We need to get out of here,” Talon said, his voice tight. “Now.”

Jack shook his head, his eyes glued to the stone structure. “No... we’re too close. We need to understand what this is—”

Another shockwave hit, stronger this time. The ground cracked beneath their feet, and the pulse roared through the chamber, deafening. The shadows surged forward, their forms twisting and flickering, and for the briefest moment, Talon saw faces—faces twisted with agony, their mouths open in silent screams.

Sari screamed, grabbing Talon’s arm. “We have to go!”

But Talon couldn’t move. The pulse was too strong, pulling at him, dragging him toward the stone. It was like gravity, drawing him in, whispering to him, promising him answers if only he would let go.

“Talon!” Sari’s voice cut through the fog in his mind, and he blinked, shaking off the haze.

“Go!” Talon shouted, wrenching himself away from the stone. “Get out of here!”

They ran, the pulse pounding in their ears, the shadows chasing them, growing stronger with each step. The walls of the chamber warped and twisted, reality buckling under the weight of the pulse.

The tunnel loomed ahead, and they scrambled toward it, their breaths coming in ragged gasps. As they reached the entrance, Talon risked a glance back.

The shadows had stopped at the edge of the chamber, writhing and flickering, unable to follow. But the pulse... the pulse was growing louder, angrier, as if it had been denied something it desperately wanted.

They stumbled out of the tunnel, collapsing onto the ground, gasping for breath. The night air was cold and sharp, a stark contrast to the suffocating atmosphere underground.

Talon sat up, his heart pounding in his chest. They had found the source of the pulse—but they hadn’t destroyed it. And now it knew they were there.

“It’s only going to get worse,” Jack said, his voice hoarse. “It’s waking up.”

Talon clenched his fists, his jaw tight. “Then we need to figure out how to stop it—for good.”

Dystiny, still trembling from the ordeal, nodded. “Before it destroys us all.”

The pulse throbbed beneath them, a reminder that time was running out. Brookridge was on the edge of oblivion, and if they didn’t stop the pulse soon, it would consume everything.

---

**Chapter 9: Temporal Loops**

Talon wasn’t sure when the loops started. Time had always felt fragile since the pulse first arrived, but now, it had shattered completely. One moment, he was standing in the woods, his breath visible in the cold air, and the next, he was back in town, staring at a sky that flickered between day and night. It was as if Brookridge had become unmoored from reality, drifting through fractured moments, never quite settling.

The others felt it too. Sari was the first to notice, her eyes narrowing as she glanced around the streets. “Something’s wrong,” she whispered. “We’ve been here before. I... I remember this.”

Talon frowned. His mind was foggy, the pulse pressing against his thoughts like a vice. He struggled to focus, to ground himself in the present. But Sari was right—there was something familiar about this moment. The way the wind moved through the trees, the smell of rain in the air, the distant sound of footsteps. It all felt... wrong.

Dystiny sat on the steps of the church, her knees pulled to her chest, staring blankly into the distance. She hadn’t spoken much since the incident in the clearing. Whatever they had disturbed, it had done something to her, fractured her mind in a way none of them fully understood.

“It’s the same,” she murmured, barely audible. “It’s all the same.”

Nathan stood nearby, pacing restlessly. His faith, once unshakable, now hung by a thread. He clutched his Bible tightly, but it offered little comfort. The pulse had burrowed its way into his soul, shaking the foundation of everything he believed in. He had tried to pray, to lead his congregation, but the words felt empty, hollow.

Talon watched him, feeling a pang of sympathy. He knew that Nathan had been struggling, but he hadn’t realized how deep the cracks had gone. The pastor wasn’t just fighting to keep the town together—he was fighting to keep himself together.

“We need to figure out what’s happening,” Talon said, though his voice sounded distant, as if he were speaking from far away. “This... this isn’t normal.”

Sari shook her head. “It’s the pulse. It’s doing something to time. It’s like... like we’re stuck, looping through the same moments over and over again.”

Talon stared at her, his mind racing. He had felt it too—the strange sensation that time wasn’t moving the way it should, that they were caught in some kind of loop. But how was that even possible? The pulse was strong, yes, but could it really warp reality this much?

“We have to break the loop,” Dystiny said suddenly, her voice sharp, cutting through the fog that had settled over them. She stood, her eyes wide, wild. “If we don’t, it’ll keep happening. Over and over again.”

Nathan looked at her, frowning. “How? How do we break something like this?”

Dystiny turned toward him, her face pale but determined. “We have to go back to where it started. To the clearing. That’s where it all went wrong.”

Talon’s stomach twisted at the thought. The clearing—the altar, the symbols—it had been the start of everything, the moment the pulse had truly awoken. Going back there felt like walking into a trap, but what choice did they have?

Sari stepped forward, her voice quiet but steady. “She’s right. We have to try.”

Talon nodded, though dread coiled in his gut. “Fine. But we need to be careful. The pulse... it’s stronger now. We don’t know what it’ll do.”

The group made their way back through the warped streets, their footsteps echoing in the unnatural stillness. Talon’s heart raced, his pulse syncing with the steady thrum beneath the earth. Every now and then, the world flickered, and they found themselves back at a moment they had already lived—Nathan pacing, Sari glancing around nervously, Dystiny murmuring to herself.

It was disorienting, maddening, as if the pulse was toying with them, pulling them through time like puppets on strings. But they kept moving, pushing through the fog of confusion, determined to reach the clearing before it was too late.

When they finally arrived, the sight of the altar sent a chill down Talon’s spine. It stood exactly as they had left it, the strange symbols carved into the stone, glowing faintly in the dim light. The air around it was thick with energy, vibrating with a power that seemed to warp the very fabric of reality.

Dystiny approached the altar cautiously, her hands trembling. “This is where it happened,” she whispered. “This is where we broke time.”

Nathan stepped forward, his face pale. “What do we do now? How do we fix it?”

Sari glanced around, her brow furrowed. “There has to be something... some way to reverse it.”

Talon moved closer to the altar, his breath coming in shallow gasps. The pulse was stronger here, almost deafening. He could feel it pressing against his mind, warping his thoughts, making it harder to think. But as he stared at the symbols, something clicked.

“These markings,” he muttered, tracing them with his finger. “They’re not just symbols. They’re... instructions.”

Sari frowned, stepping closer. “Instructions for what?”

Talon swallowed hard, the weight of the realization settling over him. “For controlling the pulse. For stopping it.”

Nathan stared at him, disbelief written on his face. “How could something like this be controlled? It’s a force of nature.”

“Maybe it was once,” Talon replied, his voice shaking. “But someone—something—used this altar to harness it. To bind it. And when we disturbed it, we broke that binding.”

Dystiny let out a shaky breath, her eyes wide. “So, we can put it back?”

Talon nodded slowly, though he wasn’t entirely sure. “I think so. But it won’t be easy. The pulse is... it’s alive. It’s fighting us. It doesn’t want to be bound again.”

Sari stepped up beside him, her voice firm. “Then we fight back.”

Nathan hesitated, doubt flickering in his eyes. “This... this goes against everything I believe. This isn’t God’s will.”

Talon turned to him, his expression hard. “This isn’t about God, Nathan. This is about saving our town. Saving ourselves.”

For a moment, the pastor said nothing, his gaze fixed on the altar. Then, with a sigh, he nodded. “Alright. Let’s do it.”

They moved quickly, following the instructions carved into the stone. It was delicate work—one wrong step, and the pulse would lash out, tearing through them like a hurricane. But they worked together, focused, determined.

As they worked, the pulse grew louder, more violent. The ground shook beneath their feet, and the air crackled with energy. Talon could feel it fighting them, pushing back against their efforts, trying to break free. But they didn’t stop. They couldn’t.

Finally, after what felt like hours, they finished. The last symbol was carved, the last piece of the puzzle locked into place. Talon stepped back, his heart pounding in his chest. The pulse surged one last time, so loud it was deafening, so powerful it brought them all to their knees.

Then, as quickly as it had begun, it stopped.

The silence was deafening. The air was still, the ground solid beneath their feet. The pulse was gone.

For a long moment, no one spoke. They just stood there, breathing heavily, their minds struggling to process what had just happened.

Nathan was the first to break the silence, his voice quiet and full of awe. “Is it over?”

Talon nodded, though a part of him wasn’t sure. “I think so.”

Sari let out a long breath, relief washing over her face. “We did it.”

But as they made their way back to town, Talon couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t over. The pulse might be gone, but the damage it had done—to them, to Brookridge, to time itself—was irreversible.

And somewhere deep in the earth, something was still watching, waiting.

**Chapter 10: The Pulse’s Growth**

The pulse had spread beyond Brookridge. By morning, strange phenomena were being reported in the surrounding towns—animals behaving erratically, objects moving on their own, and people experiencing vivid hallucinations. Talon knew time was running out. Whatever force they had awakened beneath the earth was growing stronger, its influence seeping out of the town like a dark cloud, corrupting everything in its path.

They stood at the edge of the woods, the early morning mist hanging low over the ground. Sari clutched Amelia’s crumpled map in her hands, her eyes scanning the simple lines and symbols drawn with a child’s hand. The map seemed to lead deeper into the underground chamber, to a place they hadn’t yet explored. A place where answers might be waiting.

“We have to go back,” Talon said, his voice resolute. He stared at the entrance to the underground tunnel, the weight of the decision heavy in his chest. Every instinct told him to run, to get as far away from the pulse as possible. But running wasn’t an option. The pulse was spreading, and if they didn’t stop it now, it would consume everything.

Sari nodded, her face pale but determined. “We know what we’re dealing with now. We have to stop it.”

Jack stood a few steps away, his hands trembling as he clutched his flashlight. His face was gaunt, his eyes sunken with exhaustion. The pulse had taken its toll on him, warping his brilliant mind into a tangled mess of fear and confusion. But even in his broken state, there was still a flicker of determination in his eyes.

“I’ve been thinking,” Jack said quietly, his voice shaky. “The pulse isn’t just alive—it’s sentient. It’s learning, growing. Every time we interact with it, it changes. And now it’s growing beyond the town. We need to figure out what it wants, or we won’t be able to stop it.”

Dystiny, who had been silent for most of the morning, finally spoke up. “What if we’re too late? What if it’s already spread too far?”

Talon clenched his fists. “We can’t think like that. We’ve seen what the pulse can do—it warps reality, traps people in loops, feeds on fear and memories. But it hasn’t won yet. There’s still time.”

Father Nathan had insisted on joining them, despite his earlier reservations. He stood beside Sari, his face drawn and weary, but his eyes were filled with a grim determination. “Faith is what will guide us through this,” he said softly. “Even in the face of this darkness, we must hold onto hope.”

Talon didn’t know if faith would be enough, but he appreciated the priest’s resolve. They needed every ounce of strength they could muster. The pulse was growing stronger by the hour, and they were running out of options.

“Let’s go,” Talon said, leading the way into the tunnel.

The descent into the underground chamber felt different this time. The pulse was louder, its rhythm more erratic, like the beating of a heart pushed to the brink of collapse. The walls seemed to shimmer with energy, the strange symbols carved into the stone glowing faintly in the dim light of their flashlights.

Sari walked beside Talon, holding the map tightly in her hand. “The map leads deeper,” she said quietly. “There’s a section we missed, a part of the chamber we didn’t explore.”

“Do you think that’s where the core of the pulse is?” Talon asked, his voice low.

“I don’t know,” Sari admitted. “But it feels right. Like we’re being guided there.”

The group moved cautiously through the chamber, their footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. The pulse thrummed beneath them, vibrating through the stone, making the air around them feel thick and heavy. Talon could feel the weight of it pressing down on him, like a storm about to break.

As they ventured deeper into the chamber, the walls seemed to pulse with light, the symbols glowing brighter with each step they took. Talon’s heart pounded in his chest, the pulse matching the rhythm of his own heartbeat. He could feel it now—an insistent tug, pulling him toward something. Toward the source.

“There,” Jack whispered, pointing ahead.

In the center of the chamber, half-buried in the ground, was a massive stone structure. It was different from the one they had seen before. Larger, more intricate. The symbols carved into its surface seemed to writhe and twist, alive with energy.

The pulse was stronger here, almost deafening. Talon could feel it vibrating through his bones, making his skin prickle with static.

“We’ve found it,” Sari breathed, her eyes wide with awe and fear.

“This is the core,” Jack said, his voice trembling. “This is where the pulse is coming from.”

Talon stepped forward cautiously, his eyes locked on the stone structure. It thrummed with power, the pulse radiating from it like a living thing. He could feel it pulling at him, whispering in the back of his mind, promising him answers—if only he would give in.

“What do we do?” Dystiny asked, her voice barely audible.

“We stop it,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We destroy it.”

“How?” Sari asked, her eyes wide. “We don’t even know what it is.”

Before Talon could answer, the pulse surged, and the ground beneath their feet trembled violently. The walls of the chamber warped and twisted, and the air around them seemed to crackle with electricity. Talon staggered, catching himself against the stone wall.

“What’s happening?” Dystiny cried, panic rising in her voice.

“The pulse,” Jack gasped. “It’s fighting back.”

The ground shook again, harder this time, and cracks began to form in the stone beneath their feet. Talon’s heart raced as the pulse throbbed louder, its rhythm erratic and wild. It was like the pulse was alive, struggling against them, trying to protect itself.

“We have to destroy it now,” Talon shouted, his voice barely audible over the deafening roar of the pulse. “If we don’t, it’s going to consume everything!”

“But how?” Sari cried, her eyes filled with fear.

Talon stared at the stone structure, his mind racing. There had to be a way. The pulse was alive, sentient, but it was vulnerable. It fed on fear, on memories, on their darkest thoughts. But it was also bound to this place—this core.

Then it hit him.

“The pulse is tied to us,” Talon said, his voice steady despite the chaos around them. “It’s feeding on us—on our memories, our fears, our guilt. That’s how it’s growing stronger.”

“We’ve seen it,” Jack added, his voice trembling. “It warps reality, traps people in loops, makes them relive their worst moments. It’s using our minds against us.”

Talon took a deep breath. “Then we need to starve it. We need to take away its power.”

Father Nathan frowned, his hand tightening around his rosary. “And how do we do that?”

“We cut ourselves off,” Talon said, his voice firm. “We have to confront the things it’s feeding on—the fears, the memories, the guilt. We have to face them and let them go.”

Sari’s eyes widened. “You mean... we have to make peace with it?”

Talon nodded. “If we don’t, the pulse will keep feeding on us, and it’ll keep growing stronger. But if we can cut off its food source, we can weaken it. Maybe even destroy it.”

Father Nathan stepped forward, his face resolute. “Then let us begin.”

The pulse throbbed louder, its rhythm chaotic and wild, but Talon felt a strange calm settle over him. He knew what they had to do now. They had to face the darkness within themselves, confront the memories and fears the pulse had twisted and used against them.

One by one, they gathered around the stone structure, closing their eyes as the pulse washed over them. The air crackled with energy, and the chamber seemed to warp around them, but they stood firm, bracing themselves for what was to come.

The pulse was about to reveal their darkest truths.

And if they didn’t confront them, the pulse would consume them all.
