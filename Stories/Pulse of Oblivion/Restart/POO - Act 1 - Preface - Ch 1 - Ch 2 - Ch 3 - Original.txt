### **Preface: The Pulse**

The fog clung to the trees like an ancient memory that refused to fade. Every breath Sari took was heavy, the air thick and oppressive, as if the very forest had come alive to watch her. Somewhere, just beyond her vision, a low rumble echoed—not from the sky, but from deep within the earth. It was subtle at first, but now, every tremor beneath her feet felt like a heartbeat, syncing with her own pulse.

She stood still, listening, her heart pounding louder with each passing second. Every beat felt like a countdown to something inevitable. **The Pulse**. It was here. It had always been here. Silent, unseen, waiting.

She hadn’t always been able to sense it—not at first. For so long, it had been just a faint, distant hum, barely noticeable, lurking beneath the surface of things. But once she felt it, once she recognized it, there was no ignoring it anymore. No escaping it.

Sari gripped the necklace in her palm, its cold metal grounding her in the present, even as the memories of Talon threatened to pull her back into the past. The necklace was the last real thing she had of him. His touch lingered on it, the weight of it a reminder of everything they had shared, everything they had built together. 

**Talon.**

A flash of memory burned behind her eyes—the two of them under the stars, his arm wrapped around her, his voice low and warm as he whispered promises into the night air. **“We’ll always have this, Sari. No matter what happens.”** 

But now, it felt like those words belonged to someone else, someone who no longer existed. The Talon she had known was slipping away, consumed by the Pulse’s hunger. It wasn’t just after his body—it was after his very essence. His creativity, his soul, his being. 

The fog wrapped tighter around her legs, tugging her forward. The Pulse was waiting, somewhere deeper in the forest, hungry and relentless. She had followed Talon this far, through the twisting paths, through the shifting landscape of her own despair. 

**You can’t save him.**

The words echoed in her mind, cruel and distorted. She had heard them before—whispers carried on the wind, sometimes in Talon’s voice, sometimes in her own. The Pulse was clever. It knew how to get inside, how to twist things just enough to make you doubt yourself. 

She couldn’t afford to doubt herself now. Not when she was this close. She had to believe that Talon was still out there, somewhere, beyond the Pulse’s reach.

But time was running out.

### **Chapter 1: The Chase**

The forest seemed to pulse beneath her feet, each step a struggle against the ground that shifted and trembled as though it was alive. The fog was thick, swirling around her, threatening to smother her. Every breath was heavy, the air too dense to fill her lungs fully. Sari ran harder, her legs burning, her lungs aching, but she couldn’t stop now.

**Talon** was out there. Somewhere. She could feel him.

But with each passing moment, the Pulse tightened its grip on the forest. The ground felt unnatural, like it wasn’t solid beneath her feet anymore. As if the earth itself was shifting in response to the Pulse’s influence. A wave of dizziness washed over her, and for a moment, she stumbled, almost falling, but she caught herself just in time.

The fog closed in around her, thicker now, more suffocating. And with it came the whispers.

**“He’s gone… You failed him… You’ll never find him…”**

The voices twisted in the wind, curling into her ears, filling her head with doubt. Sari clenched her jaw, trying to drown them out, but the whispers were relentless, gnawing at the edges of her thoughts. They sounded like Talon—like the way he had once spoken to her in the quiet moments when they were alone. 

A memory surged forward, unbidden—a warm summer night, the two of them lying on the roof of the cabin they had built together. Talon had been sketching the stars, his hand moving quickly, capturing their light and beauty on the page. He had smiled at her, that crooked, easy smile she had fallen in love with, and said, **“We’ll build everything here. Just you and me.”** 

Sari’s chest tightened. That world was gone now, crumbling beneath her feet. The Pulse was tearing it apart, piece by piece.

Something rustled in the underbrush, pulling her back to the present. Sari froze, her breath catching in her throat. Her eyes darted toward the sound, but the fog was too thick to see anything clearly. For a moment, she thought she saw a shadow—a figure moving in the distance—but when she blinked, it was gone.

Her heart raced. **Was it an animal? Or something worse?**

She forced herself to move again, her steps slower, more cautious. The feeling of being watched crept over her, cold and unsettling. There were unseen eyes in the forest, lurking just beyond the fog, stalking her. The Pulse wasn’t the only thing hunting her. Something else was out there, waiting.

Her eyes caught movement on the trees. The bark was scarred, marked by deep, jagged scratches, and strange **symbols** that hadn’t been there before. The markings glowed faintly, pulsating with the same rhythm that throbbed beneath the ground. They seemed to shift and twist as she moved, as if the trees themselves were alive, watching her.

The Pulse was changing everything, warping reality. If it could do this to the forest, what had it done to Talon?

### **Chapter 2: The Cabin**

The cabin stood at the edge of the clearing, a stark contrast to the fog-drenched forest that surrounded it. It was exactly as she remembered, but there was something wrong—something off. The air inside was heavy, thick with an oppressive energy that clung to her skin. The walls seemed to pulse in time with her own heartbeat, as though the Pulse had seeped into the very bones of the place.

Sari stepped inside, her breath catching in her throat. This had been their safe haven once—a place where they could escape the world and lose themselves in their art. She could still see the remnants of their lives here. The sketches on the walls, the half-finished stories scattered across the table. Talon’s drawings—beautiful and chaotic—hung like ghosts in the air. 

But now, the cabin felt like a tomb.

The weight of the Pulse was stronger here, its presence undeniable. It had corrupted everything, even the memories she had clung to. Sari’s gaze fell on the mantle, where a **clock** stood, its hands frozen in place. 

It wasn’t just frozen. Time itself felt different here—warped, distorted. She could feel it in her bones, in the way the air seemed to still around her, trapping her in a moment that refused to move forward.

Sari reached for the clock, her fingers trembling. Before she could touch it, the hands jerked forward, spinning wildly before stopping again, locked in place.

Time had no meaning here. The Pulse had taken control.

And then she saw him.

Talon stood by the window, his back to her, his silhouette familiar but distant. His shoulders were hunched, his head tilted as though he was listening to something only he could hear. 

Sari’s heart twisted in her chest. **Talon.**

“Talon?” Her voice was barely a whisper.

He didn’t move.

She took a step closer, her heart pounding. “Talon, please… it’s me.”

For a moment, he turned, just enough for her to see his face. There was a flicker of recognition in his eyes—a brief, fleeting moment where he was **himself** again. But it was gone as quickly as it had come.

“Don’t,” he whispered, his voice distant, **warped**. “Don’t let it win.”

The temperature in the room plummeted, a sudden, sharp cold that took her breath away. She could see her breath fog in the air, but she barely noticed it. All she could see was Talon—or what was left of him.

The Pulse had consumed him, twisted him into something unrecognizable. The man she loved was slipping away, and she was powerless to stop it.

Sari’s chest tightened, the weight of it crushing her. She had come all this way, fought so hard, but for what? To lose him to this… thing?

But she couldn’t give up. Not yet. Not when there was still a chance—no matter how small—that she could bring him back.

### **Chapter 3: The Reappearance**

The forest felt heavier now, the fog thicker and more oppressive than before. Every step was a battle against the Pulse’s growing influence. It pulsed through the ground, through the trees, through her bones, making it hard to tell what was real and what was just a product of the Pulse’s manipulation.

Sari stumbled forward, her breath coming in ragged gasps, her legs trembling beneath her. She was close now. She could feel it.

A **shadow** flickered in the distance, just at the edge of her vision. She froze, her heart pounding in her chest. The figure was there, but when she blinked, it

 was gone, swallowed by the fog.

The feeling of being watched pressed down on her, suffocating. The forest was alive, and it was watching her, waiting.

She took another step, her eyes scanning the trees, searching for any sign of Talon. But all she saw were shadows—shadows that moved when they shouldn’t have, shapes that twisted and flickered in the fog.

The Pulse was playing with her, twisting reality, bending the world around her. She could feel it gnawing at the edges of her mind, trying to break her, to make her doubt everything she knew.

And then she saw him.

Talon stood at the edge of the clearing, his back to her. His body was rigid, his movements slow and unnatural. The Pulse had taken him deeper now, twisted him into something barely recognizable.

“Talon,” she called out, her voice trembling.

He didn’t turn.

She took a step closer, but the ground beneath her shifted suddenly, a **pulse of energy** rippling through the earth. The trees around her groaned, their branches creaking under the weight of the Pulse’s power.

“Talon, please… I’m here.”

This time, he turned. But when he spoke, his voice was no longer his own. It was **distorted**, a low, guttural sound that sent chills down her spine.

“Sari… you can’t… save me.”
