**Chapter 8: The Pulse Awakens**

The cliffs stretched out before them like the edge of the world, a silent fortress that seemed untouched by the chaos they had escaped. For a moment, standing there in the stillness, Sari allowed herself to believe they were safe. The Pulse had retreated, and the fog had thinned, leaving the air clear and cool. The light from the lanterns flickered gently in the wind, casting long shadows across the rocky ground.

Sari sat beside Talon, who leaned heavily against her, his breath still ragged but calmer now. He was here. That was what mattered. She squeezed his hand gently, a silent promise that they were going to make it through this.

Griffin stood at the cliff's edge, scanning the horizon with a frown. He hadn’t said much since they’d arrived, his body tense, his eyes narrowed as if expecting the Pulse to reappear at any moment. Dystiny, sitting on a boulder nearby, kicked her legs lazily, her usual spark of energy still dampened by the ordeal they’d been through.

“This place is kinda beautiful,” Dystiny said, her voice breaking the silence. “I mean, aside from the whole impending doom thing.”

Sari smiled weakly, appreciating the attempt at lightening the mood. The cliffs were beautiful—rugged, wild, and untouched by the Pulse’s dark influence. The wind whipped through the air, carrying the faint scent of saltwater from the distant ocean. For the first time in what felt like ages, she could breathe without the weight of fear pressing down on her chest.

But the peace didn’t last.

Griffin turned suddenly, his eyes flashing with urgency. “We’re not alone.”

Sari’s heart skipped a beat, her body tensing. “What do you mean?”

Griffin pointed toward the horizon, where a faint, shadowy figure moved through the mist, walking slowly but purposefully toward them. Sari’s stomach twisted as the figure grew closer, its shape becoming more defined.

“It’s not the Pulse,” Griffin said, his voice tight. “But it’s… something.”

Dystiny stood up, her eyes wide. “What the hell is that?”

The figure emerged from the mist, stepping onto the rocky cliff with slow, deliberate movements. It was a man—tall, broad-shouldered, and wrapped in a dark cloak that fluttered in the wind. His face was hidden beneath the shadow of a hood, but Sari could feel the coldness radiating from him, like he carried the essence of the Pulse with him.

Griffin stepped forward, placing himself between the figure and the rest of the group. “Who are you?” he demanded, his voice firm, though Sari could hear the edge of uncertainty in it.

The figure stopped a few feet away, his head tilted slightly as if considering the question. When he spoke, his voice was low and calm, but there was something unsettling in it—something ancient. “I am merely a witness.”

“A witness to what?” Griffin asked, his body tense, ready for a fight.

The man’s head tilted further, and Sari could just make out the hint of a smile beneath the hood. “To the inevitable.”

Sari felt a chill run down her spine. “What do you mean?”

The figure’s gaze shifted to her, and for a moment, she felt as though he could see right through her, as if he knew every thought that crossed her mind. “The Pulse cannot be escaped,” he said quietly. “It is not just a force. It is life itself. It will find you again.”

Talon stirred beside her, his body stiffening at the man’s words. “We beat it once,” he rasped, his voice rough. “We’ll beat it again.”

The man chuckled softly, a sound that sent shivers down Sari’s spine. “You cannot defeat what is part of you. The Pulse does not merely feed on your emotions. It is intertwined with them. It is your fear, your doubt, your anger. It is every part of you that you try to hide.”

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest. The man’s words hit too close to the truth. She had felt it—the way the Pulse had clawed at her mind, pulling at her darkest fears, her deepest insecurities. It had known her in a way nothing else ever had.

Griffin clenched his fists, stepping closer to the man. “We’re not afraid of you or the Pulse.”

The man’s smile widened. “You should be. The Pulse has awoken, and it grows stronger with every breath you take. The more you fight it, the stronger it becomes. It feeds on your resistance, on your struggle.”

Sari’s stomach churned. “What do you want from us?”

The man’s gaze lingered on her for a long moment, his eyes dark and unreadable. “I want nothing,” he said simply. “I am merely here to watch. To see how long you can last.”

Dystiny took a step forward, her fists clenched at her sides. “Well, you can watch us shove that Pulse right back into whatever hellhole it came from.”

The man chuckled again, his voice low and cold. “Perhaps. But the Pulse is not something you can destroy. It is not something you can fight in the way you imagine. It is eternal. It is you.”

With that, the man turned and began to walk away, his form slowly fading back into the mist as if he had never been there at all.

Sari stared after him, her heart pounding in her chest. His words echoed in her mind, sending waves of doubt crashing through her. The Pulse was part of them? Part of her?

Griffin’s voice snapped her back to reality. “We need to move. Now.”

Sari blinked, her mind racing. “Move? Where?”

Griffin didn’t hesitate. “We can’t stay here. If what he said is true, the Pulse is still coming for us. We need to stay ahead of it.”

Dystiny groaned, throwing her hands in the air. “Great. So we’re just going to keep running? Running from something we can’t fight?”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “We’re not running. We’re surviving. There’s a difference.”

Sari looked down at Talon, who was staring at the ground, his face pale and drawn. He hadn’t said a word since the man had left, but she could see the fear in his eyes, the way his body trembled.

“Talon?” she whispered, her heart aching at the sight of him. “What do we do?”

Talon shook his head, his voice barely audible. “I don’t know.”

The weight of his words settled heavily over them all. Talon, who had always been their rock, their strength, was just as lost as the rest of them. 

Griffin looked at the horizon, his face hardening. “We don’t have time to figure it out right now. We need to move before the Pulse catches up with us.”

Sari nodded, though her mind was still spinning. The cliffs had felt safe, but the man’s words had shattered that illusion. The Pulse wasn’t done with them. It wasn’t just waiting. It was part of them. 

As they gathered their things and prepared to leave, Sari couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched. The man’s presence lingered, his voice echoing in her mind.

The Pulse does not merely feed on your emotions. It is intertwined with them.

She took a deep breath, pushing the fear down. She couldn’t afford to fall apart now. Not when they were so close.

But as they left the cliffs and moved back toward the wilderness, Sari couldn’t help but wonder if the man had been right. 

How could they fight something that was part of them?
