**Chapter 2: The Cabin of Dreams**

The cold didn’t leave Sari’s skin as they retreated into the safety of the half-built cabin. Griffin followed close behind, his eyes scanning the fog-thickened forest for any sign of Talon, but it was no use. The Pulse had him now, and the distance between them seemed as insurmountable as the choking fog that had swallowed Talon whole.

Sari stopped in the middle of the room, her chest tight with the weight of their dream, now half-realized, hanging around them. The walls, unfinished and crooked, told the story of everything they’d worked for. The floor creaked under her feet as if reminding her that this place had never been more than a wish—something they’d held onto in the face of too many failures.

The silence stretched, broken only by the faint wind and the slow, rhythmic groan of the cabin as it struggled to stand against the Pulse’s pressure. 

“I didn’t think it would ever get this bad,” Griffin muttered, his voice low as he glanced out one of the jagged, unfinished windows. The fog curled up against the glass like a living thing, pressing in on them from every side. “Talon... he’s not himself anymore.”

Sari didn’t respond. She stood in the center of the room, her eyes drawn to the bare bones of the cabin. This was supposed to be their sanctuary. Her dream—a place of quiet, of safety, where she and Talon could escape the world. Now it felt like a mausoleum. The empty shell of something that might never be finished.

She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to steady herself. But the cabin pressed in on her, the memories of their dreams mixing with the raw reality of Talon’s absence. Her heart ached with the weight of it.

Griffin stepped closer, his voice soft but edged with the protectiveness that had been his constant. “We’ll get him back, Sari. But you have to let me help you. We can’t do this alone.”

She opened her eyes and looked at him. Griffin’s face was etched with worry, the tension between wanting to help and his own fears pulling at him. She could see the exhaustion there—the weight he carried from the moment they had set out to fight the Pulse. He’d always been the protector, always the one who tried to hold everything together. But right now, even Griffin couldn’t hide how fragile their situation was.

“I know,” she whispered. “But he’s... slipping, Griffin. I can feel it.” Her hands clenched at her sides, the cold air biting into her skin. “He’s always been the strong one for me. I don’t know how to save him.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “He’s not lost yet. You’re stronger than you think, Sari. You’ve always been the one holding us together.”

Sari let out a shaky breath, her mind drifting back to those early days with Talon—the shared moments of laughter, their plans for this cabin, their secret world away from everyone else. She’d believed in him then, and she still did. But the Pulse was different. It tore at people’s souls, ripped them apart piece by piece until they were nothing but hollow shells of who they had once been.

And now it had Talon.

“I just... I don’t know if he’ll ever come back from this,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. Her fingers brushed against the rough wood of the cabin’s frame, a reminder of what they had tried to build together. What she still wanted to build, even now.

Griffin moved to stand beside her, his presence a steadying force. He didn’t say anything for a long moment, just stood there, the weight of the situation hanging between them like the unspoken fear they both shared. 

“He will,” Griffin finally said, his voice firm. “Because you won’t give up on him. And neither will I.”

The words hung in the air, filling the space between them with a fragile sense of hope. It was the only thing they had left.

Before either of them could say anything more, there was a faint sound—a rustling outside, barely audible over the wind. Sari stiffened, her heart skipping a beat. Griffin’s hand shot out, grabbing her arm lightly as he signaled for her to stay still.

The fog thickened at the cabin’s edges, swirling and pressing against the windows like some kind of living entity. And then, from the haze, a figure emerged.

**Talon.**

But something was different.

He stood just beyond the cabin, his silhouette hazy and blurred in the dim light. The fog curled around him like tendrils of smoke, clinging to his body as if refusing to let him go. His eyes, once sharp and full of fire, were dull now, shadowed by something darker—something that belonged to the Pulse.

Sari’s breath hitched, her chest tightening as she took a step forward.

“Talon,” she whispered, her voice trembling.

He didn’t move. Didn’t respond. The fog seemed to thicken around him, dragging him deeper into its embrace. And for a split second, Sari could swear she saw something else—something behind his eyes. A flicker of recognition? Or was it fear?

“We can help you,” Sari said, louder now, desperation creeping into her voice. “You don’t have to do this alone.”

Talon’s lips parted, but no words came. His body stiffened, his hands curling into fists at his sides as if he was fighting something—some invisible force that was pulling him away from them.

“Come inside,” Sari begged, her voice cracking. “Please.”

But Talon didn’t move. He just stood there, caught between the fog and the fading light, his face twisted in a strange, haunting expression. And then, with a slow, deliberate movement, he took a step back.

Sari’s heart shattered in her chest.

“No,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Don’t... don’t go.”

But Talon was already slipping away, his figure fading into the mist, swallowed by the Pulse’s grip.

Griffin’s hand tightened on her arm, pulling her back before she could run after him. “He’s not himself, Sari. We have to wait. We can’t follow him out there.”

She shook her head, her vision blurring with unshed tears. “But what if he never comes back?”

Griffin’s voice was steady but soft, laced with the sadness they both felt. “He will. We’ll bring him back. But not like this.”

Sari stood there, frozen, her gaze locked on the spot where Talon had disappeared. The cabin loomed around her, its unfinished walls pressing in, a reminder of the life they had dreamed of, now slipping further from reach.

And yet, despite the despair that clawed at her chest, she couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere, deep inside, Talon was still there. Still fighting.

She just hoped they could reach him before it was too late.
