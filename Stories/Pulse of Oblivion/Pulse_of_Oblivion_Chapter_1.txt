The small town lay shrouded in an unsettling fog, a precursor to the impending chaos unleashed by the Pulse. Sari Greysun, the group's emotional core, gathered her friends at their usual café, the comforting aroma of coffee mingling with the tension in the air. The café was filled with laughter and warmth, but beneath the surface, a sense of unease lingered as the group navigated the challenges posed by the Pulse.

Sari looked around the table, her heart heavy with the weight of responsibility. She noticed Griffin, always the protector, sitting rigidly as he scanned the room for threats. Talon, the restless spirit, seemed distant, caught between the urge to break free from Griffin’s shadow and the loyalty he felt to his friends. Dystiny brought her impulsive energy, but even she seemed subdued, as if sensing the growing tension. Daniel Graves, their mentor, sat quietly, observing the dynamics at play, his presence a calming influence in the growing storm.

“We need to talk about what’s happening,” Griffin said, his voice low and serious. “The Pulse isn’t just affecting the world; it’s affecting us.”

Sari nodded, feeling the gravity of his words. They had all noticed it—the way the Pulse distorted reality, twisting their perceptions and amplifying their fears. As they shared their thoughts and fears, the café's lights flickered ominously, an eerie reminder of the chaos waiting outside.

“What if it gets worse?” Dystiny asked, her eyes wide with uncertainty. “What if we lose each other?”

Sari reached out, placing her hand on Dystiny’s. “We won’t. We have to stick together, no matter what.”

But even as she spoke, Sari felt a knot of doubt in her stomach. The Pulse was relentless, and its power was growing. They needed a plan, a way to fight back against the darkness that threatened to consume them.

As they left the café, the fog thickened around them, cloaking the world in shadows. Sari’s heart raced, her instincts telling her that this was just the beginning. The Pulse was out there, watching, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They would have to be ready.
