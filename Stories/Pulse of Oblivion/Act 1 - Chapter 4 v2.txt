**Chapter 4: Out of the Mist**

The air was thinner at higher ground, but the fog still clung to the earth like a predator lurking in the shadows. Sari’s legs burned with each step as they ascended the rocky path, her breaths coming in shallow, ragged gasps. The climb was steep, and the sharp wind that whipped through the trees stung her cheeks, but she pressed on, determined not to be the weak link in their group.

Griffin led the way, his pace steady and purposeful, his eyes scanning the path ahead for any sign of danger. He hadn’t spoken much since their encounter with the creature, but Sari could feel the tension radiating off him. Every muscle in his body was tight, his grip on his flashlight never loosening. He was waiting for something—anything—to go wrong.

Dystiny brought up the rear, her usual energy dampened by exhaustion. She had been quieter than usual, her face pale and drawn, but Sari knew better than to ask if she was okay. They were all running on fumes at this point, and there wasn’t much room for reassurance.

They had been walking for hours, and while the climb had kept them away from the worst of the fog, there was no telling how far the Pulse could reach. It was always there—watching, waiting.

“Griffin,” Sari called out, her voice barely above a whisper. “How much farther do you think we can go?”

Griffin didn’t slow down or turn around, but his voice came back low and steady. “We’ll keep moving until we find a place that feels safe.”

Safe. The word felt foreign to Sari now. What did safety even look like in a world where the fog could come alive and turn loved ones into monsters?

The path narrowed as they reached a steep incline, the rocks slick with moisture from the fog that had crept up earlier. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she followed Griffin’s lead, placing her hands on the cold stone to keep her balance. She felt Dystiny close behind her, breathing heavily, but neither of them said anything. There was nothing to say.

Finally, after what felt like hours, they reached a small plateau—a flat stretch of rock overlooking the valley below. The fog was thinner here, swirling lazily far beneath them, and for the first time in what felt like days, Sari could see the landscape stretched out before them. Jagged mountains loomed in the distance, their peaks disappearing into the clouds, and dense forests stretched for miles, broken only by the occasional clearing.

Griffin stopped at the edge of the plateau, his eyes scanning the horizon. “We’ll rest here.”

Sari dropped to the ground, her legs trembling from the climb. Her heart was still racing, and her body ached, but the view offered a brief reprieve from the constant pressure of the Pulse. For a moment, she allowed herself to breathe.

Dystiny sat beside her, leaning back against the rock with a groan. “I swear, I’m not built for mountain climbing.”

Sari smiled weakly, though the tension in her chest hadn’t fully eased. “I didn’t know we’d have to do this much running when we came out here.”

Dystiny gave a small, bitter laugh. “Neither did I. I was hoping for more ‘sitting by a campfire and roasting marshmallows’ and less ‘running for our lives from creepy fog monsters.’”

Griffin crouched down a few feet away, setting his flashlight aside as he pulled out a small canteen of water. He took a long drink before handing it to Sari. “Drink. You’ll need your strength.”

Sari nodded, taking the canteen and sipping from it gratefully. The water was cold and refreshing, easing the dryness in her throat. She passed it to Dystiny, who took it without a word.

The wind howled around them, the only sound breaking the silence as they sat there, catching their breath. The plateau felt safe for now, but Sari couldn’t shake the feeling that it was only a matter of time before the Pulse found them again.

“We’re not going to find him by just running, are we?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Griffin didn’t answer right away, his eyes still focused on the horizon. “No. But we need to get somewhere where we can think. Where we’re not being hunted.”

Dystiny sighed, wiping her face with her sleeve. “I hate to break it to you, but I don’t think there’s anywhere like that anymore. Not with that thing out there.”

Sari’s chest tightened. Dystiny was right. The Pulse wasn’t just some storm they could outrun—it was everywhere. And it had taken Talon.

“I don’t know how much longer we can keep going like this,” Sari admitted, her voice shaky. “What if we don’t find him?”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t turn to face her. “We’ll find him.”

Sari bit her lip. She wanted to believe him. She wanted to believe that Talon was still out there somewhere, waiting for them. But the memory of the creature they had encountered earlier—the way its body had twisted in the fog, the way it had screamed—kept replaying in her mind.

What if Talon had become something like that?

The thought sent a wave of nausea through her, and she forced herself to stand, shaking off the fear that clung to her like the fog. She couldn’t think like that. She couldn’t let herself fall apart, not now.

“I’m going to check the perimeter,” she said, more to distract herself than anything. “Make sure we’re alone.”

Griffin gave her a brief nod but didn’t say anything. Dystiny just closed her eyes, her body sagging against the rock.

Sari picked up her flashlight and walked toward the edge of the plateau, her footsteps echoing in the silence. The wind had picked up again, sending chills through her body as she approached the cliffside.

For a moment, she stood there, staring out at the valley below. The fog moved slowly beneath them, swirling like a living thing, but from up here, it seemed almost harmless—like a distant memory of a nightmare she had once had.

But she knew better.

Her thoughts drifted back to Talon—how he had disappeared into the fog without a word. She could still see his face, the way his eyes had changed, the emptiness that had replaced the warmth she had always known. It was like he had already been gone long before the Pulse took him.

Sari clenched her fists, her chest tightening. She couldn’t lose him. Not like this.

Suddenly, a low, distant sound broke through the wind—a rumbling, like thunder rolling through the mountains. Sari’s breath caught in her throat, and she turned toward the sound, her eyes narrowing.

The fog below was shifting, moving faster now, as if something was stirring within it. Her heart pounded as she stepped closer to the edge, her flashlight sweeping across the valley.

And then she saw it.

Far in the distance, something was moving through the fog—something large. It was too far away to make out clearly, but its massive form cut through the mist like a shadow, its movements slow and deliberate.

Sari’s blood ran cold.

It wasn’t just the fog that was alive. There was something inside it.

She stumbled back from the edge, her heart racing. “Griffin!” she called, her voice trembling. “There’s something down there!”

Griffin was beside her in an instant, his eyes following the direction of her flashlight. He didn’t speak, but Sari could see the tension in his jaw, the way his body stiffened at the sight of the distant shape.

Dystiny joined them, her face pale. “Please tell me that’s not what I think it is.”

Griffin didn’t answer. He just stood there, staring at the fog as it shifted and churned, his eyes locked on the massive form moving through the mist.

Sari’s pulse raced. The creature was far away now, but it was heading toward them, cutting through the valley like a force of nature.

“We need to move,” Griffin said finally, his voice low and urgent.

Sari nodded, her body trembling with fear. “Where do we go?”

Griffin glanced toward the mountains, his face grim. “Up. We keep climbing.”
