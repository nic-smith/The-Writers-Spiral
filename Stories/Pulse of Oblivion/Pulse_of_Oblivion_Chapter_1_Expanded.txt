The town was quiet, too quiet for a Saturday evening. The sun had long set behind the dense cover of clouds, casting the world in a dull, ashen glow. Shadows clung to the narrow streets, wrapping themselves around the corners of the old buildings, while a fog, thick and unnaturally cold, crept through the alleys like a living thing. It felt as though the world itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. And, deep down, Sari Greysun knew that something already had.

Sari sat at the corner booth of The Lantern’s Light, the café where she and her friends had spent countless hours over the years. It was their sanctuary, a place that felt untouched by the outside world. But not tonight. Even the familiar smell of coffee and pastries couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over the group. She looked around the table, trying to gauge the mood of her friends, but it wasn’t difficult to see that they all felt it too.

Griffin Blake sat closest to the door, his eyes constantly flicking towards the window, his jaw set in a hard line. Ever the protector, Griffin was always on alert, always ready to step in front of danger. Tonight, though, his usually calm demeanor seemed strained, like a bowstring pulled too tight. His fingers tapped restlessly on the edge of the table, a habit Sari knew well. It meant he was worried.

Across from Griffin, Talon Mercer slouched in his seat, arms crossed over his chest, his gaze distant. Talon was always a little detached, the kind of person who preferred to walk his own path, but recently it felt like he was slipping further away. Sari had known him since they were kids—back when they spent entire summers exploring the woods, dreaming about the adventures they would have when they grew up. But those days felt far away now. Talon hadn’t been the same since his brother died, and the Pulse, whatever it was, wasn’t helping.

Next to Talon, Dystiny O’Connell shifted restlessly, her fingers drumming a rapid rhythm on the table. She was impulsive, always acting before thinking, but that had been part of her charm. At least, it was before the Pulse. Now her restlessness seemed more like a nervous energy, a spark waiting to ignite. Sari knew Dystiny was scared, though she would never admit it. And for good reason. They all had reason to be scared.

Sitting beside Sari was Daniel Graves, the quiet observer of the group. Older than the rest of them by a good twenty years, Daniel had fallen into the role of mentor, though he never seemed to want it. He had a way of calming things down, of making them see sense when emotions ran high. But tonight, even Daniel seemed on edge. He had barely spoken since they sat down, his dark eyes watching, waiting.

It was Griffin who finally broke the silence. "We need to talk about what’s happening," he said, his voice low, but firm. "The Pulse is getting stronger. It's not just affecting the town anymore. It's messing with us."

Sari felt a shiver run down her spine at his words. She had known something was wrong for a while now. The strange things they’d been seeing—the distortions, the way time seemed to bend and stretch—it was getting worse. More frequent. More real.

Dystiny snorted. "Messing with us? Try screwing with our heads. It’s like it’s…alive or something." She shook her head, running her hands through her short, choppy hair. "I mean, does anyone even know what it is?"

Daniel leaned forward slightly, his voice calm and steady. "The Pulse is... difficult to understand," he said slowly. "But we know this much: it feeds on fear. Conflict. Emotions. The more we let it get to us, the stronger it becomes. We have to stay focused. Grounded." He paused, his gaze flickering to Griffin. "That’s why we can’t turn on each other."

Griffin’s jaw clenched. "I’m not turning on anyone, Daniel. I’m just saying we need to be prepared. This isn’t something we can just wait out."

"Prepared for what, though?" Talon’s voice was quiet, but there was an edge to it. He hadn’t looked up from his spot on the table. "How do you fight something you can’t even see?" His words hung in the air like a challenge.

Sari watched Griffin’s face harden. "You don’t fight it by sitting back and doing nothing, that’s for sure." His gaze shifted to Talon, and for a moment, Sari thought he might say something else, but he didn’t. The tension between them was thick, a constant undercurrent that had been growing for weeks. She could feel it, and she wasn’t sure how much longer they could keep it contained.

She cleared her throat, drawing their attention. "We need to figure out what we’re going to do," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "We can’t just keep pretending everything’s normal when it’s not. We need a plan." Her eyes swept the group, landing on each of them in turn. "We stick together, no matter what. That’s the only way we get through this."

For a moment, no one spoke. Then, Dystiny sighed and leaned back in her seat. "I don’t know, Sari. I don’t even know what we’re supposed to be fighting."

Sari opened her mouth to respond, but the words died in her throat as the lights above them flickered once, then twice, before plunging the café into darkness. The sudden shift was disorienting, and for a heartbeat, all Sari could hear was the sound of her own breathing. Then, from outside, a deep, low rumble echoed through the streets, a sound so unnatural that it made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

"What the hell was that?" Dystiny’s voice was a whisper, but it carried in the silence.

Griffin was already on his feet, moving towards the window, his silhouette barely visible in the faint light from the streetlamps outside. "It’s starting again," he muttered, more to himself than anyone else.

Sari pushed herself out of her seat, her heart pounding in her chest. The Pulse was here. Whatever it was, it had found them. She could feel it, pressing in on the edges of her mind, distorting the world around them. The fog outside seemed to thicken, swirling like smoke caught in a slow-motion dance. She didn’t want to go out there, but she knew they had no choice.

"We have to leave," Griffin said sharply, turning back to the group. "Now. Before it gets worse."

Sari hesitated. "Where are we going to go? It’s everywhere. We can’t outrun it."

Griffin’s eyes were hard, determined. "We don’t have to outrun it. We just have to stay ahead of it. Keep moving, keep fighting. If we sit here and do nothing, it’ll tear us apart."
