**Chapter 1: Into the Fog**

The dense fog curled around Sari's ankles, cold and unforgiving, as she darted through the shadowy forest. Her breath came in shallow gasps, the weight of fear pressing against her chest, tightening like a vise. The Pulse was near—she could feel it, not just in the sudden drop in temperature but in the way the trees bent unnaturally, their branches twisting as if trying to flee. 

Sari didn’t look back. There was no time. She had to find him. She had to find **Talon**.

The thick fog clawed at her, distorting the forest into a shifting maze. Shadows danced in the corners of her vision, but she forced herself to focus, pushing past her growing panic. **Talon’s face** flashed in her mind—his guilt-ridden eyes, the weight of his past hanging between them like an unspoken curse. Sari’s chest tightened, not from fear but from a deep, aching frustration. She needed him to **fight**. Not for her, but for himself. 

Ahead, a shape moved between the trees, barely visible through the rolling fog. **Griffin**, tall and imposing, his protective gaze scanning their surroundings, paused just ahead. He waited for her, his usual anxious eyes softened by concern. Even in the chaos, he was a steady presence. But Sari didn’t slow.

“We’re close,” she muttered as she passed, more to herself than to him. Griffin fell into step beside her, his strides matching hers, his face taut with worry.

“Sari, we need to regroup.” His voice was low, urging caution, but Sari shook her head.

“No. We’re almost there. Talon needs us.”

Griffin hesitated but followed, his instincts urging him to stay close. He hated this—being here, in the midst of this madness. But leaving Sari wasn’t an option. Not now. Not after everything. His protectiveness had always been his strength, but now it felt like a curse. He couldn’t lose her. Not like Emma.

The trees opened into a small clearing, their twisted trunks reaching skyward like skeletal hands. Sari stopped, her breath hitching in her throat. There, near the edge of the clearing, was the **half-constructed cabin**. Their cabin.

It was an echo of the dream they’d shared as children—an escape, a sanctuary. But now it stood half-built, a broken symbol of everything they had failed to protect. Sari swallowed the rising tide of despair and pushed forward, the cabin calling her closer like a beacon of false hope.

Griffin’s hand brushed her arm, his touch grounding her. “Sari—”

“I know,” she cut him off, her voice soft but determined. “I know.”

Before either of them could say more, a figure emerged from the fog.

**Talon**.

But he wasn’t the Talon she remembered.

His face was pale, the sharp angles of his jaw tense as if he were holding back some invisible force. His eyes, once full of warmth and light, were shadowed, reflecting the eerie glow of the Pulse that hummed behind him. He looked... haunted.

Sari’s heart clenched. “Talon...”

He didn’t respond. His eyes flicked between her and Griffin, his lips parted as if he wanted to say something, but nothing came. The fog swirled around him, thickening, making it hard to tell where the forest ended and Talon began.

Griffin stepped forward, instinctively placing himself between Sari and Talon. “We’re here to help,” Griffin said, his voice steady, but there was an edge of caution. “But you need to come with us.”

Talon’s gaze flicked to Griffin, something sharp flashing in his eyes. Anger? Resentment? Whatever it was, it was gone just as quickly. His voice, when it came, was a low rasp. “You can’t help me.”

“Yes, we can,” Sari said, taking a step forward, her voice soft but insistent. “Talon, we can face this. Together.”

Talon’s expression twisted, his fists clenching at his sides. “I’m not the same, Sari. The Pulse... it’s inside me. I can’t... I can’t control it.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to tell him everything would be okay, but the words wouldn’t come. Her mind raced, trying to find a way through the fog—both literal and metaphorical. She couldn’t lose him. Not to this.

Behind her, the forest groaned, the trees bending and creaking as the Pulse’s influence grew stronger. The cabin’s walls seemed to breathe, the unfinished wooden beams warping under the strain of the energy swirling around them.

Griffin’s hand tightened into a fist. “We need to move,” he said, his voice low but urgent. He glanced at Sari, his protectiveness warring with his need to trust her judgment. “Now.”

But Sari wasn’t ready to leave. Not yet. She stepped forward, her eyes locking with Talon’s, her voice barely above a whisper. “You’re not alone, Talon. Not anymore.”

Talon’s jaw tightened, his eyes clouded with self-doubt. He wanted to believe her—she could see it in the way his shoulders sagged, in the way his breath hitched—but the Pulse’s grip on him was strong. Too strong.

The fog thickened, wrapping around them like a shroud, and for a moment, Sari could almost hear it—the Pulse, whispering, taunting, feeding off their fear. She shivered.

Talon shook his head, stepping back into the fog. “I can’t...”

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest. She couldn’t lose him. Not now. Not like this. “Talon, please.”

But before she could say more, the Pulse surged. The ground trembled beneath them, and the cabin’s walls groaned as if they were about to collapse. Talon’s eyes widened in panic, and then he was gone—swallowed by the fog, disappearing into the shadows.

Sari took a step forward, her breath catching, but Griffin was there, pulling her back.

“We can’t follow him. Not now.” His voice was firm, but there was a sadness in his eyes, a deep understanding of the pain she was feeling. “We’ll find him. But not like this.”

Sari blinked back tears, her throat tight. She nodded, even though every part of her wanted to run after Talon, to pull him out of the fog and hold him until the Pulse was gone. But she couldn’t. Not yet.

As they turned to leave, the fog parted just enough for Sari to catch one last glimpse of the cabin—their dream. But now, it was twisted, warped by the Pulse’s power, a haunting reminder of what they had lost.

Sari closed her eyes, steeling herself for what was to come.

They weren’t done yet. Not by a long shot.
