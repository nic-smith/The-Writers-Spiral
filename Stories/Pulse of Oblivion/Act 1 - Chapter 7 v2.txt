**Chapter 7: Shadows in the Dark**

The darkness inside the cave felt heavier than the cold outside. The weak beam of Griffin’s flashlight did little to push back the shadows that clung to the damp stone walls. The air was stale, thick with the smell of wet earth and something else—something faint but unpleasant, like decay. Sari didn’t say anything, but the weight of the place made her chest tighten. She hated it, but it was the only shelter they had.

The three of them huddled near the back of the cave, close enough to hear each other’s breathing but far enough from the entrance to feel some semblance of safety. The wind howled outside, a constant reminder of how exposed they were.

Sari leaned her head back against the cold stone, her body trembling from exhaustion. The climb had taken everything out of her, and her legs still ached from the strain. She was grateful for the moment of rest, but her mind refused to settle.

Images of the creature they had seen earlier still haunted her. Its glowing eyes, the way it had moved with an unnatural grace despite its hulking form—it wasn’t something she would easily forget. And even now, sitting in the cave, with Griffin and Dystiny nearby, she couldn’t shake the feeling that they were still being watched. 

She glanced at Griffin, who was sitting a few feet away, staring at the entrance with a grim expression. He hadn’t said much since they had entered the cave. His eyes were locked on the swirling fog outside, his body tense, as if ready to spring into action at any moment.

“You think it’s still out there?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Griffin didn’t look at her. He just nodded, his face hard. “Yeah.”

Dystiny, who had been lying on her back, groaned and sat up. “Great. So, what’s the plan then? Just sit here and wait for the next nightmare to show up?”

Sari shot her a look, but Dystiny just shrugged. “What? I’m just saying. We’re stuck in this cave, hiding from God-knows-what, and we don’t even know what’s out there.”

Griffin finally turned his gaze away from the cave entrance, his expression unreadable. “We stay here for a few hours, get some rest, and then we move.”

Sari could see the weariness in his eyes, the same weariness that she felt deep in her own bones. But she also saw something else—determination. Griffin was tired, but he wasn’t going to stop. Not until they found Talon.

“If the fog is part of the Pulse,” Griffin continued, his voice steady, “then it’s watching us. It’s always watching. We need to stay ahead of it.”

Dystiny rubbed her face with both hands, letting out a tired sigh. “Ahead of it? How exactly do we do that when we don’t even know where it’s coming from?”

Sari leaned forward, her hands clasped together. “There has to be a way to outsmart it. The Pulse—it feels like it’s alive. It moves, it adapts. Maybe it has a pattern, something we can exploit.”

Dystiny raised an eyebrow. “You think we can outsmart fog?”

Sari hesitated, her mind racing as she tried to piece together the fragments of what they knew. The Pulse wasn’t just fog. It was something more. Something that fed on their fear, that twisted reality around them. But there had to be a way to fight back. There had to be.

“We’ve already seen how it affects things,” Sari said slowly. “That creature we saw—it’s part of the Pulse. Maybe it’s testing us. Maybe it’s seeing how we’ll react.”

Griffin frowned, considering her words. “Testing us? For what?”

Sari shook her head, frustration bubbling up inside her. “I don’t know. But it doesn’t feel random. The Pulse isn’t just some mindless force. It has intent.”

Dystiny snorted. “Yeah, and that intent is probably to kill us.”

Sari ignored her, her mind spinning. “What if the Pulse is looking for something? What if that’s why it’s doing this?”

Griffin leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. “Looking for what?”

Sari hesitated. She didn’t have an answer. All she had was the nagging feeling that the Pulse wasn’t just about destruction. It was more calculated than that.

Before she could respond, a noise echoed through the cave—a faint, scraping sound, like something heavy being dragged along the stone floor. Sari’s heart skipped a beat, and she froze, her breath catching in her throat.

Griffin was on his feet in an instant, his flashlight pointed toward the entrance. The beam of light cut through the darkness, but the source of the sound remained hidden, just beyond the reach of the light.

“What was that?” Dystiny whispered, her voice trembling.

Griffin didn’t answer. He just kept the flashlight trained on the entrance, his body tense, ready for whatever was coming.

The scraping sound came again, louder this time, and closer.

Sari’s blood ran cold. It was the same sound they had heard before—when the creature had first stirred outside the other cave.

Her body went rigid, every muscle on high alert. She felt her pulse racing in her throat, and her breath came in shallow, uneven gasps. Whatever was out there—it was back.

“We need to move,” Griffin said quietly, his voice tight with urgency.

Sari’s legs felt like jelly beneath her, but she forced herself to stand. Her entire body was trembling, her mind screaming at her to run, but there was nowhere to go. They were trapped.

Griffin motioned for them to move toward the back of the cave, away from the entrance. The scraping sound grew louder, closer, and Sari’s heart pounded in her chest. The creature was here, just outside.

For a moment, there was silence. The wind howled outside, and the fog swirled in the distance, but inside the cave, everything was still.

Then, without warning, the creature’s growl echoed through the cave, low and guttural, sending a wave of terror crashing through Sari’s body. She stumbled backward, her legs shaking as the sound grew louder, filling the cave with its ominous presence.

Griffin’s flashlight flickered, and for a brief moment, they were plunged into darkness.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat, her pulse hammering in her ears. The creature’s growl filled the air, louder now, more insistent.

And then the light came back on.

The creature was in the entrance.

Sari’s heart stopped as she stared at it, frozen in place. Its glowing eyes locked on them, its long, twisted limbs scraping against the stone as it moved toward them.

Griffin stepped in front of her, his body tense, ready to defend them. But there was no fighting this. The creature was too big, too powerful. They had no weapons, no way to defend themselves.

“Run,” Griffin said through gritted teeth. “Get to the back of the cave. Now.”

Sari’s legs moved on autopilot, her body stumbling toward the far end of the cave. Dystiny was already moving, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she scrambled away from the creature.

But before they could reach the back of the cave, the creature lunged.

Its massive body slammed into the stone, sending a shower of rocks and dust raining down around them. Sari’s ears rang with the impact, her vision blurring as she stumbled backward, trying to get away.

Griffin was yelling, but she couldn’t hear him over the sound of the creature’s growls and the deafening crash of stone. She could see him fighting to keep the creature at bay, but it was too big, too strong.

Sari’s back hit the cold stone wall of the cave, and she pressed herself against it, her heart racing. Dystiny was beside her, her face pale with fear, her breath coming in sharp, panicked gasps.

They were trapped.

The creature let out another growl, and this time, Sari could see its claws scraping against the stone, inching closer and closer.

“Griffin!” Sari screamed, but her voice was drowned out by the creature’s roars.

And then, just as suddenly as it had attacked, the creature stopped.

It froze in place, its body trembling, its glowing eyes wide and unfocused. For a moment, it just stood there, its limbs twitching, its head jerking to the side as if it were listening to something only it could hear.

Then, without warning, it turned and bolted, disappearing into the shadows as quickly as it had appeared.

The cave fell silent.

Sari’s breath came in ragged gasps, her body shaking from the adrenaline that still coursed through her veins. She didn’t move. She couldn’t. She was too afraid that the creature would come back.

Griffin lowered the flashlight, his chest heaving with the effort to breathe. “What just happened?”

Dystiny was still pressed against the wall, her eyes wide with disbelief. “Did… did it just run away?”

Sari didn’t answer. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something had just changed. The creature had been about to attack—she had felt it—but then something had stopped it. Something had made it turn away.

Her mind raced, trying to make sense of it, but there was

 no time. They couldn’t stay here any longer.

“We need to go,” Griffin said, his voice hoarse. “Now.”

Sari nodded, her legs trembling as she pushed herself away from the wall. She didn’t know what had made the creature leave, but she wasn’t going to wait around to find out.

They needed to move. Before the Pulse found them again.
