**Chapter 8: The Descent into Uncertainty**

The night had fallen completely, shrouding the mountains in a suffocating darkness. The cold had deepened, biting at Sari’s exposed skin as they hurried away from the cave where the creature had attacked. The air felt heavier now, thick with tension and a creeping sense of dread. Whatever had made the creature leave so suddenly, it hadn’t been an act of mercy. It felt more like a warning.

Griffin led the way, his flashlight cutting through the darkness, the beam flickering as its battery began to drain. They had no choice but to keep moving. The fog still hung in the valley below, swirling lazily, waiting for them to slip. Sari’s mind raced as they descended further down the narrow path, each step feeling more perilous than the last.

Dystiny was quieter than usual, her face pale as she followed behind Sari. There was no room for her usual sarcastic remarks, not after what they had just survived. They had been close to death—too close—and it was starting to feel like their luck wouldn’t hold out much longer.

“We’re going down?” Sari asked, her voice trembling slightly from the cold and exhaustion.

Griffin didn’t look back. “We need to find a safer path. There’s no telling how many more creatures are hiding up there.”

Sari didn’t argue. Her body ached, her mind was frayed, and her heart was heavy with the weight of everything they had seen and everything they still hadn’t. They were no closer to finding Talon, and the Pulse was becoming more dangerous with every passing hour. 

The wind howled around them, tugging at their clothes as they continued to move. The mountains felt like a different world now—hostile, unwelcoming. The fog below had crept higher, tendrils of mist curling along the rocky path as if trying to reach out to them, to pull them back down into the abyss. 

Sari’s heart pounded with every step, the exhaustion making her limbs heavy and slow. She had barely slept, and the constant fear was wearing her down. Her thoughts kept drifting back to Talon—his face, the way his eyes had changed in those last moments before the fog took him. What if they found him, but he wasn’t the same? What if the Pulse had twisted him into something unrecognizable?

The thought sent a shiver down her spine. She didn’t know what was worse—not finding him, or finding him and realizing he was gone.

“We’ll reach a lower plateau soon,” Griffin said, breaking the silence. His voice sounded more distant than usual, strained from the weight of responsibility he had taken on. “We can rest there.”

Dystiny let out a long, frustrated sigh. “I’d kill for a real bed. Or a fire. Or anything that doesn’t involve freezing my ass off.”

Sari managed a weak smile, though the cold had started to seep into her bones. “I don’t think that’s an option right now.”

“I know,” Dystiny muttered. “But it’s nice to dream.”

Griffin’s flashlight flickered again, and Sari’s pulse quickened. They couldn’t afford to lose their only source of light, not in this darkness, not with the fog creeping closer. She could feel its presence pressing against the edges of her mind, a constant reminder of the danger that lurked just beyond their sight.

“How much longer do you think we have before it dies?” Sari asked, nodding toward the dimming flashlight.

Griffin didn’t answer immediately, his eyes scanning the path ahead. “Not long.”

Sari swallowed hard. The thought of being left in complete darkness with the Pulse hunting them was almost too much to bear. But there was no other option. They couldn’t go back, and they couldn’t stay here.

“We just need to make it to the plateau,” Griffin said, his voice firm but low. “We’ll figure out what to do next once we’re there.”

Dystiny snorted, though it lacked her usual humor. “Next step: survive. After that, maybe we’ll get lucky and find a way to outsmart a supernatural fog that wants to eat us.”

Sari didn’t laugh. The weight of what they were up against felt too heavy for jokes now. Her mind raced with the possibilities—what was the Pulse truly capable of? It had created those creatures. It had taken Talon. And it seemed to be toying with them, testing their every move.

The wind picked up again, a cold gust that sent a shiver through Sari’s body. She wrapped her arms around herself, trying to fight off the chill as they pressed forward. The darkness was complete now, the mountains swallowed by it, with only the weak beam of Griffin’s flashlight to guide them.

Suddenly, the light flickered again—this time, longer than before. Sari’s breath caught in her throat, her heart skipping a beat as the beam wavered, casting strange shadows across the rocky path.

“Griffin—” Sari started, but before she could finish, the flashlight went out.

They were plunged into total darkness.

For a moment, everything was silent. The only sound was the wind howling around them, the cold biting at their skin. Sari’s pulse raced, her breath coming in shallow gasps as her eyes darted around, trying to adjust to the sudden blackness.

Then, in the distance, she heard it—the low, rhythmic sound of breathing. Deep and steady, like before.

Her blood ran cold.

“Do you hear that?” Dystiny whispered, her voice trembling.

Sari nodded, though she knew Dystiny couldn’t see her. The sound was unmistakable—slow, deliberate, and far too close for comfort. It was the same breathing they had heard before, back in the cave when the creature had found them.

“Griffin, what do we do?” Sari whispered, her heart pounding.

Griffin’s voice was low, barely audible over the wind. “Stay close. Don’t make any noise.”

The darkness pressed in around them, suffocating in its weight. Sari could feel the fog creeping closer, the cold mist brushing against her skin, making her shiver. She couldn’t see anything, couldn’t hear anything beyond the sound of her own breathing and the distant rumble of the creature.

They were sitting ducks.

“We can’t stay here,” Dystiny hissed. “We need to move.”

“And go where?” Sari shot back, her voice sharper than she intended. “We can’t see anything.”

Griffin remained silent, his breathing steady but tense. Sari could feel his presence beside her, but in the darkness, it was impossible to tell how close they were to the edge of the path. One wrong step could send them tumbling down into the fog.

The breathing sound grew louder, closer. Sari’s pulse quickened, her body trembling with fear. She wanted to move, wanted to run, but she was frozen in place, paralyzed by the knowledge that the Pulse was hunting them.

And then, out of the darkness, a faint light appeared.

It was distant, almost imperceptible at first, but slowly it grew brighter, cutting through the fog like a beacon. Sari blinked, unsure if she was imagining it, but there it was—a soft, glowing light, far off in the distance but unmistakable.

“Do you see that?” Dystiny whispered, her voice filled with equal parts hope and fear.

Sari nodded, her heart racing. The light was real. But what did it mean?

Griffin stepped forward, his body tense, his eyes locked on the distant glow. “We need to move toward it. Carefully.”

Sari hesitated. The light seemed too perfect, too convenient. Was it a trap? Another test from the Pulse? But the thought of staying in the darkness, with the creature’s breath growing louder, made her decision for her.

“Let’s go,” Sari whispered, her voice trembling.

They moved slowly, carefully, their footsteps barely audible against the rocky ground. The light remained distant but steady, a guiding point in the suffocating darkness. Sari’s heart pounded with every step, her breath coming in shallow gasps as they inched closer to the source of the light.

As they walked, the breathing sound faded, replaced by the distant hum of the wind. The fog thinned, parting slightly as they neared the light, and for the first time since the Pulse had overtaken them, Sari felt a flicker of hope.

But something still gnawed at her. The light was too perfect, too well-placed. It beckoned them forward, but for what purpose?

They reached a small clearing, and the source of the light became clear. A lantern sat on the ground, its flame flickering gently in the wind. It was old, rusted around the edges, but it was unmistakably there.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat as she stepped forward, her eyes fixed on the lantern. It didn’t make sense. Who had left it here? And why?

Griffin approached the lantern cautiously, his hand hovering over the flame. “This is a trap,” he said quietly. “It has to be.”

Sari’s stomach twisted. She had known it, but hearing Griffin say it made the reality sink in. The Pulse was watching them, luring them in.

“What do we do?” Dystiny asked, her voice trembling.

Griffin didn’t answer immediately. He stared at the

 lantern, his jaw tight, before finally shaking his head. “We have no choice. We can’t stay in the darkness.”

Sari’s heart pounded as she glanced around, her eyes scanning the surrounding fog. The light had given them a moment of reprieve, but she knew it wouldn’t last. The Pulse was still out there, waiting.

“We follow the light,” Griffin said, his voice steady but grim. “But we stay on guard. Whatever happens next, we face it together.”

Sari nodded, though her fear was still clawing at her insides. The light felt like salvation, but deep down, she knew it was something else—something dangerous.

They had been walking into the Pulse’s trap all along.
