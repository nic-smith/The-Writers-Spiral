**Chapter 9: The Heart of the Pulse**

The air grew heavier with every step. Sari could feel it pressing against her skin, her lungs, her mind. The Pulse was everywhere. It was no longer just a looming storm in the distance—it was inside them, around them, watching their every move.

Griffin led the way, his pace quick and determined, but Sari could sense the unease radiating from him. He hadn’t spoken since they’d left the cliffs, but his eyes were constantly scanning the horizon, as though he expected the Pulse to erupt from the ground beneath their feet at any moment.

Talon walked beside her, his face pale and drawn. He hadn’t said much either, but she could feel the tension in his body, the fear that hung in the air between them. Every now and then, his grip would tighten around her hand, and she would squeeze back, a silent reassurance that they were still here, still together.

Dystiny trailed behind them, her usually bright energy dulled by the weight of everything that had happened. She kicked at rocks as they walked, muttering under her breath, but the fire that usually drove her was missing.

Sari’s thoughts kept circling back to the man on the cliffs. His words haunted her.

*The Pulse is not something you can fight. It is you.*

What did that even mean? How could the Pulse be part of them? She had felt its power, the way it had twisted her emotions, turned her doubts and fears against her. But it wasn’t her. It wasn’t her pain. It was something else—something darker, something that fed on the very things that made them human.

“We need to stop,” Griffin said suddenly, pulling them out of their silent march. He glanced around, his brow furrowed as he took in their surroundings. They had come to a small clearing, the trees thick and gnarled around them. It was sheltered, at least. The wind wasn’t as strong here, and for a brief moment, the oppressive presence of the Pulse seemed to ease.

Sari nodded, grateful for the break. Her legs ached, and her mind was spinning with too many thoughts, too many questions. Talon sank down onto the ground beside her, his body trembling from exhaustion. She sat close to him, her shoulder brushing his as she tried to steady her breath.

Griffin stood with his back to them, his eyes still scanning the trees. Dystiny dropped to the ground a few feet away, letting out a long, frustrated sigh. “So what now? We keep running until the Pulse decides to play nice?”

Griffin didn’t turn around. “We need a plan.”

Dystiny scoffed. “A plan? To fight something that’s apparently part of us? Yeah, good luck with that.”

Sari leaned her head back against the tree behind her, closing her eyes for a moment. She could still hear the man’s voice in her head, repeating those same words over and over.

The Pulse is you.

“We can’t just keep running,” she said quietly, opening her eyes. “He’s right about that. The Pulse isn’t going to stop. It’s not going to leave us alone.”

Griffin turned to face her, his expression hard. “Then what do you suggest we do? Let it take us?”

Sari shook her head. “No. But maybe we need to stop fighting it the way we have been.”

Dystiny raised an eyebrow. “What, you want us to, like, befriend the creepy fog monster? Not exactly my style.”

Sari sighed. “I’m not saying we give up. I’m saying maybe we’ve been going about this all wrong. The Pulse feeds on our emotions, on our fear and anger. But what if that’s not the only thing it can feed on? What if it’s more… connected to us than we think?”

Griffin’s eyes narrowed, but he didn’t dismiss her immediately. “Go on.”

Sari glanced at Talon, her chest tightening as she remembered the way he had fought his way back to them. The Pulse had nearly consumed him, had dragged him into the darkest parts of himself. But he had made it out. “When the Pulse took Talon, it was feeding on his guilt, his fear. But he came back because he remembered what was real. He remembered what we were fighting for. Maybe… maybe that’s the key.”

Dystiny frowned, her arms crossed over her chest. “What, so we fight the Pulse with happy thoughts? That’s a bit cliché, don’t you think?”

Sari shook her head, frustrated. “It’s not about happy thoughts. It’s about facing the things the Pulse is feeding on. If it’s connected to us, then maybe we can use that connection to push it back. We need to stop running from our fears and face them head-on.”

Griffin’s face was unreadable, his gaze steady on her. “You think the Pulse is using our emotions to control us.”

Sari nodded. “Yes. And I think it’s more than that. I think it’s feeding on everything we’re trying to hide. The more we resist it, the more we deny what’s inside us, the stronger it gets.”

Griffin was silent for a moment, his eyes flicking to Talon, who was staring at the ground, lost in thought. “So how do we fight something that’s part of us?”

Sari took a deep breath. “We don’t fight it. We accept it.”

Dystiny’s eyes widened. “Wait, what?”

Sari looked at each of them, her heart pounding. “We stop fighting the Pulse. We stop running from it. If it’s part of us, if it’s feeding on our emotions, then we need to face those emotions. We need to let go of the things we’ve been holding onto. The fear, the guilt, the anger… all of it.”

Griffin’s jaw clenched. “You’re asking us to surrender.”

“No,” Sari said firmly. “I’m asking us to stop running from the things that are holding us back. We don’t surrender to the Pulse. We surrender to ourselves.”

Talon finally spoke, his voice soft but steady. “She’s right.”

Sari turned to him, surprised. He hadn’t said much since they had escaped the Pulse, and she hadn’t been sure how much of this he had absorbed. But now, he looked up at her, his eyes filled with understanding.

“When the Pulse had me,” he said quietly, “it was feeding on my guilt. My fear. But the thing that pulled me back wasn’t just you guys. It was me. I had to let go of the idea that I needed to be strong for everyone else. I had to let go of the guilt I’ve been carrying for years.”

Griffin’s expression softened, but the tension in his body remained. “And you think that will work for all of us? Just… letting go?”

Talon nodded. “The Pulse feeds on the things we’re trying to hide. The things we’re afraid to face. If we stop running, if we face those things… maybe it loses its power over us.”

Dystiny looked skeptical, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes—a hint of understanding, or maybe just curiosity. “So, what? We all sit around and have a therapy session with the Pulse watching?”

Sari smiled slightly, despite the weight of the situation. “Maybe not a therapy session. But we can’t keep fighting this the way we have been. If the Pulse is part of us, then we have to find a way to work through what it’s feeding on.”

Griffin took a deep breath, his shoulders relaxing slightly as he let Sari’s words sink in. “It’s a risk.”

“It’s the only chance we have,” Sari said softly.

For a long moment, no one spoke. The air around them seemed to hum with anticipation, as though the Pulse itself was listening, waiting to see what they would do next.

Finally, Griffin nodded, his face set with determination. “Alright. Let’s try it.”

Sari’s heart swelled with relief, though the fear still lingered. This wasn’t going to be easy. But they had no other choice.

Talon sat up straighter, his hand still gripping hers tightly. “We do this together. No more running. No more hiding.”

Dystiny let out a long breath, her lips quirking into a half-smile. “Well, if we’re going to have an emotional reckoning, might as well do it now.”

Griffin turned toward the trees, his eyes scanning the horizon once more. “The Pulse is coming. It’s time to face it.”
