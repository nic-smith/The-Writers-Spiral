**Chapter 10: Into the Maw**

The man’s smile lingered in Sari’s mind long after they had left him behind. That twisted, unnatural grin felt burned into her thoughts, as though it had embedded itself in the core of her mind, a reminder of the Pulse’s relentless presence. Every step she took was weighed down by the knowledge that the Pulse had touched her. It had slipped into her mind like a parasite, twisting her reality, and she wasn’t sure how much longer she could hold on.

Griffin led the way, his jaw set, his eyes hard as they continued moving forward into the darkness. The glow from the lantern flickered weakly in his hand, casting eerie shadows across the ground as the fog curled around their ankles. It was colder now, the kind of cold that seemed to crawl under your skin, sinking deep into your bones. Even Dystiny, who usually had something sarcastic or defiant to say, was silent. The weight of what had happened pressed down on them all.

They walked in silence for what felt like hours. The fog had thinned slightly, but the tension in the air had grown thick, heavy with the anticipation of whatever the Pulse would throw at them next.

Finally, Griffin stopped, holding up the lantern to survey their surroundings. They had reached another plateau, larger than the ones before, but the landscape here felt different. There was a stillness in the air, a quiet that didn’t belong in the natural world. It felt like the calm before a storm.

“We’ll rest here,” Griffin said quietly, though his voice carried no real sense of relief. His eyes scanned the area, always alert, always ready for the next threat.

Sari sank down onto the cold ground, her body trembling with exhaustion. Her muscles ached, her mind felt frayed, and her pulse still hadn’t returned to normal. The encounter with the man—the way the Pulse had wormed its way into her head—left her feeling raw and vulnerable. She hugged her knees to her chest, trying to hold herself together.

Dystiny dropped down beside her, her face pale but set in a determined frown. “That guy back there… he wasn’t human anymore, was he?”

Sari shook her head, her voice barely a whisper. “No. The Pulse was controlling him.”

Dystiny let out a bitter laugh. “Fantastic. Fog that eats your brain. Just what we needed.”

Griffin crouched down in front of them, his expression hard. “We need to talk about what happened back there. Sari, you said you felt the Pulse inside your mind. Can you explain it?”

Sari bit her lip, trying to find the right words. “It was… like something pressing into my thoughts. At first, I didn’t even realize it was there, but then it started twisting things. Warping reality. I could feel it inside the man, too. It’s like the Pulse is… searching. Testing.”

Griffin frowned, his brow furrowing. “Searching for what?”

“I don’t know,” Sari whispered, her voice trembling. “But it’s not just a force anymore. It’s something more. It’s alive.”

Griffin’s face darkened, and Dystiny shuddered beside her. The Pulse wasn’t just some environmental anomaly. It had intent. It had control. And they were in the middle of its game, whether they wanted to be or not.

“We have to be smarter,” Griffin said, his voice low but firm. “We can’t afford to let it get into our heads again. If the Pulse can control people like that man, it can do the same to us.”

Dystiny shot him a look. “And how exactly do we stop that? I mean, unless you’ve got a magic helmet that blocks fog-induced brainwashing, I’m pretty sure we’re screwed.”

Sari leaned forward, her voice shaking with frustration. “We can’t just keep running. The Pulse is toying with us. It’s leading us somewhere. We need to understand what it wants.”

Griffin gave her a hard look. “And how do you suggest we do that?”

“I don’t know,” Sari admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “But if we keep running blind, we’re just going to get caught in its trap again.”

For a moment, they were all silent, the weight of Sari’s words hanging in the cold air. She was right. The Pulse wasn’t chasing them—it was leading them. Every step they took, every decision they made, had been manipulated. And now, they were standing on the edge of whatever the Pulse had planned for them.

Griffin stood up, pacing for a moment before speaking again. “We have two options. We can keep following the path the Pulse has set for us, or we try to find another way out.”

Dystiny snorted. “Yeah, because wandering off the only path we have in the middle of monster-infested fog seems like a brilliant idea.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “I’m not saying it’s ideal. But if the Pulse is controlling where we go, staying on this path is just walking into its hands.”

Sari felt a wave of nausea roll through her. She knew Griffin was right, but the idea of stepping off the path, of diving deeper into the unknown, terrified her. But staying on the Pulse’s path—it was a death sentence.

Suddenly, a distant rumble echoed through the air, low and ominous. Sari’s heart skipped a beat, and she looked toward the source of the sound. The fog was shifting again, moving in slow, deliberate waves. And somewhere in the distance, something was coming.

Griffin’s face hardened. “We don’t have much time. We need to move.”

Dystiny groaned, pushing herself to her feet. “Move where, exactly?”

Griffin pointed toward a narrow ridge that jutted out from the plateau. “There. We climb. It’s the only way we can get high enough to see what’s coming.”

Sari’s stomach twisted at the sight of the jagged ridge. The climb would be difficult, especially with the fog creeping closer. But Griffin was right—they couldn’t stay here. They needed to see what the Pulse was hiding.

Without another word, they began the climb. The wind had picked up, whipping around them as they ascended the steep ridge, their hands gripping the cold, sharp rock for support. Sari’s muscles screamed in protest, her fingers numb from the cold, but she pushed forward, her mind racing with fear.

They climbed in silence, the only sound the howling wind and their labored breaths. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest, her legs trembling with the effort, but she refused to stop. She couldn’t. Not now.

When they finally reached the top of the ridge, the sight that greeted them made Sari’s blood run cold.

The fog below them had parted, revealing a large, open expanse of land, barren and desolate. And in the center of that expanse stood a massive, black structure—tall and twisted, like a spire rising out of the earth. It pulsed with an eerie light, casting long shadows across the ground, and the air around it seemed to hum with energy.

Griffin’s face was pale, his eyes wide with disbelief. “What… what is that?”

Sari’s stomach churned as she stared at the structure, her mind racing. The Pulse. This was its heart—its center. And whatever was inside that structure, it was what had been pulling them all along.

Dystiny let out a low whistle, her voice shaky. “Well, that doesn’t look ominous at all.”

Sari’s mind whirled with possibilities. The Pulse had led them here, had manipulated every step they’d taken, and now they were standing at the edge of its true power. The black spire pulsed with energy, its twisted form rising out of the earth like a living thing.

“We need to get closer,” Griffin said, his voice tight with determination. “We need to figure out what this thing is and how to stop it.”

Dystiny groaned, running a hand through her hair. “Seriously? You want to get closer to that thing?”

Griffin shot her a sharp look. “If we don’t figure out what the Pulse wants, we’re never going to stop it.”

Sari nodded, though fear gnawed at her insides. She couldn’t shake the feeling that they were walking straight into the Pulse’s final trap, but they had no choice. The Pulse had shown them its hand, and now they had to face it.

They started down the ridge, moving carefully as they descended toward the open expanse below. The fog had thinned here, but the air felt heavy, charged with energy. Sari’s heart raced as they approached the black spire, its twisted form looming over them like a shadow.

As they neared the base of the structure, Sari felt a strange pull—like something was drawing her closer. The Pulse was here, in this place, stronger than it had ever been before.

Griffin stopped a few feet from the spire, his eyes locked on the pulsating black surface. “This is it. This is what’s been controlling everything.”

Sari swallowed hard, her pulse quickening. “What do we do?”

Griffin didn’t answer immediately. He stared at the spire for a long moment, his jaw tight. “We find a way inside. We end this.”

Dystiny snorted, though her voice lacked its usual humor. “Yeah, because walking into the belly of the beast

 always goes so well in horror movies.”

Sari’s stomach twisted as she stared at the spire, its dark surface shimmering with energy. The Pulse had led them here, had manipulated every step they’d taken. But now they had a chance to fight back.

And she wasn’t going to let the Pulse win.

Griffin turned to face them, his expression hard. “This is it. Whatever happens next, we face it together.”

Sari nodded, though fear still gnawed at her insides. She didn’t know what awaited them inside the spire, but she knew one thing for sure.

There was no turning back.
