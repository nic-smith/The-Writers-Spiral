**Chapter 5: Shadows of Doubt**

The storm’s roar was deafening, the swirling vortex of the Pulse swallowing Talon whole in an instant. Sari stood frozen at the edge of the cliff, her heart thudding painfully in her chest as the dark mass writhed and twisted before her. He was gone. Again.

Her knees buckled, and she fell to the ground, the vision board slipping from her grasp, landing in the dirt beside her. It was useless. All of it. Talon had been so close—so close—and yet it hadn’t been enough.

Griffin was beside her in an instant, his hand gripping her shoulder, pulling her back from the edge. His face was hard, his jaw clenched, but beneath the surface, she could see the fear—fear for her, for Talon, for all of them.

“We’ll get him back,” Griffin said, his voice low and firm. “This isn’t over.”

But Sari could only shake her head, her breath coming in short, shallow bursts. It felt over. The Pulse was too strong, too powerful. How could they possibly fight something that could rip Talon away from them like he was nothing?

Dystiny stood a few feet away, her arms crossed tightly over her chest as she watched the storm with wide, fearful eyes. Her usual brightness had dimmed, and for the first time since Sari had known her, she looked lost. Uncertain.

“We can’t stay here,” Dystiny said, her voice trembling. “That thing’s getting stronger. We’re sitting ducks.”

Griffin nodded, pulling Sari to her feet. His grip was steady, reassuring, but Sari could feel the tension in his body. He was afraid too. They all were.

“We need to regroup,” Griffin said, his eyes scanning the horizon. “The Pulse is feeding off our fear. We have to stay clear-headed. We need to figure out what to do next.”

Sari wiped at her eyes, her chest tightening. “But Talon… he’s still in there.”

Griffin’s expression softened for a brief moment, but then he steeled himself. “We’ll get him out. But not like this. Not when it has the upper hand.”

Sari swallowed hard, nodding, though every instinct inside her screamed to run into the storm and pull Talon out herself. But she couldn’t. She had to be smarter than that.

Griffin helped her back toward the cabin, where the walls creaked and groaned under the weight of the storm pressing in around them. Dystiny followed closely, her steps unusually quiet, her mind clearly racing as she tried to process everything that had happened.

As soon as they were inside, Griffin slammed the door shut, though it barely made a difference. The wind rattled the windows, and the Pulse seemed to seep into every corner of the space, making it impossible to forget its presence.

Sari collapsed onto one of the half-finished wooden chairs, burying her face in her hands. It was all too much. She could feel the weight of it crushing her, suffocating her. The cabin, once a symbol of their hopes and dreams, now felt like a prison—a reminder of everything they had lost. Of how helpless they were.

Griffin paced the length of the room, his hand running through his hair in frustration. “We need to figure out why the Pulse keeps targeting him. There has to be a reason it won’t let him go.”

Dystiny leaned against the wall, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. “Maybe it’s not just him. Maybe it’s all of us. The Pulse feeds on emotions, right? And Talon… he’s been through so much. Maybe it’s using that to control him.”

Sari lifted her head, her brow furrowing. “But why Talon? Why not the rest of us?”

Dystiny shrugged. “Maybe because he’s… vulnerable? I mean, he’s been carrying the weight of his brother’s death for years. That kind of grief… it leaves a mark. And the Pulse feeds on that.”

Sari’s heart ached at the mention of Talon’s brother. She had been there for him, had tried to help him through it, but the truth was, she had never fully understood the depth of his pain. Not really. And now, the Pulse had taken advantage of that, sinking its claws into him, dragging him further and further away.

Griffin stopped pacing, his face darkening. “That might be it. Talon’s been holding onto that guilt for so long, it’s made him a target. The Pulse knows how to exploit those feelings.”

Sari stood, the weight of realization settling heavily on her shoulders. “Then we need to help him let go. We need to show him that he doesn’t have to carry that burden alone.”

Griffin shook his head. “It’s not that simple, Sari. Talon’s been dealing with this for years. We can’t just snap our fingers and make it go away.”

Sari clenched her fists, frustration bubbling up inside her. “We have to try, Griffin! We can’t just sit here and let the Pulse win.”

Griffin’s eyes softened, his voice gentler than before. “I know. But we need to be smart about this. The Pulse is feeding off our emotions too. If we go in there without a plan, it’ll tear us apart.”

Dystiny pushed off the wall, her voice firm. “So, what do we do?”

Griffin glanced out the window, his jaw tightening. “We find a way to weaken it. To strip away its power. It’s manipulating our perceptions, our reality. We need to disrupt that.”

Sari’s mind raced, her thoughts swirling as she tried to think of something, anything, that could give them an edge. “What about light? The Pulse feeds on darkness, right? What if we try using light to fight it?”

Griffin frowned, considering the idea. “It’s possible. We know the Pulse reacts to certain frequencies. If we can create a strong enough light source, it might disrupt its hold on Talon.”

Dystiny’s face brightened slightly, a spark of hope flickering in her eyes. “We could rig something up. Maybe use the lanterns from the Festival of Lights. They’re still in storage, right?”

Sari nodded. The Festival of Lights. It had always been a celebration of hope, a way to ward off the dark, to remind the town that no matter how long the night, the light would always return. It was symbolic. Maybe that was exactly what they needed.

Griffin grabbed his pack, his movements swift and determined. “It’s worth a shot. Let’s get those lanterns and see if we can figure something out.”

As they prepared to leave the cabin, Sari glanced back at the vision board still lying on the floor. It was crumpled now, dirt smudging the edges, but the images were still there—the cabin, the trees, the future they had all dreamed of.

She bent down and picked it up, folding it carefully before slipping it into her pack. It wasn’t just a vision board. It was a promise. A reminder of everything they were fighting for.

The walk back to the town was tense and quiet, the weight of what they were about to do hanging over them like a shroud. The wind had died down slightly, but the Pulse’s presence was still palpable, its influence creeping into every shadow, every corner of their minds.

When they reached the town square, the storage building for the Festival of Lights was just ahead, its doors slightly ajar. Griffin moved forward, pushing the door open with a creak, revealing rows of old lanterns, stacked and forgotten.

Dystiny moved quickly, gathering the lanterns with a sense of purpose that Sari hadn’t seen in her since the Pulse had first appeared. “These should work,” she said, her voice tinged with cautious optimism. “We just need to rig them up to a power source.”

Griffin nodded, already pulling wires from his pack, his hands moving with the efficiency of someone who had done this kind of thing before. “I can rig up a generator. It won’t last long, but it might give us enough time.”

Sari watched them work, her mind still racing, still trying to grasp the enormity of what they were about to face. They were going to fight the Pulse. And they were going to bring Talon back.

But deep down, there was a shadow of doubt—a whisper that told her maybe it was too late. Maybe Talon was already too far gone.

She pushed the thought away, refusing to let it take root. Talon wasn’t gone. He couldn’t be. They were going to save him. They had to.

As the last of the lanterns were rigged and ready, Griffin turned to Sari, his eyes dark but steady. “This is it. Are you ready?”

Sari swallowed hard, her heart pounding in her chest. “I’m ready.”

Dystiny nodded, her hands gripping the lantern tightly. “Let’s light this thing up.”

Together, they turned toward the swirling storm in the distance, the Pulse waiting for them like a predator lurking in the shadows.

It was time to bring the light.
