**Chapter 3: The Encounter**

The fog seemed thicker now, suffocating in its weight as it pressed in on them from all sides. Sari’s breath hitched as she stared into the mist, her flashlight trembling in her hand. The dark shape loomed closer, larger than she had imagined—larger than anything human.

Griffin stood still, the beam of his flashlight cutting through the fog like a knife. His breath was ragged, but his body was coiled, ready to spring into action. Whatever was in front of them wasn’t Talon. It wasn’t even close.

Dystiny shifted beside Sari, her voice low but steady. “What the hell is that?”

Sari’s pulse raced. The shape in the fog was moving slowly, deliberately, as if it were sizing them up. Every step it took felt like a hammer striking the earth, the thud of its footsteps sending tremors through the ground beneath them.

“I don’t know,” Griffin muttered, his voice tight. “But it’s not Talon.”

A part of Sari had held on to the hope that Talon was out here somewhere, lost in the fog but still himself. That hope was fading fast. Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t her brother.

The shape moved again, closer now, and Sari could make out more of its form—long, spindly limbs that dragged along the ground, a torso that twisted unnaturally with every movement. It was hunched, but even so, it towered over them, its presence sending a wave of cold terror through her veins.

Griffin took a step back, his voice barely above a whisper. “We need to move. Now.”

Dystiny didn’t argue. Her face was pale, her usual bravado gone. “Where? It’s blocking the way back.”

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she glanced around. The fog was everywhere, and the creature seemed to be herding them, pushing them further into its territory. She swallowed hard, trying to steady her breathing. There had to be a way out. There had to be.

Griffin kept his eyes trained on the creature, his hand tightening around the flashlight. “We go around it. Stay low, stay quiet, and don’t let it see you.”

Sari’s mind raced, but she nodded, her body tense as she crouched down, the fog swirling around her ankles. Griffin moved first, his steps slow and deliberate, his flashlight pointed at the ground. Dystiny followed, her movements quieter than Sari had ever seen them.

Sari held her breath as she moved, her legs shaking with every step. The creature hadn’t reacted yet—it hadn’t noticed them, or at least, it hadn’t made any move to attack. But the fear was there, thick in the air, pressing down on her chest.

They were almost past it when the creature let out a low, guttural sound—a noise that sent a shiver down Sari’s spine. She froze, her eyes wide as she turned her head just enough to see the thing shifting in the fog, its limbs twitching.

Griffin shot her a look, his eyes flashing with urgency. Move.

But before she could take another step, the creature’s head jerked upward, its dark, featureless face turning toward them. Sari’s heart skipped a beat as she stared into the void where its eyes should have been.

And then it screamed.

The sound was deafening, a high-pitched wail that seemed to tear through the fog and into her skull. Sari stumbled backward, her flashlight falling from her hand as she covered her ears, her head spinning.

“Run!” Griffin’s voice cut through the noise, but her body wouldn’t move. The scream was still ringing in her ears, the ground beneath her swaying as the fog seemed to close in tighter around them.

Griffin grabbed her arm, yanking her to her feet. “Sari, we have to go!”

She blinked, her vision blurry, but she forced herself to move, her legs stumbling beneath her as she ran. Dystiny was already ahead of them, her body a blur in the mist. The creature’s scream echoed in her head, chasing them as they fled deeper into the forest.

The trees seemed to close in around them, their twisted branches reaching down like claws, scraping at her skin as she pushed forward. Her lungs burned, and her legs ached, but she couldn’t stop. Not now.

The creature’s footsteps were heavy behind them, its wailing scream growing louder with every second. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest, her breath coming in ragged gasps as they ran. The forest felt like a maze, the fog making it impossible to see more than a few feet ahead.

“We have to lose it!” Dystiny called out, her voice breathless.

Griffin veered to the right, his hand still gripping Sari’s arm as they changed direction. The creature’s footsteps faltered, as if it were trying to follow them but couldn’t quite keep up with the sudden shift.

Sari glanced over her shoulder, her stomach twisting at the sight of the creature still lumbering after them, its limbs dragging across the ground, its head twitching as if searching for them. It was relentless.

“Head for the rocks!” Griffin shouted, pointing toward a small outcropping of jagged boulders jutting out from the fog. “We can hide there.”

They sprinted toward the rocks, their breaths coming in harsh gasps as they clambered up the rough surface. Sari’s hands scraped against the jagged stone, but she didn’t stop. She pulled herself up and ducked behind one of the larger boulders, her heart racing in her chest.

Dystiny and Griffin crouched beside her, their faces pale and drawn. The creature’s footsteps grew louder, but then, suddenly, they stopped.

The three of them held their breath, their bodies tense as they waited. Sari could hear the blood pounding in her ears, the silence of the fog pressing down on them like a weight.

And then, slowly, the creature’s footsteps started again. But this time, they were moving away.

Sari let out a shaky breath, her body sagging against the rock. They had made it. They had escaped.

For now.

### **Aftermath**

The fog hung heavy in the air, but the oppressive sound of the creature’s footsteps was fading. The silence that followed was almost deafening, but it was a welcome relief. Sari leaned her head back against the rock, her body trembling with exhaustion. Her lungs burned, and every inch of her ached, but they were alive.

“That thing,” Dystiny panted, her voice barely above a whisper. “What the hell was that?”

Griffin shook his head, his eyes still fixed on the direction the creature had gone. “I don’t know. But it’s part of the Pulse. It has to be.”

Sari swallowed hard, her throat dry. “If the Pulse can control something like that, then Talon—”

She didn’t finish the sentence. She didn’t have to. The possibility of Talon being twisted into something like that creature was too horrifying to speak aloud.

“We’re going to find him,” Griffin said, his voice firm. “But we have to be smart about this. That thing is out there, and who knows how many more there are.”

Sari nodded, but the fear gnawed at her. The Pulse was getting stronger. They had faced one of its creations, but the Pulse itself was still out there, waiting. Watching.

Griffin glanced at the fading fog and then back at the two of them. “We can’t go back to the cabin. It’s not safe anymore.”

Dystiny’s lips pressed into a thin line. “So, what now?”

Griffin stood up, dusting off his hands. “We keep moving. We find higher ground. And we figure out what the hell we’re really up against.”

Sari’s legs wobbled as she stood, the adrenaline starting to wear off, but she knew Griffin was right. They couldn’t go back. They couldn’t stop.

She took one last look at the fading fog, her heart heavy with fear and uncertainty. The Pulse had shown its teeth, and the game had changed. But Talon was still out there somewhere.

And they weren’t going to stop until they found him.
