**Chapter 4: The Vision Board**

The wind howled around the cliffs, carrying with it the eerie whispers of the Pulse. Sari shivered, pulling her jacket tighter as she stared down into the swirling storm below. Talon’s figure, still barely visible in the chaos, flickered like a mirage—there one moment, swallowed by the darkness the next.

Griffin stood beside her, his face a hardened mask of determination. He hadn’t spoken in minutes, his gaze fixed on the Pulse, as though sheer will alone could bring Talon back. But deep down, Sari knew it wasn’t that simple. It never had been.

Dystiny paced behind them, her boots kicking up loose gravel as she moved. “This is insane,” she muttered, her usual spark of excitement dulled by the gravity of the situation. “How are we supposed to get him out of there?”

Sari turned away from the cliff’s edge, trying to steady her breath, her thoughts. The Pulse was more than a storm. It was a living thing, and it had Talon now—had him in its grip, pulling him deeper into whatever darkness it thrived on.

But there had to be a way. There was always a way. She refused to believe otherwise.

“We can’t just charge in,” Griffin said finally, breaking the silence. His voice was low, measured, but Sari could hear the frustration beneath it. “That thing is feeding off him. Off all of us. If we’re going to save him, we need to be smart about this.”

Sari bit her lip, her mind racing. They needed a plan. Something that could cut through the Pulse’s influence. Something that could bring Talon back from the edge.

Dystiny stopped pacing, her eyes flicking to Sari. “What about the cabin?” she asked, her voice tentative but hopeful. “I mean… we built it as a place to escape, right? Maybe… maybe we can use it somehow.”

Griffin frowned. “How? The cabin’s not going to stop the Pulse.”

Dystiny shrugged, her hands fiddling with the strap of her bag. “Maybe not. But it was more than just a cabin to you guys, right? It was… I don’t know… a symbol? A vision of something better?”

Sari blinked, the words sinking in slowly. Dystiny wasn’t wrong. The cabin had always been more than just wood and nails. It had been a dream—a place where she and Talon could create something beautiful together, where they could be free from everything that had held them back.

She glanced at Griffin, her heart pounding in her chest. “The vision board.”

Griffin looked at her, confused. “What?”

“The vision board,” Sari repeated, her voice gaining strength. “Remember? Back when we first started talking about the cabin, we made that stupid vision board of everything we wanted. It wasn’t just about the cabin—it was about what the cabin represented. Freedom. Stability. A future.”

Griffin’s brow furrowed as the memory came back to him. “You think that’s going to help us now?”

Sari nodded, her mind whirring with possibility. “The Pulse feeds off despair, right? It twists everything, makes you feel like there’s no way out. But what if we fight it with the opposite? What if we give Talon something to hold onto, something that reminds him of why he needs to come back?”

Dystiny’s eyes widened, excitement flickering in her gaze. “Like a mental anchor. Something to pull him out of the darkness.”

Griffin still looked skeptical, but Sari could see the wheels turning in his mind. He was practical, always thinking about the logistics, about the risks. But deep down, she knew he wanted to believe it could work.

“We don’t have much time,” Sari said, her voice steadying as the idea solidified. “We need to recreate the vision board. We need to remind Talon what he’s fighting for. If we can show him that, maybe we can break the Pulse’s hold on him.”

Griffin let out a slow breath, running a hand through his hair. “Alright,” he said finally. “It’s a long shot. But it’s better than doing nothing.”

Sari’s heart lifted, a flicker of hope sparking in the darkness. They had a plan. It wasn’t perfect, but it was something. And right now, that was all they had.

They retreated back to the cabin as the wind picked up, the sky darkening with the approach of the Pulse. The half-constructed walls groaned under the pressure, but inside, it felt warmer—safer. The cabin was incomplete, yes, but it was theirs. It was a reminder of everything they had built together, everything they were still fighting for.

Dystiny rummaged through her bag, pulling out a stack of old papers, markers, and scraps of fabric. “Okay, so we’re doing this vision board thing, right? I’ve got some supplies. Let’s get creative.”

Griffin sat down on the floor, leaning against one of the unfinished walls, his arms crossed over his chest. “This feels a little… ridiculous, you know.”

Sari shot him a look. “It’s not ridiculous. It’s symbolic. Talon needs something to hold onto, and this—this is what we have. We need to remind him of what we were building together.”

Griffin sighed but didn’t argue further. He just watched as Dystiny spread out the materials in the center of the room, her hands moving with an excited energy that felt almost out of place in the dire situation they were facing.

Sari knelt down beside her, grabbing a piece of paper and a marker. She stared at the blank sheet for a moment, her mind racing with everything she wanted to say, everything she wanted Talon to remember. The cabin. Their dream. The life they were supposed to build together.

She drew the outline of the cabin first—simple, rough, but recognizable. And then she added more: trees, the river, the mountains in the distance. The things that had always made them feel alive, made them feel like they belonged somewhere.

Dystiny hummed softly as she worked, her fingers deftly cutting out images from an old magazine she’d found in her bag. “You know, this isn’t half bad,” she said, glancing at Sari with a small smile. “Maybe we should do this more often. You know, like therapy.”

Sari couldn’t help but smile, even though her heart was heavy. “Yeah. Maybe.”

Griffin remained silent, watching them work, but Sari could see the tension in his shoulders easing just slightly. It wasn’t much, but it was something.

When they were done, the vision board lay spread out before them—a chaotic, colorful mix of drawings, cutouts, and scribbled words. It was messy, imperfect, but it was theirs. A reminder of everything they had built together, everything they still had to fight for.

Sari stared at it for a long moment, her chest tightening. “This is it,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “This is what we need to show him.”

Griffin stood up, his face set with determination. “Then let’s go.”

---

They left the cabin once again, the wind roaring around them as they made their way back to the cliffs. The Pulse was stronger now, its presence a tangible weight pressing down on them as they approached. The storm twisted and writhed in the distance, growing darker with every passing second.

And there, in the center of it all, was Talon.

Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as they reached the edge of the cliff. The vision board felt fragile in her hands, but it was all they had. She stepped forward, her gaze fixed on Talon’s figure, still shrouded in darkness.

“Talon!” she called out, her voice carrying over the wind. “Talon, listen to me!”

He didn’t move.

Sari’s throat tightened, but she pressed on, holding the vision board out in front of her like a shield. “This is us! This is what we built together! You can come back! You can fight this!”

For a long moment, there was nothing—just the wind, the storm, the suffocating presence of the Pulse.

But then, slowly, Talon turned.

His eyes, dark and clouded, locked onto hers. And for the briefest moment, Sari thought she saw something—something human, something real.

“Talon,” she whispered, tears stinging her eyes. “Please.”

He took a step toward her.

And then another.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. He was coming back. He was—

The ground shook violently, the Pulse roaring with fury as the sky darkened even further. The storm surged, and Talon was ripped away from the cliff’s edge, swallowed by the swirling mass of darkness.

Sari screamed, but it was too late.

He was gone.
