To reincorporate **Daniel Graves**, the **vision board subplot**, and more **internal conflicts and emotional growth** into the framework while keeping it well-rounded, we need to ensure these elements complement the existing tension and character arcs. Here’s the **revised Act 1 framework** with those key elements seamlessly woven in:

---

### **Revised Act 1 Framework – Pulse of Oblivion**

---

### **Chapter 1-3: Introduction and the Pulse’s Initial Threats**

1. **Introduction of the Group & Dynamics**:
   - The group (Sari, Griffin, Dystiny, Talon, and Daniel Graves) is introduced navigating the tense and distorted world controlled by the Pulse. Their personalities, strengths, and weaknesses are revealed through dialogue and action.
   - **Character Focus**:
     - **Sari** is the emotional core, trying to hold the group together.
     - **Griffin** asserts control, playing the role of protector, while also clashing with Talon.
     - **Talon** is introduced as increasingly independent, resisting Griffin’s authority, creating immediate tension.
     - **Dystiny’s impulsiveness** is highlighted early, bringing a reckless edge to the group dynamic.
     - **Daniel Graves**, a mentor figure, provides a stabilizing influence, acting as the group's calming force. He’s older and experienced, and while not a decision-maker, he often advises and encourages moments of reflection, trying to maintain emotional balance.

2. **Introduction of the Vision Board Subplot (Chapter 2)**:
   - **Vision Board/Goal Visualization Moment**: Early in the journey, Daniel introduces a brief exercise: creating a metaphorical “vision board” where each character expresses their hopes or motivations. This is not a literal board, but more of a symbolic moment. Each person speaks about what they hope to achieve or how they envision life beyond the Pulse.
     - **Sari’s Goal**: Finding Talon and keeping the group together.
     - **Griffin’s Goal**: Protecting everyone and regaining control over their circumstances.
     - **Talon’s Goal**: Proving he can take care of himself, free from Griffin’s overbearing protectiveness.
     - **Dystiny’s Goal**: Rejects the exercise at first, but then confesses she just wants to feel alive and free, untethered by fear.
     - **Daniel’s Goal**: Helping others survive, acting as a mentor to the younger group members.

3. **Pulse Manipulations & Tension Building**:
   - As the group moves through the landscape, the **Pulse** begins distorting reality, testing their emotional resilience. This is where Daniel’s calming influence becomes crucial—he encourages the group to stay grounded in their individual goals, reminding them of their vision board as a way to stay focused.
   - **Internal Conflict between Griffin & Talon**:
     - **Griffin’s Protectiveness**: Griffin continues to act as the leader and protector, but his control over Talon creates tension. Talon resents being treated like a child, and this leads to small arguments. Sari tries to mediate but struggles to get them to open up about their emotions.
     - **Talon’s Independence**: Talon begins pushing back against Griffin’s decisions, choosing to act on his own instincts, which creates risky situations for the group. This sets up his arc of eventual growth.

4. **Daniel’s Role in Emotional Growth**:
   - **Pause Moments**: Daniel encourages **“Pause Moments,”** times where the group must stop, reflect, and address their emotional struggles. He insists they take a moment to talk about their feelings, even when the situation is dire, forcing Griffin and Talon to talk about their conflict.
     - **Griffin vs. Talon**: Daniel’s gentle nudging helps Talon and Griffin begin to understand each other’s motivations. Talon confesses he feels suffocated by Griffin’s protectiveness, while Griffin admits that he’s afraid of losing Talon to the Pulse.

   - The **Pulse** amplifies its psychological attacks, distorting the group's perception of time and space, making them question reality. This pushes the group to confront their inner fears.

     - **Griffin’s Fear**: Griffin sees visions of the group being torn apart due to his inability to lead, fueling his need for control.

6. **Introduction of Nina Cross (End of Chapter 4)**:
   - The group encounters **Nina Cross**, a survivor who has been exposed to the Pulse for far longer than they have. Her knowledge of the Pulse makes her a valuable asset, but her paranoia and trauma create tension.
     - **Nina’s Role**: Nina introduces new information about the Pulse, explaining that it feeds on fear, emotional instability, and conflict within the group. She warns that the Pulse has the ability to manipulate minds, which heightens the group's paranoia.

   - **Her Heroic Sacrifice**: Dystiny creates a distraction, buying the group precious time but at the cost of her own life. Her death is tragic but impactful—she reflects on her own impulsiveness, realizing that while it drove her, it also led to her downfall.
   - **Emotional Fallout**:
     - **Griffin**: Blames himself for not being able to control the situation.
