**Chapter 1: The Cabin of Dreams**

The cold clung to Sari’s skin like a second layer, seeping into her bones despite the walls of the half-finished cabin. It felt as though the fog had found its way inside, pressing against her from all sides, suffocating her under its weight. She shivered, wrapping her arms around herself as she stared at the place they had once dreamed would be their refuge.

Now it felt more like a tomb.

The air inside the cabin was thick with tension. Griffin stood by the makeshift window, staring out into the distance where the forest disappeared into the mist. His broad shoulders were hunched, his fists clenched tightly at his sides as if ready to fight whatever was out there, even though they both knew it was futile.

“Do you think he’s still alive?” Griffin asked, his voice low and rough, the question hanging in the air like a cloud of smoke.

Sari didn’t answer right away. She didn’t want to. She didn’t want to think about what had happened—about the way Talon’s face had changed right before the fog swallowed him whole, his eyes darkening with something unrecognizable, something terrifying. She pressed her lips together, her breath trembling as she fought to keep her emotions in check.

“He’s out there,” Sari finally said, though the words felt hollow, like a lie she told herself to keep from breaking. “He’s out there somewhere.”

Griffin didn’t respond. His jaw tightened, and he turned back to the window, his eyes scanning the thick mist that had swallowed the world outside. The fog had come for them days ago, creeping in slowly at first, like a predator stalking its prey. And then it had struck, tearing Talon away before any of them could react.

Now, all they had left was the cabin—their once-bright hope of freedom and safety, now a bleak reminder of everything that was slipping away.

“We have to find him,” Sari said suddenly, her voice sharper than she intended. “We can’t just stay here and wait for… wait for whatever happens next.”

Griffin let out a bitter laugh, turning away from the window. “And what do you suggest we do, Sari? Go marching out into that?” He gestured toward the fog, his eyes flashing with frustration. “You saw what happened to Talon. You know what’s out there. You want to end up like him?”

Sari recoiled at his words, guilt twisting in her stomach. She knew Griffin wasn’t trying to hurt her, but the truth of his words cut deeper than anything else. She did know what was out there. And it terrified her.

But they couldn’t stay here. They couldn’t just wait.

“I can’t lose him,” Sari whispered, her voice barely audible. She wasn’t sure if she was talking to Griffin or to herself. Maybe both. “Not like this.”

Griffin’s expression softened, and for a moment, the tension between them eased. He stepped toward her, his hand resting on her shoulder. “We won’t lose him. But we can’t just rush out there without a plan. That fog… it’s not natural. There’s something in it. Something dangerous.”

Sari swallowed hard, her mind racing. He was right. The fog wasn’t just some random weather anomaly. It was alive. She had felt it—pressing in on her, pulling at the edges of her mind, making her question what was real and what wasn’t.

And then there was Talon.

The image of him standing at the edge of the clearing, his back to them, his body stiff as the fog crept around him—it was burned into her memory. She had called out to him, but he hadn’t responded. Hadn’t even turned around. And then, when he finally had, his eyes were… wrong. Hollow, like he wasn’t even there anymore. Like something else had taken his place.

The Pulse. That’s what they had started calling it after the first few hours when the fog rolled in—because it wasn’t just a mist. It was something more, something alive. It moved like it was hunting them, its tendrils snaking through the trees, pressing against the cabin walls, waiting for the right moment to strike again.

And it had taken Talon.

“I don’t know what to do,” Sari admitted, her voice shaking. “I don’t know how to fix this.”

Griffin sighed, running a hand through his hair. He looked as exhausted as she felt. “None of us do. But we can’t just charge into the fog blindly. We’ll only make things worse.”

Sari nodded, though frustration gnawed at her. She hated this—this feeling of helplessness, of being trapped. They had built the cabin as a sanctuary, a place where they could finally be free, away from everything that had chased them for so long. But now it felt like a prison, and no matter how hard she tried to fight it, the walls kept closing in.

A sudden sound broke the silence—a faint, distant creak, like the groan of old wood shifting under pressure. Sari’s heart lurched, and she spun toward the door.

Griffin was already moving, grabbing the hunting knife from the table and motioning for her to stay back. The fog was pressing in again, crawling across the porch like a living thing, its pale tendrils snaking toward the cracks in the door.

Griffin cursed under his breath. “It’s getting closer.”

Sari took a step back, her eyes wide as she watched the fog creep toward them. “What do we do?”

Griffin didn’t answer right away. His face was tense, his body coiled with the kind of alertness that told her he was ready to fight—but they both knew there was no fighting this. Not really.

“Get away from the door,” Griffin said finally, his voice low and steady. “We need to stay inside.”

Sari nodded, moving back toward the center of the room. Her mind raced as she tried to think of a way out, a way to stop the fog from coming in, but there was nothing. There was no escaping it. Not without Talon.

Griffin stayed by the door, his eyes trained on the swirling mist just outside. The fog pressed against the windows, thickening by the second, and for a moment, Sari swore she saw something moving in it—something dark and shifting, like a shadow slithering through the mist.

She shuddered, her pulse quickening.

Griffin stepped back from the door, his expression grim. “It’s coming for us.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. “What do you mean?”

“The Pulse,” Griffin said, his voice tight. “It’s not just after Talon. It’s after all of us.”

A cold wave of fear washed over her, and for the first time since the fog had appeared, Sari felt truly terrified. Not just for Talon. For all of them.

The fog pressed harder against the windows, the wood creaking under the pressure. Sari took another step back, her heart pounding in her chest.

“We need to get out of here,” Griffin said suddenly, his voice sharp. “Now.”

Sari nodded, not needing to be told twice. She grabbed her jacket from the chair and moved toward the door, her hands trembling as she fumbled with the zipper.

“Stay close to me,” Griffin said, pulling the door open just enough for them to slip out. “And don’t let the fog touch you.”

Sari’s breath hitched as she followed him out onto the porch. The air was thick and cold, the fog swirling around them like a living entity, reaching for them with tendrils of mist.

They moved quickly, staying close together as they made their way through the clearing toward the tree line. The fog was everywhere now, wrapping around the trees, slithering across the ground like a snake.

And then she saw it—something dark and twisted moving through the mist, just at the edge of her vision.

Sari’s heart raced, and she grabbed Griffin’s arm. “Did you see that?”

Griffin’s eyes narrowed as he scanned the fog. “Yeah. I saw it.”

The Pulse wasn’t just fog. It was something else. Something alive.

Something hunting them.
