Chapter 7: The Calm Before**

The wind had quieted, but the presence of the Pulse still lingered, thick in the air like a storm waiting to break again. The swirling mass of fog had receded, leaving the landscape bathed in an eerie, unnatural silence. Sari sat beside Talon, his head resting on her lap, his breathing shallow but steady. 

Griffin stood a few feet away, his arms crossed as he watched the horizon. His eyes were fixed on the place where the Pulse had retreated, his face grim. They had won this round, but the fight was far from over. The Pulse was still out there, lurking, waiting. And it wouldn’t give up so easily.

Dystiny paced in front of the lanterns, her usual energy dulled by the exhaustion that hung over them like a heavy blanket. She kicked at the dirt, her face twisted in thought. “So… we won, right?” she asked, her voice uncertain. “I mean, Talon’s back.”

Sari glanced down at Talon’s pale face, her heart aching at the sight of him. He looked so fragile, so broken. But he was here. He was with them. That was a victory, even if it didn’t feel like it. 

“Yeah,” Griffin said, though his tone lacked the confidence of someone who believed they had truly won. “For now.”

Dystiny stopped pacing, her hands resting on her hips as she frowned. “For now? What does that mean? We got him out. The lanterns worked. Shouldn’t we be celebrating or something?”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, his gaze still fixed on the horizon. “The Pulse isn’t gone. It retreated, but it’s not finished. It’ll come back.”

Sari felt a shiver run down her spine at his words. He was right. The Pulse wasn’t just some storm they could weather and forget about. It was something bigger, something alive. And it wasn’t going to let them go so easily.

Talon stirred in her lap, his eyes fluttering open. His voice, when he spoke, was weak, barely a whisper. “It’s… still here.”

Sari leaned over him, her hand brushing his hair from his face. “Talon, don’t worry about that right now. You need to rest.”

But Talon shook his head, his eyes clouded with fear and pain. “No. It’s… it’s not gone. It’s just waiting.”

Sari exchanged a worried glance with Griffin, her chest tightening with a mix of fear and uncertainty. If Talon was right—if the Pulse was still waiting, biding its time—then they weren’t safe. None of them were.

Griffin moved toward them, kneeling beside Talon. “What do you mean it’s waiting? What did you see in there?”

Talon closed his eyes, his breath hitching as if the weight of the Pulse’s presence still clung to him. “It’s… hungry. It feeds on us. Our fear, our anger, our pain. It’s… learning.”

Sari’s heart sank. The Pulse wasn’t just some mindless force. It was sentient, adapting, learning from them. She had felt it too, the way it had tried to twist her mind, pulling at her fears, her doubts. And if it was learning, then they were running out of time.

“We need to move,” Griffin said, his voice tight. “If the Pulse is learning, we can’t stay here. We need to find a place it can’t reach.”

Dystiny groaned, dropping to the ground beside the lanterns. “Great. And where, exactly, would that be? It’s not like there’s a lot of options when it comes to hiding from a freaky, emotion-eating fog monster.”

Griffin stood, his hand rubbing the back of his neck as he thought. “We can’t stay in the open. The Pulse is weaker around strong light and energy, but we don’t have enough resources to keep the lanterns running forever.”

Talon stirred again, his voice weak but urgent. “The cliffs…”

Sari frowned, glancing toward the cliffs where they had first seen the Pulse. “The cliffs? What about them?”

Talon’s eyes fluttered open, his gaze locking with hers. “There’s… something there. A place where it can’t reach. I saw it. When I was inside… it couldn’t follow.”

Sari’s heart pounded. “Are you sure?”

Talon nodded, though his movements were slow, as if the effort to speak was draining what little strength he had left. “It’s… the only place.”

Griffin’s brow furrowed, his eyes narrowing as he processed Talon’s words. “The cliffs… if there’s a place where the Pulse can’t follow, that’s our best shot. We’ll have to move quickly.”

Dystiny stood, brushing the dirt from her hands. “And how exactly are we supposed to get there without the Pulse dragging us back into its little foggy hellhole?”

Griffin looked at the lanterns, their soft glow still pushing back the remnants of the fog. “We’ll use the lanterns again. If we can rig up a few more and keep the lights strong enough, we might be able to make it.”

Sari nodded, determination settling in her chest. Talon’s words had given her hope, a glimmer of light in the darkness. If there was a place where the Pulse couldn’t reach, they had to try. It was their only chance.

“We’ll get more lanterns,” Sari said, standing and helping Talon to his feet. He swayed slightly, his body weak from the Pulse’s grip, but he leaned on her for support, his eyes still dark with the lingering effects of the Pulse.

Griffin nodded. “I’ll check the storage sheds for anything else we can use. Dystiny, help me. Sari, stay with Talon. Make sure he’s okay.”

Dystiny saluted with mock enthusiasm. “Aye, aye, Captain. Let’s go raid the storage sheds.”

As Griffin and Dystiny moved toward the sheds, Sari stayed behind with Talon, her hand resting gently on his arm as she guided him toward a small bench near the town square. The weight of his body pressed against her, but she didn’t mind. He was here. That was all that mattered.

Talon sat down heavily, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps. Sari knelt beside him, her hand brushing lightly against his. “You’re safe now,” she whispered, her voice soft. “You’re with us.”

Talon’s eyes fluttered open, his gaze filled with a strange mixture of gratitude and guilt. “I… I didn’t think I’d make it back,” he murmured, his voice barely audible. “I thought the Pulse… I thought it had me.”

Sari squeezed his hand gently, her heart aching at the pain in his voice. “It almost did. But we fought for you. We’re not going to let you go that easily.”

Talon’s eyes filled with tears, his voice trembling. “I’m sorry, Sari. I… I should have been stronger.”

Sari shook her head, her voice firm but gentle. “Don’t say that. You’re stronger than you know. You fought, Talon. You fought your way back to us. That’s all that matters.”

Talon didn’t respond, but his hand tightened around hers, a silent acknowledgment of her words. They sat like that for a long time, the soft glow of the lanterns casting faint shadows around them.

When Griffin and Dystiny returned, they had managed to find a few more lanterns and some extra supplies. It wasn’t much, but it would have to do.

“Alright,” Griffin said, setting down the supplies. “Let’s get these lanterns rigged up and head for the cliffs. If Talon’s right, that’s our best shot at staying ahead of the Pulse.”

Sari nodded, helping Talon to his feet again. He was weak, but his determination was clear. He wasn’t going to let the Pulse take him again. None of them were.

They moved quickly, their steps lit by the warm glow of the lanterns as they made their way toward the cliffs. The wind had picked up again, and the Pulse’s presence loomed in the distance, a dark shadow waiting, watching.

But Sari kept her eyes forward, her hand gripping Talon’s tightly as they walked. The cliffs weren’t far now. If they could just make it…

“We’re almost there,” Griffin called back, his voice barely audible over the wind. “Keep moving.”

The cliffs rose before them, jagged and imposing against the dark sky. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as they neared the edge, her breath coming in quick, sharp bursts.

Talon stumbled, his body weak, but Sari held him up, refusing to let him fall. “We’re almost there,” she whispered. “Just a little further.”

And then, finally, they reached the edge.

The cliffs stretched out before them, a vast, open space that seemed untouched by the Pulse’s influence. The air was still, calm, and for the first time in what felt like days, Sari felt a sense of peace.

“We made it,” Dystiny said, her voice filled with disbelief. “We actually made it.”

Griffin let out a long breath, his body sagging with relief. “Yeah. We did.”

Sari helped Talon sit

 down, her heart swelling with hope. They were safe. For now, at least. 

But as she looked out over the cliffs, her gaze drifting to the horizon, a sense of unease settled in her chest.

The Pulse wasn’t done with them. Not yet.
