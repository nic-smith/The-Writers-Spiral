**Chapter 5: The Ascent**

The wind whipped harder as they ascended, sending chills deep into Sari’s bones. The temperature had dropped noticeably, and with each step, her muscles protested, aching from both the climb and the exhaustion that weighed on her like a heavy blanket. Her breaths came in short, shallow bursts, but she didn’t stop. None of them could afford to stop.

The higher they climbed, the more the landscape seemed to shift and twist around them. The jagged rocks jutted out from the mountainside like broken teeth, and the fog, though now farther below them, still felt like a looming presence, curling lazily in the valley beneath, as if waiting for them to make a wrong move and tumble back into its grasp.

Griffin was ahead, his flashlight barely cutting through the dimming light of the late afternoon. The sun was hidden behind thick clouds, and it was growing colder by the minute. Dystiny followed close behind him, her usual sarcastic energy replaced by a grim determination. She hadn’t complained about the climb, not once, but Sari could see the weariness in her eyes.

Sari lagged behind slightly, her mind clouded with thoughts of Talon. The fog below swirled endlessly in her mind, that distant shape she’d seen still haunting her every step. Whatever it was, it wasn’t human. And if the Pulse had already taken Talon, what would they find if they ever reached him?

“Keep moving,” Griffin called over his shoulder, his voice low but firm. “We can’t stop now.”

Sari nodded even though she wasn’t sure he could see her. Her body ached, her muscles screaming for rest, but Griffin was right. They couldn’t stop, not with whatever was in the fog below inching closer with every minute.

The path ahead narrowed, forcing them to move in single file along the cliffside. The drop to the valley below was steep, and Sari kept her eyes trained on her feet, careful not to misstep on the loose gravel and rock that shifted beneath her boots.

A sudden gust of wind sent a few small rocks tumbling over the edge, and Sari’s stomach clenched as she watched them disappear into the swirling fog below. The fog seemed almost alive, moving like a living thing, waiting for them to fall into its clutches.

“We’re almost there,” Griffin said, his voice strained from the climb. “Just a little farther.”

Sari wasn’t sure if he was saying that to reassure them or himself. Her body screamed for rest, but she pushed forward, her hands gripping the jagged rocks to steady herself as they continued their ascent.

After what felt like an eternity, they reached a small outcropping of rock, wide enough for them to stop and catch their breath. Griffin leaned against the cliff wall, wiping the sweat from his brow despite the cold. Dystiny dropped to the ground with a heavy sigh, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

Sari collapsed beside her, her legs trembling from the effort. The plateau they had reached earlier had given them a brief respite, but this climb had taken every ounce of energy she had left.

For a moment, they sat in silence, the wind howling around them, the distant sound of rocks shifting echoing off the mountain walls. Sari could feel the pulse of her heartbeat in her ears, loud and insistent, reminding her of how fragile their situation had become.

Griffin was the first to break the silence. “We need to figure out where to go next. This can’t be the top.”

Sari wiped her forehead with the back of her hand, her fingers numb from the cold. “How much farther do you think we can go? There’s only so much higher we can climb.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, and he stared at the path ahead. “We need to find some kind of shelter. A cave, an overhang—something that gives us cover.”

Dystiny groaned from where she lay on the ground. “I’m all for finding a nice, cozy cave, but do we even know if one exists? We’ve been climbing for hours, and the last cave we passed was halfway down the mountain.”

Sari’s chest tightened. She knew they were running out of options, but the thought of stopping—of being exposed to the Pulse—made her skin crawl.

“We can’t go back,” Sari said, her voice barely above a whisper. “That thing we saw in the fog… it’s still out there.”

Griffin gave a curt nod, his eyes hard. “We’re not going back. We push forward.”

Dystiny sat up, groaning as she did so. “You say that like it’s an easy choice.”

Griffin didn’t respond. His focus remained on the path ahead, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the rocky landscape for any sign of shelter.

Sari stood up slowly, her legs trembling beneath her, but she steadied herself against the rock wall. She looked out over the edge of the cliff, her eyes tracing the swirling fog below. It was still there, waiting.

“We need to keep moving,” Griffin said, his voice sharper now, more urgent. “It’s not safe here.”

Dystiny gave him a sideways glance but didn’t argue. She pushed herself to her feet, wobbling slightly before steadying herself. “Let’s just hope we don’t find any more of those fog monsters.”

Sari’s stomach twisted at the memory of the creature they had encountered earlier, the way it had screamed and thrashed in the mist. She still didn’t know what it was—or if it was part of the Pulse itself—but the thought of encountering something like that again made her skin crawl.

Griffin started moving again, his pace quicker now, more determined. The path ahead curved sharply, and the rocks beneath their feet were slick with moisture. Sari followed closely behind, her heart pounding in her chest.

The wind howled around them, the temperature dropping even further as they climbed higher. Sari’s breath fogged in the air, and her fingers were numb from the cold, but she forced herself to keep going. They couldn’t afford to stop now.

Suddenly, Griffin stopped, his body tensing. He held up a hand, signaling for them to be quiet. Sari froze, her heart racing as she strained to hear whatever had made him stop.

There it was—a faint, distant sound. It was low and rhythmic, almost like breathing, but too deep and too steady to be anything human.

“What is that?” Dystiny whispered, her voice trembling.

Griffin didn’t answer right away. His eyes were locked on the path ahead, and Sari could see the tension in his jaw, the way his body was coiled, ready to move.

“We need to keep moving,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. “Stay close, and stay quiet.”

Sari’s stomach churned with fear, but she nodded, her fingers tightening around the strap of her backpack. The sound was growing louder now, more distinct, and it sent a wave of dread through her. Whatever was making that noise—it was close.

Griffin led the way, his movements slow and deliberate as they continued along the narrow path. The sound of the breathing grew louder with every step, and Sari’s heart pounded in her chest, her mouth dry with fear.

They rounded the corner, and Sari’s breath caught in her throat. There, nestled in the rocks just ahead of them, was a large, dark opening—an entrance to a cave. But that wasn’t what made her freeze.

Lying just outside the cave entrance was a massive, hulking figure. It was partially obscured by the shadows, but Sari could see the outline of its twisted limbs, the way its chest rose and fell with each deep, steady breath.

It wasn’t human.

Her blood ran cold, and she stumbled backward, her eyes wide with terror.

Griffin held up a hand, motioning for them to stay back, but Sari could see the fear in his eyes.

The creature stirred, its limbs twitching as it shifted in its sleep. Sari’s heart raced, her mind screaming at her to run, but she couldn’t move. Her body was frozen in place, paralyzed by fear.

Griffin slowly stepped back, his hand gripping the flashlight tightly. “We need to go. Now.”

But before they could move, the creature’s eyes snapped open, glowing faintly in the dim light.

And then it let out a low, guttural growl.
