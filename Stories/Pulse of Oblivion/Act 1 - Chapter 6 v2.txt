**Chapter 6: The Awakening**

The creature’s growl rumbled low through the air, reverberating off the cave walls and sending a chill straight through Sari’s bones. Her breath caught in her throat, and she could feel her heart hammering in her chest, each beat loud and frantic. The glow from the creature’s eyes was faint, but enough to make the dark seem even more oppressive.

Griffin froze, his eyes locked on the creature’s massive form. The muscles in his jaw tightened, and Sari could see the tension in every inch of his body, coiled like a spring ready to snap.

“Back up,” Griffin whispered, barely moving his lips. “Slowly.”

Sari’s legs felt like lead, but she managed to take a cautious step backward, her boots scraping against the rocky path. Every movement felt amplified in the silence, and she feared even the sound of her breathing would alert the creature.

Dystiny was at her side, moving just as slowly, her face pale and eyes wide. There was none of the usual sarcasm or bravado in her expression—only fear. The kind that cut deep, the kind that told you there was no running from this.

Griffin took another step backward, his flashlight still trained on the cave entrance. The creature’s glowing eyes followed the beam of light, narrowing slightly as it raised its massive head.

The growl deepened.

Sari’s stomach twisted in knots as the creature shifted, its long, twisted limbs scraping against the rocky ground. She could see more of its form now—its body hunched and distorted, with limbs that seemed too long for its frame. Its skin was mottled and dark, blending into the shadows of the cave, and its breath came in deep, rattling gasps, like it was struggling to control itself.

She took another step back, her eyes never leaving the creature. Her heart raced as she tried to calm her breathing, but every fiber of her being was screaming at her to run.

But they couldn’t run. Not now.

The creature let out another low growl, louder this time, and Griffin’s hand shot out, motioning for them to stay perfectly still.

For a moment, time seemed to stretch out, the silence between them thick with tension. The wind howled around them, the cold biting into their skin, but the only sound Sari could hear was the creature’s breathing—and the thunderous pounding of her own heart.

And then the creature moved.

Its limbs twitched, its head jerking upward as it slowly rose from the ground. Its body was even larger than Sari had imagined, hulking and grotesque, its limbs long and spindly but strangely strong. It stood awkwardly, as though it wasn’t used to moving on its feet, but its eyes never left them.

Griffin took another cautious step back, his voice low and measured. “Stay calm. Don’t run.”

Sari’s throat felt tight, her body trembling with fear, but she nodded, her eyes locked on the creature as it moved closer. It let out another growl, deeper and more threatening this time, its long claws scraping against the stone as it lumbered toward them.

Dystiny’s breath hitched beside her, and Sari could see the panic rising in her friend’s eyes. They were running out of time—if the creature decided to attack, there was no way they’d outrun it.

Suddenly, the creature stopped. Its head snapped to the side, its glowing eyes narrowing as it turned its attention away from them, staring into the distance as if it had sensed something else.

For a moment, they all stood frozen, holding their breath, waiting.

And then, with a sharp snarl, the creature bolted.

It moved with a speed that Sari hadn’t expected, its long limbs propelling it forward as it disappeared into the shadows of the cave, leaving them standing there in stunned silence.

Griffin let out a slow, shaky breath, his shoulders sagging with relief. “It’s gone.”

Sari didn’t move. Her body was still frozen with fear, her mind struggling to process what had just happened. The creature had been so close—too close—and if it had decided to attack, there was no doubt in her mind they wouldn’t have survived.

“We need to move,” Griffin said, his voice still low but urgent. “Now, before it comes back.”

Dystiny nodded, her face pale but determined. “I’m all for getting the hell out of here.”

Sari’s legs felt weak beneath her, but she forced herself to move, her steps shaky as they hurried away from the cave. The cold wind whipped against her face, but it did little to calm the fear that still clawed at her insides.

They didn’t stop until they were a safe distance away from the cave, their breaths coming in short, sharp gasps as they leaned against the rocky path, catching their breath.

“What the hell was that thing?” Dystiny asked, her voice trembling. “I’ve never seen anything like that.”

Griffin shook his head, his jaw tight. “I don’t know. But it’s part of the Pulse. That much is clear.”

Sari’s stomach churned at his words. The Pulse wasn’t just some abstract force. It was real, tangible—and it was creating monsters. What if Talon had become something like that?

Her chest tightened, and she forced the thought away, not willing to confront it. Not yet.

“We need to keep moving,” Griffin said, his voice sharp. “We don’t know how many more of those things are out here.”

Sari nodded, though her body ached with exhaustion. She wanted to stop, to rest, but the fear of what was lurking in the fog drove her forward. They couldn’t afford to stop now. Not when the Pulse was growing stronger.

The group pressed on, the wind biting at their exposed skin as they continued up the mountain. The path became narrower, more treacherous, and Sari’s feet slipped on the loose gravel more than once, but she didn’t complain. The fear of what was behind them kept her moving.

Griffin led the way, his flashlight scanning the path ahead, but the light was weak now, barely cutting through the gathering darkness. The sun had long since disappeared behind the clouds, and the cold was becoming unbearable.

“Griffin,” Sari called out, her voice weak. “We can’t keep going like this. We need to stop.”

Griffin glanced back at her, his face tense. “We stop when we find shelter.”

Sari bit her lip, her eyes scanning the rocky terrain. There was no sign of another cave, no overhang they could use for cover. Just endless rock and the distant fog below, swirling like a living thing.

Her legs were shaking beneath her, every step more painful than the last, but she pushed forward, refusing to be the one to slow them down. They couldn’t afford to stop—not now.

The sound of the creature’s growl still echoed in her ears, and the image of its glowing eyes haunted her every step. The Pulse was more than just a force of nature. It was alive, and it was hunting them.

And then, suddenly, Griffin stopped.

Sari stumbled to a halt behind him, her breath catching in her throat as she saw what had made him freeze.

Ahead of them, nestled between two large boulders, was another cave. It was smaller than the last one, but it was deep enough to offer them some protection from the wind—and from whatever else was out there.

Griffin didn’t speak. He just motioned for them to follow as he stepped inside, his flashlight illuminating the narrow entrance. Sari hesitated for a moment, her eyes scanning the darkness, but then she followed, Dystiny close behind her.

The cave was cold, the air inside damp and musty, but it was shelter. And for now, that was enough.

Griffin set his flashlight down on the ground, the beam casting long shadows across the walls. He leaned against the rocky surface, his body sagging with exhaustion.

“We’ll rest here,” he said, his voice low. “Just for a few hours.”

Sari nodded, though her mind was still racing. The creature they had encountered earlier—it had been close, too close. And the Pulse was growing stronger.

She sank down to the ground, her body aching with exhaustion, but her mind refused to rest. The memory of Talon’s face—the way his eyes had changed, the way the fog had swallowed him whole—played over and over in her head.

What if they didn’t find him?

What if they did?

Dystiny sat beside her, her body trembling from the cold. “You think we’re safe here?”

Sari shook her head, her voice barely a whisper. “No.”
