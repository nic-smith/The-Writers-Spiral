**Chapter 1: The Cabin of Dreams**

The cold clung to Sari’s skin like a second layer, seeping into her bones despite the walls of the half-finished cabin. It felt as though the fog had found its way inside, pressing against her from all sides, suffocating her under its weight. She shivered, wrapping her arms around herself as she stared at the place they had once dreamed would be their refuge.

Now it felt more like a tomb.

The air inside the cabin was thick with tension. **Griffin** stood by the makeshift window, staring out into the distance where the forest disappeared into the mist. His broad shoulders were hunched, fists clenched tightly at his sides as if ready to fight whatever was out there, even though they both knew it was futile.

Behind him, **Daniel Graves** sat quietly in the corner, his back against the wall, his eyes closed in what seemed like meditation. His presence had always been calming, the group’s steady anchor in the storm, but even his silence couldn’t keep the pressure of the fog at bay.

“Do you think he’s still alive?” Griffin asked, his voice low, rough. The question hung in the air like a cloud of smoke.

Sari didn’t answer right away. She didn’t want to. She didn’t want to think about what had happened—about the way **Talon’s** face had changed right before the fog swallowed him whole, his eyes darkening with something unrecognizable, something terrifying. She pressed her lips together, her breath trembling as she fought to keep her emotions in check.

“He’s out there,” Sari finally said, though the words felt hollow, like a lie she told herself to keep from breaking. “He’s out there somewhere.”

Griffin didn’t respond. His jaw tightened, and he turned back to the window, his eyes scanning the thick mist that had swallowed the world outside. The fog had come for them days ago, creeping in slowly at first, like a predator stalking its prey. And then it had struck, tearing Talon away before any of them could react.

Now, all they had left was the cabin—their once-bright hope of freedom and safety, now a bleak reminder of everything that was slipping away.

“We have to find him,” Sari said suddenly, her voice sharper than she intended. “We can’t just stay here and wait for… whatever happens next.”

Griffin let out a bitter laugh, turning away from the window. “And what do you suggest we do, Sari? Go marching out into that?” He gestured toward the fog, his eyes flashing with frustration. “You saw what happened to Talon. You know what’s out there. You want to end up like him?”

Sari recoiled at his words, guilt twisting in her stomach. She knew Griffin wasn’t trying to hurt her, but the truth of his words cut deeper than anything else. She did know what was out there. And it terrified her.

But they couldn’t stay here. They couldn’t just wait.

“I can’t lose him,” Sari whispered, her voice barely audible. She wasn’t sure if she was talking to Griffin or to herself. Maybe both. “Not like this.”

Griffin’s expression softened, and for a moment, the tension between them eased. He stepped toward her, his hand resting on her shoulder. “We won’t lose him. But we can’t just rush out there without a plan. That fog… it’s not natural. There’s something in it. Something dangerous.”

Before Sari could respond, Daniel’s voice cut through the heavy silence. “We need to stay grounded,” he said quietly, opening his eyes. “Running out there isn’t going to fix this. We have to think. We have to stay calm.”

Griffin turned to face him, his frustration evident. “Calm? Talon’s out there, and we’re just sitting here, waiting for the fog to swallow us too. How does that help anyone?”

Daniel stood, his face calm and steady as always. “Rushing into the unknown won’t save Talon, Griffin. You know that. This fog—this Pulse—feeds on fear. It twists our perceptions, makes us act without thinking. We need to keep our heads if we’re going to find him.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue. Daniel had always been the voice of reason, the one who kept them from spiraling into panic. Sari felt a flicker of gratitude toward him, but it didn’t erase the gnawing fear in her chest.

“We built this cabin as a refuge,” Daniel continued, his eyes moving between Sari and Griffin. “But it’s more than just walls. It’s a reminder of why we’re here. We have to hold on to that.”

Sari swallowed hard, glancing at the unfinished beams overhead. The cabin had once been their symbol of hope—a place where they could finally be free. Now it felt like a prison. But Daniel was right. They couldn’t afford to let the fear consume them.

“Remember the vision board,” Daniel added. “What did we say we wanted when we built this place? What were our goals?”

Sari blinked, caught off guard by the question. “I… I wanted to keep everyone safe.”

Griffin scoffed, crossing his arms. “Yeah, well, look where that got us. Talon’s gone, and this fog isn’t going away.”

Daniel didn’t waver. “We’ll find him. But we need to keep our heads clear. The Pulse wants us to lose control. Don’t give it what it wants.”

A sudden sound broke the tension—a faint, distant creak, like the groan of old wood shifting under pressure. Sari’s heart lurched, and she spun toward the door.

Griffin was already moving, grabbing the hunting knife from the table and motioning for her to stay back. The fog was pressing in again, crawling across the porch like a living thing, its pale tendrils snaking toward the cracks in the door.

Griffin cursed under his breath. “It’s getting closer.”

Sari took a step back, her eyes wide as she watched the fog creep toward them. “What do we do?”

Griffin’s face was tense, his body coiled with the kind of alertness that told her he was ready to fight—but they both knew there was no fighting this. Not really.

“Get away from the door,” Griffin said finally, his voice low and steady. “We need to stay inside.”

Sari nodded, moving back toward the center of the room. Her mind raced as she tried to think of a way out, a way to stop the fog from coming in, but there was nothing. There was no escaping it. Not without Talon.

Daniel stepped toward the window, his eyes narrowing as he peered into the fog. “Stay calm,” he said softly. “We’ve faced worse than this.”

Griffin stayed by the door, his expression grim. The fog pressed harder against the windows, thickening by the second, and for a moment, Sari swore she saw something moving in it—something dark and shifting, like a shadow slithering through the mist.

She shuddered, her pulse quickening.

Griffin stepped back from the door, his face dark. “It’s coming for us.”

Sari’s breath caught in her throat. “What do you mean?”

“The Pulse,” Griffin said, his voice tight. “It’s not just after Talon. It’s after all of us.”

A cold wave of fear washed over her, and for the first time since the fog had appeared, Sari felt truly terrified. Not just for Talon. For all of them.
