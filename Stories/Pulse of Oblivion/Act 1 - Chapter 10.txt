**Chapter 10: Facing the Pulse**

The air felt heavier with every passing second, as if the Pulse were closing in on them, tightening its grip. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest, her breaths shallow and uneven. She stood with Griffin, Talon, and Dystiny in the small clearing, the weight of their decision hanging over them.

This was it.

They weren’t running anymore.

Sari clenched her fists, willing herself to stay calm. She could feel the Pulse in the distance, its presence creeping closer, like a cold hand brushing against her mind. She glanced at Talon beside her. He was quiet, but there was a steady determination in his eyes. He had faced his darkest fear and had come back from it. Now, it was time for all of them to do the same.

Dystiny paced restlessly, her usual humor nowhere to be found. “So… how does this work, exactly? We just stand here and, what, invite the Pulse into our heads?”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “No. We face it, but we control the narrative. The Pulse feeds on our emotions, but we won’t give it fear. We’re going to confront it with everything we’ve been holding back.”

Sari’s stomach churned, fear creeping up her spine. It wasn’t just the Pulse that terrified her—it was the thought of what it might drag out of her. The doubts, the regrets, the things she had buried so deep she had almost forgotten they were there. Almost.

But she couldn’t let fear win. Not now.

“We do this together,” she said, her voice steady despite the tremor she felt inside. “We face whatever comes, and we don’t let it break us.”

Talon gave a faint nod, his eyes focused on the distant horizon. “We’re stronger together.”

Dystiny stopped pacing, running a hand through her hair. “Alright, then. Let’s get this over with.”

Sari closed her eyes for a moment, centering herself, preparing for the inevitable storm. She could feel it—building, swirling, gaining strength as it fed off the emotions swirling in their minds. The Pulse was coming.

And then it hit.

The fog rolled in first, creeping along the ground like a living thing. The temperature dropped, and the wind picked up, carrying with it the faint, distorted whispers of the Pulse. Sari’s skin prickled, and her breath caught in her throat. The fog thickened around them, curling through the trees, swirling at their feet.

The Pulse was here.

Sari felt its presence, like a dark, looming shadow pressing against her mind, trying to worm its way inside. The fear rose up, sharp and fast, clawing at her chest, but she pushed it down. Not this time.

“Stay together,” Griffin called out, his voice low but strong. “We don’t give it power.”

The wind howled, and the fog closed in, but Sari held her ground. Her heart raced, her pulse thundered in her ears, but she refused to run. She had come too far. They all had.

The fog twisted and swirled, and Sari felt a sudden tug inside her mind—a pull, as if something were trying to drag her away from herself. Her vision blurred for a moment, and then, suddenly, she wasn’t standing in the clearing anymore.

She was home.

Her childhood home.

The small house stood before her, just as she remembered it. The overgrown yard, the peeling paint on the porch, the window with the cracked glass. Sari’s stomach dropped. She hadn’t been here in years. She had left this place behind.

But the Pulse hadn’t.

The front door creaked open, and Sari’s heart lurched in her chest. She knew what was coming. She knew, but she didn’t want to see it. She didn’t want to relive it.

But the Pulse wouldn’t let her go.

She stepped forward, her feet moving of their own accord, as though something were pulling her toward the house. She hesitated at the threshold, her breath catching in her throat. Inside, she could hear voices—familiar voices. Her parents. Her younger brother.

Sari swallowed hard, fighting the tears that welled in her eyes. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. They were gone. They had been gone for years. She had left them behind, had run from the memories, from the pain.

But now, the Pulse was dragging it all back.

She stepped inside, her legs trembling. The house was exactly as she remembered it. The worn furniture, the faded photographs on the walls, the smell of her mother’s cooking lingering in the air. It was so real. Too real.

And then she saw them.

Her parents stood in the kitchen, her mother stirring a pot on the stove, her father reading the paper at the table. Her brother sat nearby, his legs swinging beneath the chair, his face lit with a smile.

Sari’s heart shattered.

This was the life she had lost. The life she had tried so hard to forget.

“Come in, sweetheart,” her mother called, her voice warm and familiar. “Dinner’s almost ready.”

Sari’s chest tightened. She wanted to move, to speak, to say something—anything—but her voice caught in her throat.

This isn’t real. This isn’t real.

But it felt real. It felt so real.

Her brother turned to her, his smile fading as he looked at her with wide, questioning eyes. “Why did you leave us, Sari?”

Sari’s breath hitched, tears streaming down her face. “I—I didn’t mean to. I…”

The fog swirled around her, thickening, pressing in on her, drowning her in the weight of her guilt, her regret. She had run from this place, from this life. She had left them behind.

And now, the Pulse was making her face it.

Her father looked up from his paper, his eyes cold and accusing. “You abandoned us.”

Sari shook her head, backing away from them, her chest tight with panic. “No. I didn’t… I didn’t mean to…”

The walls of the house seemed to close in on her, the air growing heavier with every passing second. She couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t think.

The Pulse was winning.

But then, faintly, through the fog and the panic, she heard a voice. A real voice. A voice that wasn’t part of the illusion.

“Sari. Sari, listen to me.”

Griffin.

Sari’s eyes snapped open, and the illusion flickered for a moment, the house blurring around her. She could hear Griffin’s voice, calling to her, pulling her back.

“This isn’t real. It’s the Pulse. It’s trying to break you.”

Sari gasped, her mind reeling. The house, her parents, her brother—they weren’t real. They were gone. This was the Pulse, feeding on her guilt, her fear. She had to fight it. She had to let go.

She took a deep breath, steadying herself. “You’re not real,” she whispered, her voice shaky but growing stronger. “This isn’t real.”

The house flickered again, the walls trembling.

Her mother looked at her, her face softening. “Sari, stay. You don’t have to leave.”

Sari shook her head. “No. You’re not real. You’re not here.”

Her father’s voice grew harsher, louder. “You abandoned us. You don’t deserve peace.”

The fog pressed in on her, the weight of it crushing, suffocating. But Sari stood her ground. She wasn’t running. Not anymore.

“I didn’t abandon you,” she said, her voice steady. “I loved you. But you’re gone. You’re not real.”

The house trembled, the walls cracking, the furniture shaking. The illusion was breaking.

And then, with one final breath, Sari closed her eyes and let go.

The house crumbled around her, the voices fading into the distance, and when she opened her eyes, she was back in the clearing.

The fog was still thick, swirling around them, but she could see Griffin, Talon, and Dystiny standing nearby, each of them locked in their own battle with the Pulse. But they were still here. They were still fighting.

“Sari!” Griffin called, his voice breaking through the fog. “We’re still here.”

Sari nodded, her heart pounding. They weren’t done yet. But they were still standing.

The Pulse wasn’t going to break them.

Not today.
