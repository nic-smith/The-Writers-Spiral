**Chapter 6: The Light in the Dark**

The wind howled through the empty streets of the town as Sari, Griffin, and Dystiny moved toward the swirling mass of the Pulse. The lanterns, rigged with wires and powered by the generator Griffin had pieced together, clinked softly in their hands, casting faint glows in the thickening fog.

Sari’s heart thudded in her chest, each beat echoing with the weight of what lay ahead. The Pulse wasn’t just a storm. It wasn’t just some force of nature that could be easily fought. It was something else—something ancient and alive, feeding off their emotions, twisting their minds.

But they had the lanterns now. And more than that, they had each other. 

“Remember,” Griffin said as they neared the heart of the storm, his voice low and steady, “the Pulse feeds on fear. It will try to break us down, make us see things that aren’t real. We need to stick together, stay focused.”

Dystiny nodded, though her face was pale in the lantern’s soft light. “And if it tries to mess with our heads?”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “We fight it. We hold onto what’s real.”

Sari glanced at the folded vision board tucked into her jacket pocket. That was what was real. The cabin. The dream they’d shared. Talon. He was still in there, somewhere, trapped in the Pulse’s grip. And they were going to bring him back. 

She just hoped they weren’t too late.

The closer they got to the Pulse, the more oppressive the atmosphere became. The fog thickened, swirling around them like a living thing, and the wind carried whispers—faint, unsettling voices that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Sari shivered, gripping the lantern tightly in her hand.

Griffin stopped suddenly, raising a hand. “Wait.”

Sari and Dystiny froze, their eyes following Griffin’s gaze. Ahead, just beyond the swirling mass of the Pulse, stood Talon.

He was motionless, his body stiff, his face pale and expressionless. The fog curled around him, clinging to his form like a shroud. His eyes—once filled with warmth and life—were dark, hollow, staring blankly ahead.

“Talon…” Sari breathed, her heart aching at the sight of him.

Griffin held out his arm, blocking her path. “Wait.”

Sari’s jaw clenched in frustration. “We don’t have time to wait, Griffin. He’s right there.”

Griffin’s eyes darkened, his voice low. “That’s not him. Not really. The Pulse is using him to get to us.”

Sari’s stomach twisted. She knew he was right, but it didn’t make it any easier. Talon was standing there, so close, yet so far away. She could feel the Pulse’s influence pressing down on them, warping the air around them, making it hard to think, hard to breathe.

“We need to get the lanterns in place,” Griffin said, his voice snapping her back to reality. “Once they’re up, we’ll see if we can break through the Pulse’s hold on him.”

Dystiny nodded, moving quickly to set up the first lantern. The soft, warm glow expanded slightly as the lantern was placed on the ground, its light pushing back the thick fog just a little.

Sari knelt beside her, helping secure the lantern while Griffin moved to set up the next one. The storm around them seemed to react, the wind picking up, the fog swirling faster, as if the Pulse could feel what they were doing. It wasn’t going to let Talon go without a fight.

With the last of the lanterns in place, Griffin stepped back, his eyes narrowing as he watched the swirling storm. The lights flickered for a moment, and then they flared, brighter and stronger, casting beams of light that sliced through the fog, pushing it back.

The Pulse roared in response, the air vibrating with its power. Sari’s heart pounded in her chest as she stood, her eyes locked on Talon, still standing motionless in the center of the storm.

“This is it,” Griffin said, his voice tense. “We need to pull him out. Now.”

Sari took a deep breath, her hands shaking as she moved toward Talon. The light from the lanterns cut through the fog, illuminating the path ahead, but the air was still thick with tension, with the Pulse’s presence. It pressed down on her mind, filling her with doubt, with fear. 

What if they couldn’t save him? What if Talon was already gone?

No. She couldn’t think like that. She had to be strong. For him.

“Talon!” she called out, her voice steady despite the trembling in her chest. “Talon, can you hear me?”

He didn’t move. Didn’t react. The fog around him swirled, thick and heavy, but the light from the lanterns pushed it back just enough for Sari to step closer.

“Talon, it’s me. It’s Sari.” Her voice softened, her heart aching as she reached out toward him. “You don’t have to stay here. You don’t have to fight this alone.”

For a moment, there was nothing. No response. Just the low, ominous hum of the Pulse and the wind howling through the trees.

And then—his eyes flickered.

Sari’s breath caught in her throat, hope surging through her. “Talon,” she whispered, stepping closer. “Come back to me. Please.”

Talon’s lips parted, his body trembling as he fought against the Pulse’s grip. His eyes, still clouded with darkness, met hers, and for the first time in what felt like forever, she saw a flicker of recognition. 

But then, just as quickly, his face twisted in pain, his body jerking violently as the Pulse fought to drag him back into the darkness.

“No!” Sari cried, rushing forward, her hands grabbing his arms, pulling him toward the light. “You’re stronger than this! You can fight it!”

Talon’s body convulsed, his hands gripping hers so tightly it hurt, but Sari didn’t let go. She couldn’t let go.

Griffin and Dystiny moved in beside her, their faces tense with determination. “We’ve got you, Talon,” Griffin said, his voice steady, though his eyes were filled with fear. “We’re not leaving you.”

The Pulse roared again, the wind whipping around them, the fog thickening as it tried to push them back. But the lanterns flared even brighter, their light pushing the darkness further and further away, creating a protective barrier around them.

Talon gasped, his body jerking violently as the Pulse tried to pull him under. But Sari held on, her heart pounding as she poured every ounce of her strength into him. “We’re here,” she whispered. “We’re with you. You don’t have to fight this alone.”

Talon’s eyes fluttered, his breath ragged as he struggled to speak. “S-Sari…”

Her heart leaped. “Yes. I’m here. We’re all here.”

“I… I can’t…” His voice was weak, his body trembling under the weight of the Pulse’s power. “It’s too… strong.”

“No, it’s not,” Sari said firmly, her voice filled with conviction. “You’re stronger. You always have been.”

Talon’s eyes met hers, and for a brief moment, the darkness in them flickered, replaced by something else—something real. Something human.

But the Pulse wasn’t done with him yet. The storm surged, the wind howling louder, and the fog thickened again, pressing in around them.

Griffin gritted his teeth, his hands tightening around Talon’s arm. “We need to get him out of here. Now.”

Sari nodded, her grip tightening as she pulled Talon toward the lanterns, toward the light. The Pulse roared in protest, but the light was stronger now, pushing back the darkness, weakening the storm’s grip on him.

Step by step, they moved closer to the edge of the storm, the light from the lanterns growing brighter with each passing second. Talon stumbled, his legs weak beneath him, but Sari and Griffin held him up, refusing to let him fall.

“We’ve got you,” Sari whispered, her voice filled with determination. “We’re almost there.”

And then, finally, they stepped through the last of the fog, the light from the lanterns cutting through the darkness, creating a barrier between them and the Pulse.

Talon collapsed into their arms, his body trembling, but he was there. He was real. And for the first time since the Pulse had taken him, he was free.

Sari’s heart swelled with relief, tears streaming down her face as she held him close. “You’re back,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “You’re back.”

Talon’s grip on her tightened, his voice weak but steady. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I’m so sorry.”

But Sari shook her head, her heart filled with nothing but love and relief. “It doesn’t matter,” she said softly. “You’re here. That’s all that matters.”

Griffin let out a long breath, his body sagging with exhaustion as he glanced at the swirling storm behind them. The Pulse was still there, still lurking in the distance,

 but for now, they had won.

For now, they had brought Talon back.
