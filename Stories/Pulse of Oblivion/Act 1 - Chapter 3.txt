**Chapter 3: The Rising Tension**

The air inside the cabin felt heavier than the fog outside, pressing down on Sari’s shoulders as she and Griffin stood in silence. The coldness that had settled in her chest since Talon disappeared lingered, gnawing at her resolve. She wanted to move, to run after him, to drag him back from wherever the Pulse had taken him—but she couldn’t. Not yet.

Griffin finally broke the silence, his voice rough with fatigue. “We need a plan.”

Sari nodded absently, her mind still on Talon, still on the way his eyes had looked so… empty. It wasn’t just the fog clouding him—it was something deeper. The Pulse had its hooks in him, and she had no idea how to pull them out.

Griffin shifted, his hand rubbing at the back of his neck, a gesture she had seen countless times before when he was anxious. “I know you want to go after him right now, but we can’t just rush in blindly.”

Sari clenched her fists. She knew he was right. But the frustration and fear bubbling up inside her made it hard to think, hard to breathe. How could they sit here, planning, when Talon was out there, slipping further away with every second?

“I just—” Sari’s voice cracked, and she stopped herself, taking a deep breath. She had to be calm. She had to lead. “I know we can’t just go running into the fog, but we need to do something. We can’t just stay here.”

Griffin’s gaze softened, though his eyes were still clouded with worry. He’d always been the rational one, the steady hand in a storm. But even now, she could see the tension in his posture, the way his shoulders were tight with the weight of everything they were carrying. 

He opened his mouth to respond, but the cabin door swung open before he could say a word.

**Dystiny** burst into the room, her face flushed from running, her usually bright, expressive eyes filled with a mix of excitement and fear. “Guys, you’re not going to believe this.”

Sari blinked, her mind struggling to shift gears as she stared at her. Dystiny’s wild energy was a stark contrast to the suffocating gloom that had settled over the cabin. For a second, it felt disorienting, like reality itself was splitting into two separate threads.

Griffin’s brow furrowed, his protective instincts immediately kicking in. “What happened?”

Dystiny waved her hands animatedly, trying to catch her breath. “The Pulse… it’s changing. I saw it. There’s this… storm forming, but it’s not like anything I’ve ever seen. It’s… alive. It’s moving toward us.”

Sari’s heart lurched. The Pulse was coming. Closer. She felt the weight of it, bearing down on them, on her.

Griffin’s expression hardened, and he moved toward the door, his muscles tense. “How far away?”

Dystiny shook her head, biting her lip. “Not far. We’ve got maybe an hour before it hits us. Maybe less.”

Sari’s mind raced. An hour. That wasn’t enough time. Not for Talon. Not for any of them.

“We can’t stay here,” Griffin said, already pulling on his jacket. His movements were brisk, purposeful. “The cabin won’t hold if the Pulse is coming for us.”

Sari opened her mouth to protest, to say they couldn’t just leave this place behind. This cabin was supposed to be their refuge, their safe place. But Griffin was right. If the Pulse was coming, they had no choice but to go.

“What about Talon?” Sari asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Griffin paused, his eyes meeting hers. There was a hesitation there, a flicker of something she couldn’t quite place. Guilt, maybe. Or was it doubt?

“He’ll find us,” Griffin said finally, but even he didn’t seem convinced.

Sari swallowed hard. She couldn’t let herself think about losing him. Not yet.

Dystiny shifted on her feet, glancing between the two of them. “We need a plan,” she said, her voice rising with urgency. “Whatever that thing is out there, it’s coming fast. We don’t have time to argue.”

She was right. They didn’t have time to wait. Sari took a deep breath, trying to gather her thoughts, her resolve. “We need to head toward the cliffs,” she said, her voice steady. “There’s high ground there, and it might give us a better chance to see what we’re dealing with. Maybe we can get ahead of the Pulse before it reaches us.”

Griffin nodded, already moving to gather their supplies. “I’ll get the packs ready. Dystiny, check the radios. We might need to call for backup if we can’t handle this alone.”

Sari moved to the window, her eyes scanning the thickening fog outside. The Pulse was moving closer. She could feel it now, like a low hum vibrating through the earth. It wasn’t just coming for them—it was coming for everything.

She had to get Talon back before it was too late.

They left the cabin minutes later, the cold air biting at their skin as they moved through the dense forest. The fog hung thick around them, twisting the trees into strange, distorted shapes. It felt like walking through a nightmare, each step heavier than the last.

Griffin led the way, his posture tense and alert, while Dystiny trailed behind, her usual lighthearted energy dimmed by the weight of the situation. Sari stayed in the middle, her thoughts a tangled mess of fear, guilt, and desperation.

The Pulse was close now. She could feel it pressing in on her, pulling at the edges of her mind. But she couldn’t afford to break. Not yet. 

They reached the cliffs just as the wind began to pick up, howling through the trees and sending loose leaves spiraling through the air. The view from the top was breathtaking—if it hadn’t been for the sense of impending doom that hung over them like a storm cloud.

In the distance, a dark, swirling mass of energy twisted in the sky, a writhing vortex of shadows and light. It moved like a living thing, crawling across the landscape, devouring everything in its path.

Sari’s heart sank. “It’s worse than I thought.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened. “We’ll figure this out. We always do.”

But even as he said it, Sari could hear the uncertainty in his voice. This was different. This was something none of them had ever faced before.

The wind picked up again, and Dystiny let out a sharp gasp, her eyes wide as she pointed to the swirling mass. “Look!”

Sari followed her gaze, her breath catching in her throat.

In the center of the storm, barely visible through the chaos, was a figure.

**Talon**.

He stood at the heart of the Pulse, his body rigid, his face pale. But his eyes were no longer shadowed with doubt or fear. They were empty.

Sari’s heart clenched. This wasn’t Talon anymore.

“We have to get him out of there,” she said, her voice trembling.

Griffin stepped forward, his fists clenched. “We will.”

But deep down, Sari knew the truth. Talon was already gone.
