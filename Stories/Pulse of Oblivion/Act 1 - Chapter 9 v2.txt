**Chapter 9: The Pulse’s Grip**

The flickering light from the old lantern cast long shadows across the rocky ground as Sari, Griffin, and Dystiny gathered around it. Despite the warmth it promised, the glow from the lantern felt wrong—too perfect, too intentional. Sari’s instincts screamed at her to back away, to turn and run, but where would they go? They were in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by fog, and the Pulse was lurking in every shadow.

They stood in a tense silence, the weight of the moment pressing down on them like the fog that curled lazily just beyond the clearing. The lantern flickered, casting brief flashes of light across their tired, pale faces, and for a moment, Sari wished they could just sit here forever, in this moment of fragile light, before the Pulse swallowed them whole.

“We can’t stay here,” Griffin said, breaking the silence, his voice low but steady. “This light… it’s not real. It’s a trick.”

Dystiny scoffed softly, though there was no humor in it. “A trick? You think the fog is lighting lanterns for us now?”

Sari glanced at Griffin, her heart pounding. He wasn’t wrong. The lantern didn’t belong. It was too convenient, too placed. “What else could it be?” she asked, her voice trembling slightly.

Griffin knelt beside the lantern, inspecting it closely. The rusted metal was covered in dirt, the glass cracked in places, but it burned steadily. He shook his head. “I don’t know. But I don’t trust it. It’s here for a reason.”

Dystiny crossed her arms, shivering as the cold wind whipped through the clearing. “Okay, so it’s a trap. Great. But what’s the alternative? We wander around in the dark and hope we don’t fall off a cliff?”

Sari bit her lip, her mind racing. She didn’t want to follow the light. She didn’t want to fall into whatever trap the Pulse was laying for them. But Dystiny was right—they couldn’t stay here, and they couldn’t move blindly through the darkness.

“We don’t have a choice,” Griffin said, his voice tight. “We follow the light, but we stay alert. If anything feels off, we leave immediately.”

Sari swallowed hard, nodding in agreement, though fear gnawed at her insides. The Pulse had been testing them from the start—pushing, pulling, seeing how they would react. This light was just another piece of the puzzle, another layer of the trap.

But they couldn’t do nothing. They couldn’t just sit and wait for the Pulse to close in on them.

Griffin picked up the lantern, holding it in front of him as they prepared to move. The light flickered, casting strange, distorted shadows on the ground, but it was the only guide they had.

“Stay close,” Griffin muttered, his eyes scanning the fog. “And stay quiet.”

Sari’s pulse quickened as they began to walk, her boots crunching softly on the loose gravel. The path ahead was barely visible, the light from the lantern offering only a faint glow, but it was enough to keep them moving. The fog curled around them, thick and suffocating, but it didn’t press in like it had before. It felt like it was watching, waiting for them to make the next move.

They walked in silence, the only sounds the wind and their own breathing. Sari’s heart raced, her mind filled with thoughts of Talon—where he was, if he was even still alive. She had seen the way the Pulse twisted things, turned them into monsters. What if Talon was one of those creatures now? What if the person they found wasn’t her brother anymore?

She couldn’t think like that. Not yet.

As they walked, the landscape around them began to shift. The narrow, rocky path gave way to a flatter, more open stretch of ground, the fog thinning slightly as they moved forward. The mountains loomed behind them, dark and imposing, but ahead of them, the land seemed to stretch out endlessly into the mist.

Sari frowned, glancing at Griffin. “Where are we?”

Griffin didn’t answer immediately, his eyes focused on the path ahead. “I don’t know.”

Dystiny groaned, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. “Great. So we’re lost.”

Sari shivered, though it wasn’t just from the cold. The air felt different here—thicker, heavier. It was as if the Pulse was tightening its grip on them, drawing them deeper into its web.

And then she saw it.

Far ahead, barely visible through the fog, was a figure. It stood motionless, silhouetted against the faint light of the lantern, its form indistinct but undeniably human.

Sari’s heart leaped into her throat. “Talon?”

She moved forward instinctively, her breath catching in her chest. She couldn’t see the figure’s face, couldn’t make out any details, but something in her gut told her it was him. She had to believe it.

“Sari, wait,” Griffin called, his voice sharp.

But she didn’t stop. She couldn’t. She had spent too long searching, too long running. If that figure was Talon, she had to reach him.

The fog swirled around her as she broke into a run, her heart pounding, her legs trembling from exhaustion. She could hear Griffin and Dystiny calling after her, but their voices seemed distant, muffled by the fog.

“Talon!” she cried, her voice hoarse.

The figure didn’t move.

Sari’s chest tightened as she neared the figure. Her breath came in ragged gasps, her mind racing. Was it really him? Or was this just another trick?

And then, as she reached the figure, her blood ran cold.

It wasn’t Talon.

It was a man—tall and gaunt, his clothes tattered and dirty, his face pale and hollow. His eyes were wide, unblinking, staring straight ahead into the fog. He didn’t move, didn’t react to her presence. It was as if he didn’t even see her.

Sari stumbled backward, her breath catching in her throat. “Who—who are you?”

The man didn’t answer. He just stood there, motionless, his eyes empty.

Griffin and Dystiny caught up to her, both of them breathing heavily from the run. Griffin stepped in front of Sari, his body tense, shielding her from the man.

“Stay back,” Griffin warned, his voice low.

The man didn’t move, didn’t react. His eyes remained locked on the fog, his expression vacant.

Dystiny frowned, stepping closer. “What the hell is wrong with him?”

Sari’s heart raced, her mind spinning. The man’s presence felt wrong, out of place, like the lantern. He was here for a reason, but what that reason was, she couldn’t tell.

Griffin took a cautious step forward, his hand resting on the handle of his knife. “Can you hear me?” he asked, his voice calm but firm.

The man’s eyes flickered, just for a moment, but he still didn’t speak. His lips parted slightly, as if he were about to say something, but no words came out.

Sari’s stomach twisted in knots. The man wasn’t right. There was something off about him, something deeply unsettling. And then, without warning, the man’s eyes shifted—just for a second, his gaze locked onto Sari’s.

And she felt it—the Pulse.

It hit her like a wave, crashing into her mind, pulling her under. The world around her blurred, the fog thickening, and for a moment, she couldn’t breathe. Her vision swam, and she stumbled, her knees buckling beneath her.

“Sari!” Griffin’s voice seemed distant, muffled, as if he were shouting from miles away.

She couldn’t see. Couldn’t think.

The Pulse was inside her, crawling through her thoughts, twisting reality around her. The figure of the man distorted, his body warping into something monstrous, his eyes glowing with an unnatural light.

And then it was gone.

The wave of pressure lifted, and Sari gasped for air, her body trembling as she collapsed to the ground. Her mind raced, trying to make sense of what had just happened, but nothing made sense. The man—the Pulse—it had all blurred together in a chaotic mess of fear and confusion.

Griffin knelt beside her, his hands gripping her shoulders. “Sari, are you okay? What happened?”

Sari shook her head, her breath coming in shallow gasps. “The Pulse—it was in my head. It’s in him, Griffin. It’s controlling him.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, his eyes narrowing as he glanced back at the man, who still stood motionless, staring into the fog.

“We need to leave,” Griffin said, his voice tense. “Now.”

Dystiny didn’t argue. She helped Sari to her feet, her grip firm but gentle. “Come on. Let’s get out of here.”

Sari’s legs wobbled beneath her, but she forced herself to move. The Pulse had been inside her mind—she had felt it, twisting her thoughts, warping reality. And the man, whoever he was, was its puppet.

They couldn’t stay here. They had to get as far away from him—and the Pulse—as possible.

As they hurried away from the man,

 Sari cast one last glance over her shoulder. The man still stood there, motionless, his hollow eyes staring into the fog.

But this time, he was smiling.
