**Chapter 2: The Rising Tension**

The inside of the cabin felt smaller with each passing minute, as if the walls were slowly closing in around them. Sari sat near the small, makeshift table in the center of the room, her fingers absently tracing the worn edges of an old map. The cold wood beneath her hands was rough, unfinished—a stark contrast to the dream they’d once had for this place. The cabin had been their symbol of hope, a place to escape to. Now it was little more than a holding cell, keeping them trapped while the Pulse grew stronger.

**Griffin** stood near the door, his eyes locked on the swirling fog outside. The lantern next to him flickered weakly, casting long shadows across the room. Every so often, he would shift his weight or mutter something under his breath, the tension in his body palpable.

Sari could feel the same unease building inside her. The fog hadn’t moved closer, but its presence pressed against them like a predator, waiting for the right moment to strike. The Pulse wasn’t just some abstract force anymore—it was alive, and it was hunting them.

“We can’t stay here forever,” Sari said softly, breaking the silence.

Griffin didn’t look at her, his focus still on the fog. “I know.”

His voice was low, rough, like he hadn’t slept in days. Sari wanted to reach out, to say something that would ease the tension between them, but the words felt hollow in her throat. What was there to say? They were both thinking the same thing—Talon was out there, somewhere in that fog. And every minute they stayed inside felt like a betrayal.

“We should go after him,” Sari continued, her voice gaining strength. “He’s still alive, Griffin. I know he is.”

Finally, Griffin turned to face her, his expression hard. “And what if he’s not? What if whatever’s out there isn’t Talon anymore?”

Sari flinched at his words. She had seen the change in Talon’s eyes right before the fog swallowed him whole—how his face had gone blank, how his body had stiffened as though something else had taken control. But she couldn’t believe he was lost. Not yet.

“I won’t believe that,” she said firmly, standing up. “We can’t just give up on him.”

Griffin’s jaw tightened, his hands curling into fists. For a moment, the room was filled with nothing but the sound of the wind howling outside and the weak flicker of the lantern’s flame. Then he let out a long breath, his shoulders sagging under the weight of everything they’d been through.

“I’m not giving up,” Griffin said, his voice quieter now, more measured. “But running out there without a plan is suicide. You know that.”

Before Sari could respond, **Daniel Graves** stood from the corner where he had been silently watching. “Griffin’s right. We can’t let fear push us into action without thinking.” His voice was calm, but firm. He crossed the room to join them at the table, his eyes focused on the map Sari had been tracing. “We need a strategy. The Pulse feeds on rash decisions.”

Sari shot him a grateful look. Daniel had always been the calm in their storm, the one who saw the bigger picture. But even now, she felt the weight of the situation closing in. "What if Talon doesn't have time for a strategy?"

Daniel glanced at her. "We need to act smart. Not fast."

Griffin huffed, crossing his arms. “We don’t have time to wait for a perfect plan. Every second we’re in here, that thing out there gets closer.”

Before anyone could respond, the door creaked open, and **Dystiny** slipped inside, her face flushed from the cold. She brushed snow off her jacket, her usual playful energy replaced by something darker, more serious.

“Guys,” Dystiny said, her voice low. “We’ve got a problem.”

Griffin straightened immediately, his eyes narrowing. “What is it?”

“The fog—it’s moving. Slowly, but it’s coming closer.” She hesitated, glancing toward the window as if the fog might hear her. “And I saw something in it. Something big.”

Sari’s heart skipped a beat. “Something big? Like… Talon?”

Dystiny shook her head, her lips pressing into a thin line. “I don’t know. But whatever it was, it wasn’t friendly.”

Griffin cursed under his breath and grabbed his jacket, pulling it on with rough, angry movements. “We can’t wait anymore.”

Sari’s pulse quickened. “What are you doing?”

“We’re not waiting for the fog to come to us,” Griffin said, his eyes burning with determination. “We’re going to meet it head-on.”

Sari blinked, her mind racing to catch up with the sudden shift. “I thought you said running out there was suicide.”

“It is,” Griffin said grimly, grabbing a flashlight from the table. “But waiting here to die isn’t an option anymore.”

Dystiny nodded, her jaw set. “I’m with him. We can’t just sit here. That thing—whatever it is—won’t stop. And if Talon’s still out there, we need to find him.”

Sari felt a surge of anxiety rise in her chest. The thought of stepping into the fog made her stomach twist, but the idea of staying in the cabin, waiting for something worse to happen, was unbearable.

Daniel stepped forward, placing a hand on Griffin’s arm. “You’re right, Griffin. We can’t sit idle. But charging into the fog without thinking will only get us killed.” He glanced between the three of them, his voice steady. “We have to stay grounded. Keep our focus on why we’re here.”

Griffin clenched his jaw but said nothing. Daniel gave Sari a meaningful look, and she realized what he was doing—reminding them of the **vision board** they’d created when they built the cabin. The goals they’d set. The reason they hadn’t fallen apart yet.

Sari swallowed hard, steeling herself. “He’s right. We need to stick to the plan. We’ll find Talon, but we do it smart. We need to remember what we’re fighting for.”

Griffin met her gaze, and for a moment, the tension between them softened. “Fine. But we need to move. Now.”

Sari nodded, taking a deep breath to steady her nerves. She grabbed her jacket and the flashlight Griffin handed her. The small beam of light seemed almost laughable against the encroaching darkness outside, but it was better than nothing.

As they stepped out into the freezing air, the fog seemed to pulse around them, thickening as if it knew they were coming. Sari shuddered, pulling her jacket tighter around her as they moved toward the edge of the clearing. The trees loomed in front of them, half-hidden by the swirling mist, their twisted branches like the fingers of some long-forgotten monster.

Dystiny was right—the fog was moving. Slowly, but deliberately, inching closer to the cabin like a living thing. And then Sari saw it—a dark shape moving through the mist, large and slow, its form distorted by the shifting fog.

Her heart pounded in her chest as she gripped the flashlight tighter. “There. Do you see it?”

Griffin stepped forward, his eyes narrowing as he tried to make out the shape. “Yeah. I see it.”

Sari’s throat went dry. “Do you think it’s Talon?”

Griffin didn’t answer. He just kept moving toward the shape, his steps quick and purposeful, but Sari could see the tension in his shoulders, the way his fingers clenched around the handle of the flashlight. He was scared too.

The shape moved again, closer this time, and Sari caught a glimpse of something—dark, hulking, with long limbs that seemed to stretch unnaturally through the fog. Her blood ran cold. That wasn’t Talon.

“Griffin, wait!” she called, her voice catching in her throat. “That’s not him!”

Griffin stopped, his entire body going rigid. The shape in the fog moved again, and this time, it let out a low, guttural sound that sent a shiver down Sari’s spine.

Dystiny stepped forward, her face pale but determined. “We can’t outrun it. Whatever it is, we have to face it.”

Sari swallowed hard, her heart hammering in her chest. The fog closed in around them, and the dark shape loomed larger, its heavy footsteps thudding against the ground. There was no turning back now.

Griffin raised the flashlight, shining it directly into the mist. The beam cut through the fog, illuminating the figure in front of them. For a moment, Sari thought her heart might stop.

It wasn’t Talon.

It was something else entirely.
